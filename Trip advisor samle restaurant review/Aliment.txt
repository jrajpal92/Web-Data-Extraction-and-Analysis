Interesting items, but half good. Service was fine, but it was so warm inside the restaurant we were sweating even before trying the spicy fried chicken. Salmon cakes were cooked nicely, but nothing special.

Decent happy hour specials and friendliest bartender around.

Great little bar with exceptional food (try the brussel sprouts and pastrami slider). Happy hour specials are a plus with $5 small plates and $4 drafts. The bartender was extremely personable and welcoming. It's an awesome spot for a solo traveler to drop and meet fellow visitors and locals alike.

Lovely, just lovely. Tasty, fresh fare with a quirky zing added. Airy, light, modern and the cleanest restaurant with the friendliest staff. Eric (the owner) gets the whole experience nailed, and the Brussel sprouts are not to be missed - exceptional, with a tiny Thai twist. Just go - you will not be disappointed.

I typically skip reviewing places that I'd give less than an average rating, but just can't in this case. Aliment has a lot of potential that they just flub. It's a very cute, stylish spot with a decent buzz that maybe should just be a wine bar instead of a full blown restaurant. 4 of us had dinner the other night, and we all had a so-so to poor experience.First a nit - it annoys me when the online menu is nowhere close to the actual menu. Update it! I know it won't always be exact, and do not expect that but seeing 'Wild King Salmon' and 'Chicken Roulade' on the www sets an expectation. When we saw 'Smoked Salmon Cakes' and 'Korean Style Chicken' on the actual menu (among many other differences) we were disappointed.So among the 4 of us, we ordered the Brussels Sprouts, which were OK even though they were seasoned way too heavily with balsamic vinegar. The Chicken Wings just lacked anything inspiring, and we love chicken wings! They were very small, cooked fine, but just 'meh' as far as tantalizing the 'ol taste buds. We tried the Smoked Salmon Cakes, 3 panko breaded cakes. We ate 2 of the 3, there was nothing subtle about the smoke flavor and it was a bit over powering. And our friends both had the Ricotta Gnocchi. Neither of them had more than a couple bites. It arrived like a big glob of dough, not 'pillows of love' as they should be. And...it arrived cold.Our server, can't remember her name, was pleasant and attentive but, she served our friends cold food. So, unless I hear that they make some changes in the kitchen I wouldn't come back here, except to enjoy a glass of wine before dining somewhere else. There's too many good restaurants in this neighborhood to settle for 'meh'.

I am guided by trip advisor's comments to this restaurant. It's not bad... It's really not that great.The dinner menu has only 7 choices for starters and 6 choices for main. Nothing in the main attracts me so I picked a beef tartare and mussels.In general, I would say the seasoning is heavy handed and the food lacks sophistication. The beef tartare has so much capers and salt in it you can't taste the beef at all. For the mussels, again it's cooked with chorizo and heavy cream. And if you know what I mean, one bad mussel can ruin the whole pot.Both dishes come with bread and toast. They are not fresh, not warm and not crispy.The meal is $40. I would say it's average.

What stood out to me in addition to the great service and delicious food (enjoyed the gnocchi dish) is the lay out of the place. It is one of the few places in SF that you can actually have a conversation with your party and not feel like you are dining with the surrounding patrons. Love the different &quot;spaces&quot; created, there's an upstairs area, bar area, counter type seating looking out and several booths! Will definitely be back!

I cannot say enough wonderful things about Aliment: great menu, superb service, and lovely ambience.They had no problem making a dinner reservation for 10 ppl on a Friday night at 8, and (unlike most other restaurant we spoke to) did not insist on a prix-fixe. We did not tell them at the time, but this was our post-elopement dinner, and we were hoping for something special.Aliment succeeded :-)Not only did I love the wine list, but I even got to geek out with the waiter. I used to work in the industry and knowledgeable, warm, approachable staff are the exception rather than the rule, so this was a delightfully unexpected treat.Everyone ordered different dishes and everyone was ecstatic- a tall order given the party.Thanks, Aliment, for making our special day even more memorable.

We were lucky to get a seat in this very busy little restaurant and in the end this was only at the bar (which actually suited us as it made you more sociable and we ended up chatting to some lovely people and the bar staff).The gnocchi was lovely and the servings generous and not badly priced.The atmosphere was laid back and we stayed here for a few hours.Highly recommend.

I went in here based on the recommendation from the White Swan Hotel across the road. Definitely very helpful, informative and friendly service by Jarryd. ( he may be Gerard, not certain)This is a bar type restaurant which my own 30 year old kids would love. The place was rocking with animated conversation and high spirits. The menu has bar snacks, pastas/ entrees and small serves. It would be a great place to share food with a group. I ordered the cured salmon appetiser which is definitely a taste treat especially with its ginger overtones. My chicken wings were quite spicy and it would have made far better sense to share them but I valiantly ate them all. I needed two glasses of chilled water to keep me going as the Korean sauce was very spicy too.I think I had at least ten small winglets.Had to have a dessert to finish off and the chocolate cake with ice cream sounds very everyday but it is anything but. The cake is cooked in a small bowl and the chocolate is molten deliciousness. Must use the best chocolate too as there was none of that after taste you get from an inferior product.The wine was top class too. Not a cheap meal for one person but a memorable one.

We visited Aliment for the first time in Saturday and sat upstairs where there was another very loud and boisterous party of ten. We asked to be seated somewhere else but there was nothing was available. This is a small place that seats maybe 50. But the Loud party ruined an otherwise good dinner. We complained to Cari our waitress but she just shrugged her shoulders. But now on to the food . We ordered 3 salads and I liked the squash salad the best. The cured salmon appetizer was similar to a tuna tartare in preparation and presentation. The wings were ok . The Brussel sprouts were pan fried and well done. For the main entrees we shared the Gnochhi, Fettuccine which was creamy and cheesy and delicious, the Steak which was excellent and the Chicken roulade which was very good too. Overall good food but poor service

A nice, calm place with a fairly small menu, but good range of choices. There were 4 of us and 2 of us had the steak - both said it was fine. The others had the scallops and the chicken roulade. Both OK. Nothing really wrong, but the chicken was just a bit dried out and the things that came with the scallops were a bit of a salty mess.We ordered good wine, and had a great time, and the waitress was very nice. Overall, good but could have been better.

I had visited Aliment nine months ago with my daughter and her boyfriend and it was very good but my return visit was even better. The drink menu was imaginative, the starters (PEI mussels!, beet salad) were terrific. Our entrees, Pork Tenderloin, Grilled Chicken, Gnocchi, Scallops and Bolognese were each excellent and devoured with joy. Our desserts of Chocolate Cake, doughnuts and ice cream were fantastic. The party of five rang up a bill of $307.

The restaurant is located near the corner of Bush &amp; Mason. It's just a few (very uphill) blocks from the Curran and Geary theaters making it a good choice for dinner before a play. My daughter and her boyfriend and I met there a couple of nights ago for dinner and were very happy with our meals. they only serve beer &amp; wine so I ordered an excellent bottle of Remmelluri Rioja for $59 and it was delicious. Waiting for the kids I ordered the Butcher's Board selection of cheeses and meats and it was enormous. The server recommended that we only order two items per person so I had the riblets and the lamb, both were excellent. The kids split a hamburger and fries and were happy with that choice. My daughter had the riblets and her boyfriend had the fried chicken nuggets. Everything was very tasty. Comforting food at its best. They split the chocolate cake for dessert and we left very full (overly full in fact. The Butcher's Board, while wonderful, was too much food on top of the entrees). Dinner was $180 before tip.

My husband and I are in the city for a quick little getaway. I looked this place up online and noticed that it had pretty decent reviews, so we decided to try it. We were not disappointed. Their drink menu was filled with gin, whiskey, bitters type drinks- kinda hipster vibe. Their menu had some really great selections but we went with the strip steak, shrimp and grits, and kale beet salad. The salad was awesome- I wanted to go back and eat it again it was so amazing...And the portion size was manageable for one. The shrimp and grits, while I normally would only order them in the south, were fantastic without being too rich. I tried a bite of my husbands steak and it was seasoned well and cooked properly. Service was great and the bartender was appropriately attentive and obviously took pride in his job- watching them make cocktails was like watching a chemist- a few drops here, a little punch there- it was neat. Will come back as soon as i can.

Maybe it's just me, but when it actually *is* just me, I don't expect to be treated differently than when I eat with others. At this spot, I was offered a place at the bar or a terrible tucked away table near the fire extinguisher. My waitress actually rolled her eyes at me when I wanted to sit with a drink before ordering. I ordered a delicious dish called &quot;spatzel mac and cheese.&quot; She rolled her eyes a second time when I asked her to describe the dish (as spatzel and mac and cheese are two different things.) And she hurried me along. If she feared that as a singleton I would tip less, it became for her a self fulfilling prophecy.

Our first impression was a good one when we were seated quite pleasantly without a reservation (Though you definitely should make one). Unfortunately, we were pressed for time to make an evening performance, and our server was very accommodating, so we chose to sample some small plates. The highly praised brussel sprouts were deliciously unlike any vegetable dish, with a sweet nutty-like flavor. A must try even if you think you don't like them. I appreciate a server who will step out and actually make suggestions when asked. Thus we also stepped out and went with a Rueben style lean pastrami slider on a pretzel bun, lightly dressed with a French aioli and balanced with a subtle but tangy cider vinegar slaw. Finally, a lamb riblet was cooked perfectly, charred outside with a medium rare center. Slightly scented with a tarragon rub and served over a sweet/hot North African pepper sauce and some cooling Tatziki on the side. A wonderful marriage of flavors. You can definitely dine well with the small plates as an entree or enjoy them as appetizers. Several guests at other tables were ordering the large plate entrees and splitting to get the full experience. This is definitely a place to try again and again to sample the chef's creativity, and we will be sure to make reservations for a more extended meal next visit.

Aliment means to nourish, and that's exactly what it does, and to a very high standard. We have been travelling for a month and this is close to the best dining experience we have had, and we simply stumbled across it because it is near to our hotel. The restaurant looks great from the outside, is very appealing once inside, the server was also great, both our starters and mains were superb, and their wine list is good too. Absolutely nothing to fault. Go there if you want a quality night out.

Returning to our hotel after a day sightseeing, we spotted this restaurant a block up from our hotel. As we were flying out late that night, we only had about 90 minutes available for dinner. This was not a problem for the staff.We were ushered upstairs to the mezzanine level, and we're seated in an intimate space, without feeling crowded. The wait staff were courteous, prompt, and very knowledgeable about the cuisine on offer.The menu was well balanced with selections; we enjoyed the chorizo curry muscles, scallops and a lamb dish. Washed down with a most enjoyable Zinfandel!The real treat was dessert - no menu was presented - the waiter advised what was on offer! We shared an amazing pannacotta on black rice!!We left on time, feeling great that we had experienced this piece of San Francisco chic! The restaurant was packed on this Monday night - that speaks volumes! Do it!!

Our hotel recommended this restaurant so we hiked down Nob Hill to eat there. We looked over the limited menu and I picked out a butternut squash salad which came with curry dressing. I asked for it to be prepared with balsamic dressing. The balsamic was on the menu on a different salad. The waitress said she had to ask the chef if he would give me different dressing. She also asked me if there was a different salad I would like in case the chef wouldn't substitute the dressing. She came back and said that he said NO! My husband I decided to leave and said we thought the chef was a total jerk! I was only asking for different dressing. I asked if I had asked for dressing in the side would he have given me balsamic. She said he was already angry that I would ask to change dressings and couldn't ask him. Have you ever?!!!

We had a business dinner at Aliment, about eight of us. They gave us a quiet table on the second floor. If I was there just for fun, I would stay on the first floor which had a really cool vibe, dinner tables surrounding a big bar area. Noticeably absent, to my great relief, were the omnipresent TV's. Instead, they project old movies high on a blank wall with no sound. When we were there, they were showing the original Lawrence of Arabia.The food is quite good. The brussell sprouts appetizer was really good. So was the mac and cheese with bacon (they called it something else). My entree was a salmon steak which was excellent. Others in the group had a pork tenderloin that they raved about. Their wine and craft beer selection was really good.Next time my wife and I travel to San Francisco I want to bring her to Aliment. I think she would love it!

What a nice experience just out of the Nob Hill Hotels and financial district. Food is fresh, locally sourced and seasoned expertly. Veggies are truly remarkable. The Brussel sprouts and kale sides are perfection and not like what mom or grandma made you eat. Carmelized fish broth with the sprouts makes them otherworldly. Gnocchi, lamb and salmon as main courses are all done extremely well. They pair nicely with reasonably priced wines for SanFrancisco. The wait staff are attentive and knowledgable. All in all, a solid dining experience.

The place looked like place for drinks/ dinner. We were 2 adults 2 kids. Menu looked fine and music not too loud so we went in for a try anyway.Waitress was eager to sell us drinks though we said we wanted water only.We ordered spaghetti bolognese, ricotta gnocchi, foe grais meat balls, lamb steak and hamburger. Waitress said the portion was small and recommended us to order 1 more dish. We understood but preferred to see how it goes first.Then things went wrong. The lamb was too spicy for our girl (even for me). Spaghetti bolognese was also spicy but elder daughter kept quiet until much later. The waitress never got our order of ricotta gnocchi. She had to run to the kitchen to get it through for us.We asked for dessert menu but another high pitch waitress talked in a pitch that we couldn't understand anything except for chocolate pancake and apple martini?!Frankly she didn't make an effort to sell the dessert so we just left and resort to our chocolate cookies in the hotel.

We came here before a play. We had a burger and trout. The food was good, though $16 for a burger is a bit much, if you ask me. What irritated me was the $30 corkage. We usually bring our own wine, preferring to drink older wine, and are used to paying $20-25/bottle. Given their limited wine list, $30 is too much.

I got seated upstairs which was quite warm compared to the ground floor.The food was very good, and actually a good size. Unlike many of the oversized plates you see around many US restaurants, you could order a starter and still have plenty of room for a main.The service was good, however I can't help feel that because there wasn't a waiter in the top seating area that they may not have been as attentive as they could have. I couldn't complain about the service though.A good dining experience, right near a lot of hotels.

This restaurant was quite a find; located in the hotel district already well serviced by many restaurants. But Aliment is different, with a very clever combination of fresh ingredients, special combinations and exquisite flavours. The lamb with yoghurt, artichoke salad, Japanese Salad, shrimp and kale salad are all winners. We shared 4 small plates between two, and that makes for an ample dining experience. The wine list is also excellent, and very good value. We found that we paid about half of the tariff at comparable restaurants in the same area. It was so good we returned for a second night. Top marks.

I stopped here with my two little children tonight after having read some yelp reviews and because I did not want to go to the overpriced hotel eatery. Although this place is not for children (read: no crayons and coloring sheets), you can easily choose food for them - my kids had chicken bits, fried brussels sprouts, and fries. I also shared with them a burger and shrimp with grits. The burger was simply amazing - probably the best I have had in ages with some awesome sauces. And the rest of the above mentioned food was great too. We finished the dinner with chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream and some caramel sauce. I wished I had more people in my party to have been able to order and taste more of their dishes (mussels looked and smelled awesome). Definitely coming back when I am in SF again.

I had a work event that I needed to plan dinner for 30 people. I wanted it fun and tasty, with a decent wine list. The food was amazing and the staff was great, they got almost all of the food out very quickly and service was fabulous. I would recommend this for 2 or for 30!

We ate here with a large group of 22. The food is served in small portions, almost like tapas servings. We enjoyed a melon salad and brussel sprouts. The riblets were excellent as was the steak. The plate presentations were very artistically displayed...almost too pretty to eat. Our group was seated in a private room upstairs. The service was excellent and we would definitely go back. It is pricey but worth the experience and cost. Enjoy!

We went into this restaurant because our receptionist had mentioned it. We had already eaten but on reading the menu, we decided to share the cheeseboard which consisted of delicious bread, assorted cheeses, meats, their own take on pickles, etc. -delicious. Other meals being served there looked appetising and interesting.Because we hadn't made a reservation, we were asked if we would mind eating at the bar which we actually enjoyed as the bar was a lot deeper than usual. Tables are also set out in the gallery above. A very modern but comfortable restaurant with welcoming staff

The restaurant is located near the corner of Bush &amp; Mason. It's just a few (very uphill) blocks from the Curran and Geary theaters making it a good choice for dinner before a play. My daughter and her boyfriend and I met there a couple of nights ago for dinner and were very happy with our meals. they only serve beer &amp; wine so I ordered an excellent bottle of Remmelluri Rioja for $59 and it was delicious. Waiting for the kids I ordered the Butcher's Board selection of cheeses and meats and it was enormous. The server recommended that we only order two items per person so I had the riblets and the lamb, both were excellent. The kids split a hamburger and fries and were happy with that choice. My daughter had the riblets and her boyfriend had the fried chicken nuggets. Everything was very tasty. Comforting food at its best. They split the chocolate cake for dessert and we left very full (overly full in fact. The Butcher's Board, while wonderful, was too much food on top of the entrees). Dinner was $180 before tip.

I had visited Aliment nine months ago with my daughter and her boyfriend and it was very good but my return visit was even better. The drink menu was imaginative, the starters (PEI mussels!, beet salad) were terrific. Our entrees, Pork Tenderloin, Grilled Chicken, Gnocchi, Scallops and Bolognese were each excellent and devoured with joy. Our desserts of Chocolate Cake, doughnuts and ice cream were fantastic. The party of five rang up a bill of $307.

Stopped in here after a lengthy walk attracted by the energy apparent from the outside. Got a table in the mezzanine, two glasses of bubbles and browsed the menu. It's shared dishes, short but definitely sweet and a good mix of meat and not meat. Four were plenty, foie gras meatballs almost the highlight but pipped by the best brussel sprouts you will ever taste (truly, and I am not a vegetable person). Done with fish sauce caramel, toasted nori and sesame seeds, the dish is symptomatic of the other dishes - interesting flavours but clean and not overly fussy.Attentive and knowledgable service and a good bottle of Pinot topped it off.Would readily go back which is pretty much all you can ask for.

Visited twice in one week, one week night and then that weekend. The week night visit was great, I tried 3 things, was blown away and couldn't wait to come back- that night I would have given them 5-stars. On the weekend, brought some friends and told them it would be great. Had the same 3 things (among others), one was inedible (smoked cod so salty you could not eat it), butler steak (way too much chimichurri on it), and fried chicken bits were soggy, the breading was not nice and crisp like before. SOOOOOOO disappointing- the consensus was that a different chef or chefs had made our second meal, and they were WAYYYYY too heavy handed. We loved the balanced flavors the first time, but the second time there was just no finesse and some of what was there was overdone (steak) or poorly done (chicken). On the plus side, we tried the gnocchi on the weekend visit and it was easily the best thing of the night- it was cooked perfectly.

When visiting San Francisco I was looking for a restaurant with interesting food that was close to our hotel. Aliment is only 2 blocks down the hill from the Intercontinental. Menu looked promising, so I booked a table. And I am happy to report that it did not disappoint.This is one of those places that offers rather small selection of well executed dishes. All the plates are tapas, so you will need probably 4-5 for a table of 2.We went for the squash salad, which was outstanding. Squash was nice and crunchy and the creamy dressing had nice curry flavor, which was very interesting and also delicious.Next dish was the smoked fish. They offered codfish that day, which is one of my favorite. It comes with some crackers, and nicely seasoned veggies and pickles. It was our least favorite dish, but it was still very tasty.Kurabuta pork belly was out of this world. Definitely try that if you visit. It was tender, yet crispy, and nicely seasoned.Braised duck was filled with Asian flavors. It worked well for me.The only little let down were the desserts. They only offered freshly made glazed donuts and/or house made ice cream. We ordered both, and were perfectly happy, simply cause donuts and ice cream make everybody happy. But in the future I would love to see something a bit more creative and interesting on the menu.The server was excellent, constantly checking up on us. This is definitely a great find for locals and for tourists as well.

Dinner at Aliment was a last minute decision. The menu looked like what we were in the mood for, so we went in. The service was attentive and pleasant--our server answered questions quite thoroughly and seemed happy to spend as much time as needed to help us make our choices. We appreciated the chic, modern minimalist design although the place was rather noisy as a result of the hard surfaces.The food came quickly (nice, because we were quite hungry) and started with the salads. The salads were among the very best I have ever tasted. I would go back there again for the salads alone. Both the Japanese Mixed Greens and the Roasted Squash Salad were interesting, complex, and very well thought out and we adored every bite.Unfortunately the rest of our meal did not meet the same standards. Our duck dish was a noble attempt at interesting fusion, but the sesame oil overpowered the flavor of the rest of the greens and most of the duck. The Arctic char fared somewhat better. While the hummos and other bits that came with it were somewhat bland, they did at least compliment the fish rather than fight with it. Clearly the kitchen was trying to be innovative, but the dishes as presented need more work.We were glad we went there and, as I said, I would go back for just the salads. But I wouldn't order anything else.

We enjoyed a very pleasant dinner here. Attentive waitstaff, good food. Portions were large enough to share. Note that salt and pepper is not provided on the table, nor are they offered. Not an issue for us, or for the dishes we ate, but others may disagree. Choose a table or booth toward the front if you can; there is an open kitchen at the back, which was not only noisy but smoky when we were there.

Aliment is a nice restaurant to share a meal and quiet evening. The staff is attentive and the ambiance unique. The night we were there, old back and white movies played on the wall. It was funky and not distracting yet cool.The food was very good. We enjoyed a kale salad with a great avocado dressing, chocolate cake for dessert, fried Brussel sprouts, and braised duck bits. All were small bites and tasty. We shared the items above and left satisfied. I would definitely return to try some other items.

On a recent visit to San Francisco I ate at Aliment. The food was well prepared but the portion was small. Also I thought that they forgot to serve me bread and so I asked for it. I was given three slices of bread. When I got the bill I was charged $4 for three small slices of bread. I was never told there would be a charge and the menu never mentioned a charge for bread. I felt that this was a chintzy/cheesy thing to do. It took away from good dining.

My husband and I took a previous reviewer's advice and ordered our own salads and shared the entree. Unless you are truly starving, that's enough food. I had a terrific salad of fresh greens, ricotta, roasted squash and hazelnuts. It was large and yum! My husband liked his duck salad.We shared locally caught, perfectly prepared halibut. This was topped off with coconut ice cream. If you are a coconut fan, like me, it was outrageously good. There were big strands of coconut within and two large scoops in the serving.

After a challenging up hill hike to this neighborhood gem, we were welcomed by a very friendly staff.We reviewed the limited menu, but based on recommendations we knew what we were ordering. Four of started with Brussels sprouts and mussels and both were excellent. They would have made a wonderful meal.For meals we ordered the pork shank that are large and meaty, an excellent choice. Another order chicken and loved it. I ordered the Bolognese that was made with spicy Italian sausage. It was very good, but the pork shanks got the top marks.Only negative was the drink prices were expensive.

I don't think San Francisco really need another non descript trendy restaurant. The food is decent, but the smell is really disgusting, when I got home had to put all my clothes outdoor, the were smelling like fried fish. If you pass by and don't know where else to go, this place is ok, but is definitely not worth a trip just to have dinner there

Sunday night - not absolutely full. We were seated upstairs on the gallery. The food was excellent - though the scallops might have been even better without the curry sauce - and the steaks were some of the best we have had outside Argentina, but the restaurant was really quite noisy. Wine somewhat overpriced - if delicious. Good for a special occasion.

We also got food envy about the Brussel sprout appetizer the couple next to us had and the waiter got the chef to make us a small dish too, which was super tasty! Salmon entree was great, lovely side salad and sauce, the chicken main was good too, but the side corn side was a bit stodgy. Incredible flour less chocolate dessert!

Was here for early dinner on a weeknight. This is a popular place so place call ahead for reservations. Service was prompt and adequate. We ordered scallops, Brussels sprouts, pork chop and a fruit cobbler for dessert. All are tasty. Menus are seasonal. Portion size for the Brussels sprouts was generous and probably should be shared as an appetizer.The price is ok for downtown SF- not cheap for a place with such causal decor and atmosphere but I wouldn't say it's expensive for the quality of food you get.The only complaint is that all salads are pre mixed and cannot accommodate special requests such as dressing quantity and omitting certain ingredients.

On Nob Hill, this is a trendy-looking place with well-executed food, dominated by meat. Couldn't bring myself to try the Brussels sprouts but plenty of those plates went out. Serves are generous. We tried a range of dishes on two visits - scallops, bolognese, pork belly, pork chop and pastrami short rib and all were very good. The flourless chocolate cake for dessert was particularly good. Lots of very good wines are available by the glass, including dessert wines. The space is dominated by booths along one wall and, if they're busy, it means only bar seating for groups of two, unless you want to head up to the mezzanine level - which is a haven for bigger groups. It's noisy and lively.

Alright, so I had a few drinks before I got here, so this may not be the most accurate review.The food was good, but not special. Service was great though!We had a caesar salad that was basically romaine with some dressing and parm.The brussels sprouts are really tasty and they give you a ton! They are a little too sweet for my taste, but still pretty damn good.I had the gnocchi for dinner. There was an option to add bacon, so of course I did, but I regretted it. The whole dish wound up tasting too smoked-bacony. I was expecting something more like pancetta but this tasted like supermarket bacon.My sister had the shortrib entree, and that was really rich and tasty. My wine (the malbec) was so-so, but I had a sip of the zinfandel and it was pretty good.I'd go back - but it may be a little overpriced for the quality of the food. I think with a new chef, this place could do really well.

We happened into this place on a recommendation from our hotel. WOW...what a great experience.First of all, ambiance is cool and kitschy, with a trendy vibe.

Fabulous selection of beers for my husband, and a good wine list for me.We had fried brussel sprouts for our appetizer. Slightly too salty, but tasty nonetheless.My husband had fall off the bone short ribs and I had simply the best bolognese (pasta and sauce house made) that I have had since my Noni was alive!We never felt rushed, and we sat and chatted with the bartender and other patrons well into the evening.No kidding...I hope to return to SF soon, and would go here to eat no matter where I was staying in town!

We came here before a play. We had a burger and trout. The food was good, though $16 for a burger is a bit much, if you ask me. What irritated me was the $30 corkage. We usually bring our own wine, preferring to drink older wine, and are used to paying $20-25/bottle. Given their limited wine list, $30 is too much.

A friend suggested this eatery for dinner because it was close to our hotel. My initial impression was good: they just began taking reservations, and the hostess was very friendly. Things went downhill from there, though. The lights were too dim for my elderly mother to read the menu, and after agreeing to brighten the lights briefly and/or light a candle, the server ultimately did neither - lighting everyone's candle BUT ours. Also, the menu was largely unreadable, even for someone with good vision. Every dish and wine seemed to be described in a language I couldn't understand -- too many fancy words for what turned out to be only average food. I had a &quot;wagyu beef&quot; burger that was overcooked and dry, served with fries and smoked ketchup that never materialized. The &quot;little gems&quot; salad was also disappointing - gently braised hearts of romaine, blue cheese bits, and not enough vinaigrette. My sister didn't like her soup, either. The trout was good, but that was all you got on the plate, and we had to ask for bread. We topped it all off with an overpriced bottle of decidedly ordinary California Zinfandel. After all was said and done, we paid a couple hundred dollars for four light eaters. I won't be going back.
