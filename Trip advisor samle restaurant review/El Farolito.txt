Mixed feelings with el farolito

Thursday night, el farolito with some friends. The place is a taqueria where you pay what you get. Good prices, big food, mexican atmosphere with mariachis and all. El farolito can be a bit cleaner and after eating we did feel a bit wierd but maybe it was mexican food+high temperature. Would recommend but I believe there must be better places to eat some amazing tacos in San Francisco

This place is very popular with both tourists and locals. It is open very late at night, too. That being said, you can get better Mexican food by just crossing 24th Street and going to one of several other restaurants that have better food, are cleaner and nicer to sit in while you eat...for the same price and with more extensive menus.

If you hit this place right, you will experience the best Mexican food in The Mission. One slight problem: it is super popular, so you may wind up in a line down the street. The portions are super plentiful. I had a veggie burrito, and although I have a ravenous appetite, I had to take some home. The prices are reasonable. The Mission is gentrifying before one's very eyes. This place has managed to hang on. I adore this place!

just back from SF. Hit a bunch of other taquerias - just to keep my opinions fresh and sharp - these guys are far and away the best fast food Mexican I have encountered - probably anywhere.The chile relleno is amazing. Two delicious chile rellenos with beans, rice and chips for 10 bucks. Great salsa available for freeThe decor is a bit gritty but it doesn't pretend to be a linen table cloth sort of place. They make delicious food and they move people thru really quickly and I wish they had a shop in my city.Always the best.

I go here every time I come to San Francisco. It's been fabulous for years. It's not fancy, it's just good good food at very reasonable prices. I love the super burrito with carne asada and the chile relleno. Each is too big for any normal human to be able to consume in one sitting, but it is a great time trying.They have wonderful salsa. It gets busy at lunch time.Lots of beer and mexican sodas available too.And really reasonable prices. Can't say enough about this place. It's my favorite place to eat in SF.

Great and authentic Mexican food. The waiters and waitresses speak mostly spanish and the food is real good. We were back from Muir woods after a day of trailing and were starving.

HUGE PORTIONS! Apparently this place won a &quot;best burrito&quot; award some time ago, and it is indeed a great burrito. I got a super burrito with carne asada and no sour cream, and it was awesome! The meat was so flavorful and I was super impressed that they used actual avocado, not guacamole (or worse, guacamole paste). The fresh avocado added so much more flavor. The burrito was way too big, it's enough to eat one and last you for the rest of the day. The salsas were pretty good too though not extraordinary. But, really delicious burrito. This place gets crowded during lunch time so it's probably better to take to-go, but if you're willing to wait you'll probably be able to snag a table! $8.43 post-tax for the burrito is a bit high, but considering the great portions, it's definitely fine. I daresay you could share with another and be perfectly full. Highly recommend; also convenient to get to; it's about a 10-15 minute walk from 16th St Mission BART.

We stopped in here since it was close to the 24th St BART station, on a recent visit to SF. There was a line when we entered which moved quickly. Got a carnitas burrito which was absolutely enormous - it felt like it weight at least 2 pounds! We split this between two of us and it made for an ample dinner. The salsas by the register were a great addition to the burrito. For the money, a good value.

Waited in line to see what this place was all about. The wait (surprisingly quick line), was definitely worth it. I ordered the sesos and lengua tacos and both were on point. Very flavorful and their salsa verde was really good. Someone in our party also ordered a burrito and it was awesome (had to taste it). You definitely get a good amount of food for the price. I'll be going back for sure.

The burritos here are worth the effort to find this place. The burrito was huge and delicious. We ate lunch here several times while in SF. I highly recommend you try it out with one warning. It is a small place with limited seating though we had no problem getting a table. Most people buy their food and leave.The salsa was incredibly delicious. They make it themselves.Also try the pink drink that you can see behind the counter. It has a great taste.I highly recommend this inexpensive Mexican food restaurant.

This is a big menu, and it is all good! My favorite is the Chile Verde Pork dinner plate (which you can get all day).The refried beans with cheese, the rice, and the delicious Pork Chile Verde is a wonderful dish. They include four soft tortillas and also chips. It's a lot of food, and scrumptious! Easily two meals.The ambience is not much, but sufficient for a typical taqueria.Great taste and great value!

Well, almost everyday. Get the carnitas quesadilla, you will not be disappointed. There are two locations in the Mission! There's one on Mission and one on 24th. Go to the one on 24th, its a short walk and there's rarely a line like the one on Mission. One of the most reliable and delicious burritos in San Francisco!

The nachos are terrific and the carne asada plate massive - will try the beef tongue burrito next time!

El Farolito is an institution. The burritos are always good, but pretty standard. The late night scene is still very much &quot;The Mission&quot; despite the big tech invasion.The only thing that bothered us was the extreme use of disposable stuff. Even when you order &quot;for here&quot; (as opposed to &quot;to go&quot;), it's plastic everything. Knives, forks, salsa containers... They are a trash factory.The food is always good, so I'll be back.

Well on my trip to San Francisco where I lived for over 40 years after going to hear the best Salsa music and dancing, I said to my friends let us go here, next door to the Bart Station. My tostada with chicken and I got avocado and no cheese was absolutely filling and delicious. I truly don't know why it is so much better than any I have tasted in Los Angeles (Westside). Lots of local flavor and like said before right in the hub of the Mission. My friends shared a veggie burrito and got chips, yummy!!!!!

I learned about this place on yelp when looking for a good Mexican restaurant in the Mission area of SF.I most likely would have walked right by it had I not been looking for it. A small, unassuming place that blends into the surroundings. It was quite busy, there is limited booth seating and not much room to stand and order. The food was plentiful, cheap and good! We got the chicken burrito, tacos and chips for $12. The burrito was huge with lots tasty chicken, beans, rice , salsa (and onions). Service was fast and polite. It doesn't seem like the cleanest place, but as SF has the health 'scores' displayed,I saw it received 90/100. Would return if in that area again!

I have to agree with other reviewers: this is a great place to eat in the Mission. I can't say that I've tried many places in the area, but after eating here, I see no reason to make that effort. I love Mexican food in general, and El Farolito hits it spot on -- great fresh food, nice variety, local clientele, very authentic and absoutely delicious. Plus, they have a massive advantage in location: just adjacent to a BART station. The few times I've been here for lunch there has been no line (I don't know about evenings); and while the interior decor is not exactly romantic, I think it also adds flavor to the experience. This is the Mission, enjoy its varied aspects!

We love the food. The portions are huge, the ingredients fresh, and the meat was seasoned to perfection. Our order was enchilada and carnitas and was great. We visited about 20:00 in the evening on a Saturday and it was full with maybe 15-20 customer in line. Actually I was glad it was full because it gave my wife and I a convenient rationalization for eating in the car. The restaurant is very unpleasant. It was dirty, there is scarcely enough room to place and order and wait for it, and the noise level is tremendous. To a certain extent all this is a tribute to El Farolito's success. It is definitely a great place to get Mexican cuisine, but be sure to order take out.

...but, unfortunately, they'd already closed, so I circled the neighhood and saw El Farolito. It was all lit up, had several customers, there was a parking spot right next to it, so, I went in and got an Enchilada Plate for today, a very large Burrito for then, and 2 quesadillas. The employees were so sweet and the place was clean. Sadly, there's something odd about their tomato sauce. It's got a strange perfumey, sweet, taste to it, and some of the pieces of grilled chicken didn't seem grilled, more like boiled. The simplicity of a quesadilla didn't factor into theirs. They too had an odd under-taste, or whatever. I was extremely hungry so I ate 1/2 the burrito, and both quesadillas, but I hate to say this, I'm never going back.

I had the enchiladas with grilled chicken. You get two with salad, avocado and sour cream and a big portion of rice and beans. I did not want to stop eating it, but was very full after a while (they offered to wrap the leftovers). This is real food and it tasted very good. Busy, with lots of people eating there, but also taking out. Portions are big and prices are reasonable. Friendly staff. Lighting is very bright, but I think that's normal for these types of places. Don't go here for a romantic dinner, but if you want good Mexican food, do visit. If only they had a place like this back home.

This place has been around forever- it used to be our late night go to back in college a decade (or two!) ago and doesn't seem to have changed a bit. Don't let a line out the door discourage you- and make sure you come hungry! Burritos are massive and have just the right amount of everything to make every bite delish. Seems odd to be raving so much about something as basic as a burrito- but trust me- it puts all others to shame.

Oh, and go to Yelp and ask where you can get the best burritos in SF and it's always numero uno! Makes me hungry just thinking about it. Mmmmmm....

I came about this place in a YouTube video on how to avoid tourist traps, since I was visiting from out of town. Without knowing much and seeking an authentic &quot;local&quot; experieence, I headed over there and ordered the Super Burrito Carne Asada. I could barely finish it - it's HUGE and it's cheap (under 7$). I loved every bite.Later that evening I found out two things from speaking with some locals: El Farolito has a reputation for serving the best burrito in town, although they had not visited. and that it's not the nicest neighbourhood. However, I did not agree with the latter. It does not look like the nicest, but I did not feel unsafe. It felt like a very authentic &quot;local&quot; experience, which is just what I was craving as an out of towner. All kinds of people visit, from very young to very old.

Seriously really big. The carne asada was nicely charred and well seasoned, the avocado and sour cream were evenly distributed throughout.What I don't understand about this place is why it takes 15 minutes to make my burrito. I grabbed a taco at La Taqueria right before I came here, and it took about 5 minutes to get and eat my taco. I do see the appeal of coming here after a long night in the Mission, since these burritos are huge and cheap, but if I'm going to lunch somewhere, I'm going to La Taqueria.

I went to El Farolito Restaurant in Mission st not in 24th st but the owner of both resto is the same.I considered as canteen than a restaurant. The place was so tiny and simple like a long hall but if you went there a bit late of eating time, you would find hundred people lining up so you have to come earlier.I ordered Shrimp Burritos and my husband ordered Alpastor Burritos. They are huge burritos and both were super delicious. I could only eat half of it and brought to hotel the other half which I ate for dinner. Surprisingly it was still delicious. The salsa bar is free and soooo goods. We ordered horchata for drink and it was so tasty if you mixed with soda water (mineral sparkling water).We were happy and will come back again today. Hope they don't close for Labor day since we are leaving SF soon. The price is inexpensive and fit for every travelers. But if you are freak with cleanesse do not go there. The resto was messy BUT I still won't mind......

Being a world-traveler, I have sampled Mexican cuisine in many different cities (even Paris). I still find myself lucky to live in the City with its numerous fine taquerias.When I feel like treating myself, I manage to include a trip to Farolito into my schedule. The funny thing is, this place is not expensive at all.I usually get a super burrito with a beer and this is less than $8. The food is fresh and plentiful. The nachos are also a great favorite of mine.There is usually quite a line and the ordering process can be confusing for the uninitiated. You order with the burrito making guys, then wait until you hear your order called (i.e. super asada), then you go pay and claim your food.There are several locations throughout SF. I like the one down on 24th Street towards Harrison too.Really though, most taquerias in San Francisco make great burritos et al., so it is hard to go wrong.

Cheap, fast, authentic. We had 8 tacos (pork and beef). You can eat nachos with salsa while you wait (which isn't long). In the Mission district right off the BART.

Not in the best of areas (or at least at night) but the food was worth it. Close to the BART as well. Prices were very reasonable in relation to the portion size. Food was ready fast as well. An overall can't be beat deal.

We headed off to the Mission district to find a burrito. While riding the Muni down 24th, we met a gentleman who said that El Farolito was the place to go. So that is where we went.You know when a place is good, by the line heading out the door. We managed to snag the last table and enjoyed the salsa and chips while the burrito was being made. The burrito was fantastic! The line never went away the whole time we were there.Next time we will take the Bart station as the station is right next door.

One of the best Taquerias in San Francisco

I personally love the Regular Grilled Chicken Burrito with Black Beans and Avocado.Their grilled chicken is so tender that in my opinion you don't even need sour cream or cheese. Also they have delicious salsa.

Located less than a block from the Mission and 24th Bart (underground transport) station, this humble taqueria is a yellow and red becon of delicious San Francisco style tacos, burritos, and other Mission style offerings. Several tables are available for the weary tourist or you can take your tortilla-wrapped treasures to go. I had the carne asada burrito, with smoky delicious edges to the freshly grilled steak, which paired well with the delightfully sweet horchata.The prices are reasonable, and the burritos are enough for two people. Tortilla chips and salsa are included with your order (at least of the burritos and mains). Easy access via the Bart station was also a big plus for this visitor sans car. Recommended for anyone visiting the city, particularly if you want something convenient, reasonably priced, colourful, and fun.

Great little place for fresh home cooked burritos, tacos quesadillas &amp; more. The food is cooked fresh while you wait. Dine or take out is up to you. If taking it with you be sure to visit the fresh salsa bar - I recommend the salsa verde (green) salsa! It is a little on the spicy side - but amazing! They also give you fresh made chips and ice cold beers are available with an icy mug complete with fresh squeezed limes! The price is right and the servings are huge. Awesome place with great cuisine. It is frequented by the locals so you know it has to be good!

A friend took me to this gem in the Mission. Everything was tasty, fresh and sooo good. And it won't break the bank. My burrito was so big I could not finish it and had the leftovers the next day for dinner.It's very close to the 24th-mission BART station, so it's easy to get to.

Went to El Farolito on our last night of a great vacation (my wife's first visit to SF). Took two trains and a long walk along 24th Street to get there, and us two hicks were pretty wary by the time we got there. No worries, though- the food was AMAZING!! Huge burritos, wonderful tacos- everything was great (except the flan, which was only so-so). The wife even enjoyed the guac- and she hates avocado!! Do you guys deliver- to Florida??

Delicious! We had the Chile Relleno Burrito suprema, it was amazing and huge! Enough to split. We also shared the carne asada quesadilla suiza. It was equally amazing and the meat was so flavorful. Whats more is the salsa bar! The salsa verde was absolutely delicious.

When visiting San Francisco I never encountered mediocre or bad Mexican food. But, this place was open late night, was inexpensive, gave huge portions, and had delicious nachos. Can't go wrong here.
