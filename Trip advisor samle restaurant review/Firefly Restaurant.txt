Was treated to dinner in Noe Valley and enjoyed the ambience and food. We ordered the daikon radish cakes for appetizer, fried Mary's chicken and rockfish , shrimp and clam with watercress. The fried chicken is really tasty. It comes with mashed potato with gravy, coleslaw and a biscuit.

Firefly has been around for a few decades. It's in a beautiful neighborhood in Noe valley. The service is wonderful and the food is fresh and well thought out. The cuisine ranges from comfort food to seasonal to ethnic curries. A little for everyone I think. Desserts are always my favorite. Must order a few!!

I was very disappointed in my visit to Firefly. I had been there several years ago and really enjoyed it but this time my meal was mediocre at best. the &quot;chicken livers&quot; were actually a chicken liver paste/pate like thing which had almost no flavor of the livers. The tortillas in the enchilada were chewy and over cooked at the ends as if they had been cooked the day before and reheated and the filling was tasteless. My fellow diners did say they enjoyed the brisket and fish. would unfortunately not recommend this place. there are so many better restaurants in SF

A lovely spot in Noe Valley that we have been going to for many years. Went there last evening and was not disappointed. Such attention to detail, passion for each element of the meal. Lots of creative vegetable centric dishes. small menu, carefully crafted. excellent wine selections. Not a budget spot though.Very attentive service

Known for the fried chicken which they regularly run out of on weekends. We were a group of 8 and enjoyed our dinner and time together. Waiters were responsive but not so knowledgeable on the wine selection. Most dishes are on the heavy side so come hungry. Atmosphere is much improved from before with well lighted room and good crowd. Worthy of a group or date night dinner. Enjoy

After the great rating in Tripadvisor, I had very high expectations, perhaps that was why I was so disappointed. The prices suggest fine dining, but the food was mediocre - the type of cuisine I'd expect from a cafe. Overall, ok food and service, but not memorable or special... Especially not for the price.

This is a great neighborhood restaurant!

For dessert, we tried the fromage mousse (excellent) and the chocolate budino (excellent).The service was great and the atmosphere was eclectic yet comfortable.It's worth venturing off the beaten path to eat here.

Well what to make of this place ? It's been there forever and we arrived at 20:15 for a 20:30 table . We sat on a bench in a corridor ( there is a bar but it was laid up for dinner and so not possible to hoover there ) the queue was soon out of the door and super busy and the place was rammed . After a glad of fino sherry and chat we stated to get a little fidgety as its was past 21:00 and they seems unable to move the previous guests off our table . Eventually at 21:15 the manageress intervened and asked them to vacate ( apparently they had been there for over 3 hours so that seems fair ! ) I have to say the service recovery was superb and the wonderful team were genuinely embarrassed - drinks were free , the chef cam to the table with an additional dish to say sorry and they then took the desserts off the bill - thank you for appreciating the time we had waited !The food was solid neighbourhood fare with a big emphasis on Jewish dishes ( well it was the 1st day of Passover ! ) so lots of gefiltre fish chopped liver matzo balls etc . It was interesting but I never found Jewish food that exciting !A good wine list although out Cab Sav was off and they were prepared to give us a better one and split the additional cost !So I loved the team and the service ethic - thought the food was Ok and came away smiling

We love this place and come here every 5 or 6 weeks. We live nearby and its a great neighborhood spot. What is special about the place is that the recipes are timeless, some things stay on the menu for a long time, but always fresh and home made. The perk of this place is the entire restaurant (with tiny exceptions) is gluten free. For me this is excellent. The food is not fussy, its rich, generous portions and always friendly excellent service. I never have to worry about the ingredients as they are always sustainable, local and usually organic, just picked, just delivered etc.

Good quality, friendly, welcoming - absolutely nothing wrong with this place but for me it just misses out on a max score - desserts were paricularly strong. Maybe it was the lighting (a bit dark), or something else less easy to define, but there was n't anything about the place that made me think I really wanted to come back and try other stuff from the menu..

We decided to celebrate my daughter's 28th birthday at Firefly last week and all 4 of us were sooooooo happy we did! Hungry and thirsty we couldn't decide what we wanted, it all sounded amazing, so what do a bunch of girls do when this happens...share!We started with Warm Firefly GF nut &amp; seed bread with seasonal spread, sea scallop cake with white remoulade sauce and tasso, yummy roasted Brussels sprouts with parmesan and truffle oil, and poached Fuyu persimmon with fennel, blue lake beans, spiced almonds and ginger. All were out of this world, but we really loved the Fuyu persimmon fennel salad.As we sipped Sancerre wine from France, we agreed to share 2 entrees, braised boneless short ribs with polenta taragna, carrots, parsnips and crimini mushrooms and the blackened mahi mahi with spaghetti squash mock maque choux, spinach and roasted Yukon gold potato. Both were wonderful, but I really enjoyed the short ribs.Believe it or not, as full as we were, we decided to order one more poached Fuyu persimmon with fennel. Yes, it was that good! One of the main things I look for in a restaurant is innovative and interesting flavor combinations. Firefly certainly didn't let me down!

I have not been here in awhile and what a wonderful experience. The ambiance is very romantic. The noise level was very low so we could talk without a problem. The staff were oh so helpful and let the meal evolve..from jane, the hostess, to the waitress to the folks who cleaned our table between every meal.I do not drink alcohol (my dinner companions had a great grenache that they raved about) and was happy to see Navarro pinot noir grape juice on the menu. We had the warm bread with real butter and a pesto oil alternative that was delicious to start.We loved the Brussel sprouts and the fish was really really tasty. 1/2 of us had the blackened mahi mahi and the other half not blackened and it was fresh and a giant piece and totally perfectly cooked. The fixins were creative and delicious (squash, potatoes and a yummy sauce. You can tell the Chef is a woman, Haley Sausner, who serves good food that has subtle tastes that complement but do not overpower the good food she has picked from the market.It was nice to find this gem and we will go back.

Please save your money and go to another Noe Valley restaurant.Food - Somebody in the kitchen was having a salt parade. The chicken, beef brisket, and cod were insanely salty. Almost to the point of inedible. The arugula salad and butter lettuce salad were forgettable and nothing special. The potstickers were way too greasy and all the oil was overpowering the flavors of the scallops. Apple cobbler was served with ice cream that almost half melted when it came out. To top it all off, my boyfriend found a large piece of plastic in his pear sherbet.Service - With a party of 7, service was pretty attentive with water but the kitchen was painfully show, waiting almost 20-30 minutes in between courses.

we are not vegan but like to eat healthy. This restaurant was recommended by a colleague. I had a special fish. It was delicious but the portion is a bit small, especially compared to usual american dishes. My husband had an organic steak. It was with a special Herb mouse, which made the dish really fresh. Very friendly staff and fast service. It was full house on a wednesday night. I reserved a table over Opentable 2 days before.

Firefly has been in business for 21 years so they must be doing something right.24th street is a kind of very long restaurant row but Firefly stands alone at the less-fertile end of it with pretty houses as it's neighbors. Find parking where you can.It's small and cosy, divided into two rooms. The first as you enter has a bar and an open kitchen where you can watch the chefs who were toddlers when it first opened cook some pretty good food in a calm unhurried way-no pan fires or crashing of broken crockery.A smiling hostess led us up a short set of steps to a second room where we were seated at a long table big enough for 8. A lamp hanging low mid-way divided it into two 4 tops.It's a farm to table kind of place.Although the food was very satisfying as it was going down I wouldn't say it was memorable. Solid with no cause for complaint I'd say. No superlatives but a good dinner.My starter was a bowl of mixed olives ($5)from a local farm followed by a flat iron steak (which was sliced before it arrived) with green beans, Bintje potatoes and braised spring onions with a chimichuri sauce (not a favorite sauce).I recently ate in a small French restaurant in Chicago where after each bite I was babbling &quot;wow, this is the ESSENCE of a green bean&quot; so I can get pretty excited about the cooking of food. That didn't happen in Firefly but I wasn't unhappy with what came to the table. There's VERY GOOD and there's EXCELLENT which is an experience beyond expectations.What was excellent was the sterling service we received. A total of 4 ladies, always watchful, tended to our needs as soon as they became apparent. They watched the rooms like hawks and were quick to react. They also knew the menu inside and out. Our main server was Kristin who enthusiastically answered any menu questions and took the orders.Volume-wise the room stayed below din level but was buzzing on a Thursday night.Solid is good enough in my book. A place I would eat again and businesses can last 21 years the more people say that.I can't tell you what the other 3 at the table ate as I just have the total bill in front of me and I was focused on clearing my plate but I do know that next to me their signature fried chicken was enjoyed although there was some dismay that it was all dark meat.One dessert was ordered and proclaimed &quot;amazing&quot; (A cornmeal crepe) I tried a taste of the corn ice cream and egads it really tasted of corn. Different but it'll never replace vanilla. The menu is certainly eclectic.This salad-&quot; Pole bean, pluot and lollo rosso....&quot; what are these things?No wine was ordered as we had a mix of soft drinks, cocktails and bottled beer in my case (no imports alas, think craft beers-Farmer Jake's Armpit Amber or something like that) Oh- it was Firestone Walker Pivo Pilsner-now you know!Total spend was $226 for 4 including tax.

Playful menu choices!

I would think it is hard to come up with an &quot;American&quot; style Restaurant menu and have it be different than EVERY other one out there...AND Firefly manages to do this extremely well. The choices are creative, playful, and create curiosity. It is important to read every word on the descriptions because you want to pick just the right thing...everything sounded amazing. So, We ordered a bottle of wine, while we discussed our choices. Daughter and I decided to order a bunch of things and share it all. First, the Stoller Pinot Noir was a great wine choice. I highly recommend. We started with the Mayfair salad and bread and spread. Without even having to ask, salad was split in two bowls. Our Waitress was right on. The salad was a great start...it was one of the best with the different ingredients. The bread was very fresh and spread was very good. It was hard to break the pre-cut slices of bread apart tho. Next course was the Pea pancake which was served with greens and ricotta cheese. We also had the radish cakes. I enjoyed the radish cakes. Didn't quite know what to expect on that. It was delish. I am not a fan of peas so I was not overly excited about that one. Daughter enjoyed it more. Finally we split the cornbread pudding (main course). Again it was hard to picture exactly what it was going to be...that was the fun of it!! I loved it. It had all kinds of good stuff that I wouldn't think even goes together and it was amazingly delicious. Beans, greens, broth, cornbread etc. yum and I recommend. We couldn't help but notice all of the other dishes being served around us. The Mexican style corn on the Cobb, fried chicken, fish...I wanted to go to each table with my fork and ask for a taste. Lol. Then, as if we weren't already full...had to get dessert. The crepes with maple filling of some sort served with a berry sauce and ice cream...omg. That is a must!! I was most impressed with our Waitress (wish I knew her name)...she heard me mention my Daughter's birthday and without having to ask, served our crepes with a sparkle candle. That was perfect. in fact, our service was perfect the entire time. All restaurants should be that right on with service. One last thing... I definitely have a new favorite restaurant!

I always enjoy Firefly. Most recently had the fried chicken -- not just on Tuesdays anymore!! Also tasted my friend's trout which was also amazing. And the mexican corn as a starter was very tasty. And the bread pudding was amazing... usually huge and heavy at most restaurants, but this was a smaller/better portion size and really delicious made with brioche bread.I'll also mention that their corkage fee is now $20 and they no longer waive corkage if you order another bottle... certainly not a dealbreaker, but a not-so-great change in policy.

Left Us Wanting
Rating: 2
Date: June 1, 2015

This restaurant was picked by others primarily because of the semi vegetarian menu. I personally don't mind a vegetarian fare but this menu was a challenge to find an appealing item. i finally settled on a chicken and vegetable dish that left me wanting. Spartan portions, unmemorable vegetable accompanied the plate. Chicken in a light sauce that was a bit tough and not very flavored. Others I noted had similar dishes but they too looked equally unimaginative. One bottle of moderately priced wine added to the bill for 4. The exit bill was $278!!!! I also found the place extremely crowded (I wondered how that could be) and noisy. Too noisy to carry on any decent conversation. Ambiance was also unmemorable.

I went with 3 friends on a Friday night. The place is small, crowded, but very pleasant. We were happy with the service. For appetizers, we ordered goat cheese souffle, fava and sweat pea pancakes, sweet potato tostones, and they were all wonderful.After that great start, we were looking forward to the entrees. The beef ribs, trout and port chops were all pretty good, particularly the trout's crispy black rice cakes and curry sauce, but the lentils and artichokes were a huge disappointment. They were plain black lentils with some cooked artichokes. I felt like I was eating bland gruel. I was about to order something, anything, else, when one of my friends offered to switch her trout for my lentils. She didn't think the lentils were that great either, but was able to eat them.We then moved onto desserts. We had the tapioca, cheesecake and meyer lemon ice cream. All were good, but not stuff we would order again.All in all, it was disappointing.

Loved my Daikon Cake appetizer and delicious pork entree. I visited with 4 other friends. I loved that they had had aaPassover menu the previous week. We were all quite pleased with the current menu, wine and food but we all had the feeling that the waiter felt he was doing us a favor by attending to us. It may have been that we were seated near the back where the wait staff seemed to congregate behind a screen but it was obvious enough that it became a subject for discussion during the meal. That shouldn't happen. Just one smile would have been nice.

I'm gluten free - not by choice, by body. That makes finding restaurants difficult at best to navigate when trying to find something marginally edible but more difficult to food that is restaurant quality (good). Firefly is amazing! They've got it all together and whenever I'm in the City I stop in. Tuesday night is their famous Gluten-free Fried Chicken dinner. I've turned so many of my colleagues onto the fried chicken at Firefly reservations are necessary. But any night one can find something great to eat, and the wait staff waits. They do a great job. Check Firefly out!

Sadly, as a visitor to SF, I probably won't get to come back here. I went with a local who lives nearby (slogging up endless hills to get there). The atmosphere was immediately apparent. It was crowded and we had to wait a while since our seats weren't ready. We were kept informed during the wait, which is an indication of the service here. We eventually got a table and service was prompt and friendly. Good but not extensive choice of main courses. I picked the meatloaf and my friend had lamb. Both served without too much delay and both delicious. Nice wine selection and not overly expensive.

We were a pretty diverse group of vegetarians, carnivores, ages and nationalities looking for dinner at a location that would suit everyone and allow for conversation. This was well chosen. Firefly had great service, a diverse innovative menu and was really nice for conversation. The rooms are the right size. The spread with the bread was very fun and the wine menu was reasonable. The food was just okay - I think we were all hoping for a bit more. The fried chicken was very average. Parking is a pain, so it is unlikely we would return. However, it is a nice setting for a quietish dinner with family and friends.

Went to this close-in neighborhood to visit old friends and walked to this neighborhood favorite. Reservations a must even on an early Monday night. I liked the menu and loved the salads and entrees I tried: very fresh ingredients, well prepared. I had a vegetarian dish of miso eggplant with brown rice, long beans and pardon peppers--could have been ordinary but it was moist and delicious. I traded with my husband and tried his halibut in a light tomato w/beans broth. Very well seasoned and perfectly fresh,cooked fish. Service was very professional yet casual and staff understood not to interrupt while we were talking; they would return to the table a few minutes later. That type of 'service' is surprisingly unusual in a restaurant but much appreciated! I also liked that the ceiling had a beautiful tented fabric treatment in both adjoining rooms which helped make dinner conversation very audible while still giving a nice 'buzz' to the room. I would definitely return.

I've been to Firefly twice, most recently in February 2014, with a friend who lives in Noe. It's one of his favorites, and I know why! As with the previous visit, the food was excellent and so was the service. A very good value for SF, I think. And they even gave us a loaf of bread to take home at the end of the evening!It's popular, so definitely recommend reservations.

Noe/Castro Staple

We dined at Firefly at the recommendation of a Noe Valley restaurant that was too crowded to seat us. It is just at the border of the Noe Valley and Castro neighborhoods. Their dining room was equally crowded but the host shuffled some folks at the bar and managed to seat the 3 of us there. My girlfriend and I love eating at a restaurant bar because you usually enjoy more banter with a bartender than a waiter and you get a nice, elevated view of the dining room. The menu is brief and eclectic. I can't stand a phone book menu like most chain restaurants have. I want fresh rotated stock in the kitchen. I had the sea bass (cooked to moist, flaky perfection) and my son had a vegan dish. My girlfriend combined an appetizer with a salad. All dishes were creative and balanced and our plates were left bare. Seated at the bar we also had a prime view of the kitchen where the chef was a young, twenty-something female. All the staff work very well together. No yelling, no stressing, a nice orchestra of cooperation. The ceilings are very high with a parachute draped from above. I would recommend an upgrade on the sparse and drab paintings on the wall.

I love Firefly, but as some of the reviewers have mentioned, they occasionally have an off night and you walk away a little disappointed.First off, Tuesdays is usually fried chicken day (standard American fare --- potatoes, gravy, biscuit with honey)....I have had it three times in the past 7 months (including my most recent visit last Sunday...yes, it was not Tuesday and so I was also surprised they were serving it) and I have to say, when they do it right, it is the best anywhere. Unfortunately, one of the three visits the fried chicken was over-done (a little dry for my taste).The rest of the menu is also great, and almost never disappoints. I have tried the fish several times and it has always been cooked to perfection....but getting back to my visit last week.From Sunday through Thursday, Firefly offers a fixed-price menu; about $38 for an appetizer, main meal, and dessert. Basically, you are getting a dessert for about $2 or $3 in you went al a carte. The meal starts off with bread and a home made spread; the bread is excellent and the spread is always interesting (and different every time I visit --- this night the dip was made with garbanzo beans and a variety of spices - yummy). Then came the appetizer; I ordered a &quot;gem lettuce salad&quot; --- excellent; and as I indicated (and discussed) above, I ordered the fried chicken, which was perfect. My companion ordered the fish (also perfect). Then came desserts....honestly...this is not their strong suit; it is my understanding that they subcontract the desserts; but they should think about getting someone else --- dessert (this time it was up-side down cake), was nice but a little let down after such a great meal.Finished off with tea --- excellent.Some other comments about the restaurant --- they have bar seating (first come first serve) in case you did not make your reservations far enough in advance and want to drop in; they also have &quot;fireflies&quot; (flashing lights) in the restaurant....your kids will like it.Some other comments about the menu --- there is always a vegetarian menu available, and on Jewish holidays they emphasize &quot;Jewish&quot; food items.

What a delightful restaurant with an eclectic blend of menu choices. My local friends brought me here, and I was not disappointed.Started the meal with a French aperitif wine: Lillet. Then shrimp and sea scallop potstickers that were melt in your mouth delicious. The baby gem salad looked delicious and fresh. My friend let me sample a bite from her trout dish with coconut creamed corn and it was fantastic.I ordered the Roasted Mary's Chicken with jambalya and herb swamp greens. The chef magically captured the Cajun spices of New Orleans without overburdening the tongue with spicy hot herbs.Dessert was ordered - Apricot Raspberry Tart, and the Chocolate mouse cake. I would have been in heaven with either of these options, and grateful for a my guests who believed in sharing!The waitstaff was friendly, made suggestions, and even let me take a menu home with me so I could rave about this place to my friends.Make reservations to guarantee a seat.

The location is great -- right at the end of the shopping strip on 24th street in Noe Valley. The dining room is rustic chic; not pretentious, but neutral tones, dim lighting, and comfortable. Significantly overpriced in the end. I say that because it wasn't cheap, and I don't remember much about the meal, apart from an unoriginal kale salad. Nothing truly memorably bad either, though. There are other better places on 24th.

This place has been in business for 20 years - and there's a reason it's still going strong. The menu is as diverse as the City itself - and there are usually one or two fish entrees and one or two vegetarian entrees also. The appetizers are excellent, although my personal favorites are the pot stickers with wonderful flavors of shrimp and scallop, moistened perfectly in a tangy sesame soy dipping sauce.During the week, they offer a 3-course prix fix menu for $38 which is really worth it (unlike many restaurants in SF.) I've been here to celebrate birthdays, valentines day, Passover, and other occasions - you cannot go wrong in here.

This is a very nice, small restaraunt that serves food that is definitely not your run of the mill with vegetarian options and more healthy options. The brussel sprouts were ver good and I enjoyed my fish very much. It has a relaxed, intimate atmosphere and the wait staff was very riendly and attentive. While the meals were good they were not exceptional and they were on the high side of moderate. With all of the really great options and San Francisco, this would not be on the top of my list but it was good.

The service is relaxed and friendly, the food incredible and the atmosphere is warm and intimate.We shared several appetizers for our group of seven; it was easy to explain what we wanted and get help in determining how much we would need for the table. The main courses were just as good, including vegetarian options. Again dessert was shared. Cannot recommend more highly!

Great Food in a Low Key Atmosphere

The food at Firefly is really good, but the low key nature of the place, its neighborhood feel and it's comfort approach to food makes it very different from the hundreds of hipster restaurants in the city.We were seated at our reservation time (a decided rarity in the city) and immediately supplied menus and delicious warm bread accompanied by a split pea and fennel spread-great. We started off with the shrimp and sea scallop potstickers, which were excellent. Another person in our party had the quinoa fritters with coriander; she rated them good. For a main course I had the turkey with a tamale as good as those I've had in Mexico, with red mole sauce, accompanied by black beans, roasted squash and pepitas-moist turkey and everything else was first rate. The vegetarian in the group had the Celery Root and Cauliflower Gratine with hen of the woods mushrooms and brussels sprout leaves; she found the entire dish to be fresh, clean and very flavorful. For dessert we selected a &quot;deconstructed&quot; (my term, not the restaurants) pumpkin brioche bread pudding with toffee sauce and rum cream anglaise and quince- it was outstanding- sweet, with the all the flavors coming together really well and rich enough that it satisfied three of us. The wine list is fine and we had some good reds by the glass at reasonable prices. Service was excellent; we were never rushed and the spacing of courses was perfect. Although well off the typical tourist beaten track (which is a tremendous plus in restaurant crazy San Francisco) , Firefly is worth the journey for excellent food in a warm and welcoming environment.

As it happened, I ended up eating at Firefly two nights in a row since friends recommended it the first night and I was taken as a guest by other friends who wanted to try it the second.What I will tell you is this. The room(s) are small and charming. There is very little of the San Francisco pretense that pervades so many of the good restaurants in this city. People were friendly. We were seated both nights quite punctually at the times of our reservations and in both cases the hosts, servers and bussers (who do a bit more than a typical busser does) were really delightful to deal with. Our waitress Sarah on the first night was so friendly and helpful we were tempted to ask her to join us, and I will tell you that never happens.Prices are, for San Francisco, reasonable and the wine list, while not huge, is ample and very very fairly priced by the standards of this city and its often grotesquely over-inflated wine prices. Many restaurants price their entrees in the low to mid $20 range but then nail you to the cross on wine. Firefly does not.The food was generally quite good although the standout was the simple but wonderful roast chicken. This is a dish that many places do a pretty good job of but Firefly does it superbly. I would put it in a class with the one from Zuni Cafe but you don't wait as long or pay as much.Portions are ample so don't over order. They have a very reasonable 3 course prix fixe option for $38 which a couple of us did the first night. You don't have to commit to this, but if you have room for dessert it is a hell of a deal.Don't go expecting a meal like you would get at Boulevard or Jardinierre but then the bill will be half or less than what you would have spent at those two. I put Firefly almost in the class of Sociale. . .really wonderful unpretentious neighborhood haunts that simply will not disappoint and won't leave you feeling like you just spend a quarter of your monthly income.Try it. You'll like it.

This is the kind of place San Francisco is so well known for: a truly well-prepared, innovative food selection at extremely good prices. Their week day three course fixed price for three courses is a true bargain. And their Tuesday evening fried chicken is to-die-for good. An occasional but extremely rare off note is more than made up for by the attentive staff, fine food, and reasonably priced wines by the glass.You don't have to spend a fortune in SFO to get a great meal.

Firefly is a warm, fun little restaurant in the upper Noe Valley. The service was very good, personable without being cloying, and helpful with wine selection. The bus service (often times where service fails) was perfect.Our salads were the best we have had during our 6 week road trip in the USA. The chef really makes his salads sing, and his treatment of all vegetables was creative and deft. We ordered the sherry braised pork shoulder and the Rocky Chicken, and both were delicious.Our visit was on a Tuesday night, and I called at 7pm for a 7:30 table. No problem.Give Firefly a try.

Make reservations at least a week ahead of time-this place is popular! Wow-every morsal of the meal was amazing, succulent, delicious! We tried to get into this place because my friends were honoring Passover, and this restaurant has meals such as Matza Ball Soup, Gefilte Fish, etc. it was difficult to get a table, but they called us when there was a last minute cancellation. The ONLY reason that I gave it 4 stars overall, was bc it's pretty pricey. But I'm not from CA, and am told this is typical. Otherwise, as far as service, food quality, and atmosphere, I highly recommend it! The lamb and Mahi are delicious.Bon Appetit!

Firefly used to be one of my favorite restaurants in the city but a recent visit was really disappointing. We went on Tuesday, which is the day that they serve their famous fried chicken. I remember when I first had it years ago, it was the best fried chicken I've ever had. But this time, it was dry and overcooked. The flavor wasn't as great as it used to be. The appetizer was kind of bad, too. (We ordered shrimp and scallop pot stickers and it wasn't good.)What happened? Please bring back the old Firefly that used to serve amazing Fried Chicken...

We went on a Monday night without reservations which apparently was a Mistake. Host gave us &quot;the eye&quot; and sat us at the bar- despite the fact that the restaurant was nearly empty- and there were still open tables when we left. I was there with 2 friends, and my dish (a fish &amp; clam stew) was very good, as was one friend's gnocchi. However my other friend's tuna was dry and plain. Biggest complaint though- when we were ready to leave, we asked the bar tender to break up our check into separate checks- well you would have thought we asked him to saw off his limbs! Lots of sighing and excuses ('that will REALLY take me a long time', etc.) Overall i would say- make sure you get a reservation &amp; ask for recommendations on the menu.

I've been enjoying Firefly for years, and of course the food is excellent (it's San Francisco, after all) and I've had the fried chicken countless times. But what has always made the place stand out is the people there who serve you. They all seem to be happy to be there, with each other and with you, the customer. And it ends up making me happy just to be there.

I like the added touch of the cute &quot;firely jar&quot; and the whole &quot;romantic&quot; ambiance without being over the top. The best seafood (Shrimp and scallops) potstickers I've ever had in my life...My husband had the Pork Belly with applesauce - wow, amazing... you just have to try it, can't explain the different flavors...Pros:- All the above- Quaint and trendy, it felt as if I was in a small resteraunt in France or ItalyCons:- A little bit pricey, but hey, you're in SF and you get what you pay for (we appreciate the details that go into making those twist on typical food)

An interesting menu with some creative items. Who would expect a signature dish of &quot;fried chicken&quot; within such a sophisticated menu, yet it's worth coming on a Tuesday to enjoy such a tasty item, crispy outside yet succulent inside (and I'm from Georgia so I know good fried chicken). Moreover, the fixed price offering Sunday through Thursday of any appetizer, entree, and dessert for $37 cannot be beat. All of the seafood ingredients are sustainable and all of the meats are hormone- and antibiotic-free. This is truly a San Francisco treat. Any negatives? Difficult street parking but be patient till something opens up and then show courtesy to the neighbors who need to enter/leave their garages. Well worth the effort.

This is a local spot, where you will find comfort food that is seasonal as well as a cozy and intimate atmosphere for a great meal. It is is a residential neighborhood (Noe Valley), and parking may be an issue (hello - this is SF), and reservations are recommended unless you are like me and choose the bar seating. I was impressed with the service, including how they perfectly timed our dishes. Everything from appetizer, to main and dessert were amazing. I want to go back for their Fried Chicken Night on Tuesdays. I also liked their wine list which had a good amount of reasonably priced bottles.how they have lavender soap in bathroom too.

We headed here on a Thursday night. We did the 3 course pre fixe for $36.00. i had the roasted brussel sprouts and white truffle oil, the poached cod, and the bruleed dessert (maple was in the name). My date had the salad with juniper buttermilk dressing, the pork chop, and same dessert. We finished with cappuccinos.My date really liked her salad but i tasted it and founded it &quot;meh&quot;. I really liked the roasted brussel sprouts a lot. And the portion size was huge! I mean: huge! Ditto for her salad.I liked the poached cod but would have prefered pan roasted or baked fish much more. I had never had cod poached before and am not sure I would again. The texture is ...well...slimy. And slimy shouldn't be a texture associated with fish -- not in my book. But the flavors worked well.My date liked her pork and I tasted it. It was terrific. The hoarseradish spaezle was a nice touch too -- on the side.We both loved the dessert. We were gonna go with the lemon tart but the waitress guided us to the bruleed dessert and we were so happy she did.Our waitress was absolutely lovely, caring, and friendly. She recommended dishes, upon request, and also recommended wine pairings. She even called us a taxi after our meal. She really made our evening.Saw lots of tables of friends just having a nice mid-week dinner together. Really nice cozy atmosphere and lots of people enjoying their meals.I'd definitely go back. If not for the texture of the poached fish, this place easily would get 5 stars.

On a recent trip so San Francisco, I had the unexpected pleasure of dining at Firefly with some local friends. The menu was small, yet the options so delightful you didn't need anything else. They use a rotating menu, but the week we were there offered Swordfish, Salmon, Duck and of course Steak, in addition to two vegetarian plates. I had the duck, and delectable is all I have to say. The pot-stickers, which are the only thing they keep on the menu weekly, made for a great appetizer. Will be back upon my next trip to the bay!

My wife, her friend and I were served by Adam, who did an excellent job and answered all our questions, and recommended the dishes that made up for a dinner to remember.Don't miss the best Fried Chicken you will ever have. Also, the pot stickers were a testament to the culinary creativity of this place.

This restaurant is in Noe Valley and is very charming on the outside. Inside it's warm and welcoming. There's a nice wooden bar under warm lighting with very good wine. We had a table for six that was creatively separated from the rest of the long table by a large vase. As an appetizer, we ordered the restaurant's well known brussels sprouts which were absolutely divine. If you love brussels sprouts already, you'll think you've died and gone to heaven after you eat these. But if you don't like b. sprouts to begin with, you will after you eat these. I also had the Roasted Butternut Squash and Pear Soup...a very creatively delicious soup.My entree was the pistachio stuffed sole. Living on the california coast and having eaten sole my entire life, this was hands down the best sole I have EVER had. Each bite melted in my mouth. It came with delicious celery root which I'd never had but one of my friends said that it was prepared in the best way they'd ever tasted. Three of the people in my group had the grilled pork porterhouse and all agreed it was wonderful.On to dessert: we shared the Caramelized Maple Pain Perdu with Spiced Apples and Candied Pecans. I like desserts but rarely love them....this one I LOVED. Once again, one of the most delicious, melt-in-you-mouth desserts I've ever had. Not too sweet, not too heavy...AMAZING!I've eaten at quite a few nice restaurants in the last year and always had a good meal but not a great meal. But Firefly is truly a treat for your palate..,the BEST I've had in a long time.

My first meal here in March was one of the best dining experiences I've had in SF (appetizer, entree, dessert). I guess you can't go home again. I came back in June and found the meal a bit less impressive (a rather lack-luster roasted bean appetizer and a less than inspired vegetarian entree, saved only by an excellent chocolatedessert).

Thank You Trip Advisor and Firefly

Everything at Firefly was different--and I mean that in the best possible way! From downtown SF where we were staying for our anniversary, we took a streetcar and a bus to Noe Valley (of course a taxi ride would be easier, but we enjoyed the adventure). The food was nothing short of amazing--she had beef and I had pork, but prepared in ways and with flavors that made them entirely new experiences. The creme fraiche desert was to die for--don't miss it! Even the coffee and rooibos tea were unique. Our waitress had very helpful recommendations, and the service was relaxed and friendly (not rushing us at all). If you want to linger, get a table. If you have less time to spare, sit at the bar. It was the perfect casual-romantic setting for our anniversary. Thanks to Trip Advisor, we felt like we discovered a hidden gem and ate like &quot;in the know&quot; locals!

Even better the second time!!!

A friend who lived there took me to Firefly on my last night in San Fran when I was there in 2004, and when I went back out to San Fran with my boyfriend last week as part of a larger West cost trip, I decided to surprise him with an early birthday dinner there. I called ahead and gave special instructions for how to bring out dessert, and they followed everything to the letter. All through the evening, before he knew it was his birthday dinner, my boyfriend kept raving about everything -- the food, the service, the presentation, the atmosphere...I was so glad he loved it as much as I did. The dessert birthday surprise was just the icing on the cake (no pun intended). If you're going on a Sun-Thurs night the pre-fixe (sp) is a must...a really great value. I live in the metro NYC area and as many great restaurants as we have here, I cannot say that there is one that matches the combination of great food, ambiance, value, and atmosphere that Firefly has. It's located all the way across town, away from the downtown and more popular San Fran districts...and in my opinion that adds to its charm as a &quot;best kept secret.&quot; However this is a secret that needs to be leaked. Go there, go back, and tell a friend!

I was really impressed with Firefly. I had read that it was a local favorite and decided to make it a priority on our trip to San Francisco. We went on a weekday and took advantage of the $30 prix fixe. I had a delicious 5 Spice Seared Ahi Tuna Napoleonic Salad as an appetizer, Grilled Mahimahi Filet with Griddled Plantain Green Chile Cakes for dinner and an amazing Warm Pear Ginger Hand Pie with Fromage Blanc Ice Cream for dessert. The food was delicious, unique, and just the right amount. This place is a must!
