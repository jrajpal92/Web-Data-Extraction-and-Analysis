Stopped in for a quick lunch. Say at the bar. Had the sashimi tasting and miso soup. Fish was very fresh, but not very interesting. I guess that I was expecting more from the &quot;tasting&quot; than plane old sashimi. Had to ask for the miso soup three times ... Chef was too busy trying to impress the guys sitting next to me than giving me any attention. They comped me miso though.

This place is tiny but the sushi is delicious, you can tell the fish is very fresh, and it's mainly classic sushi, not a lot of crazy silly Americanized rolls. The eggplant appetizer was also very tasty.

Attended the restaurant for dinner this evening, had some trouble finding the restaurant due to lack of external signage.Ordered Salmon sashimi - the wasabi tasted freshly ground, was fragrant and with good heat. The ginger, shiso and daikon were fresh and tasted great. The sake salmon was cut adequately but still had a layer of the brownish-grey flesh which is unacceptable. Quality of the fish was good, although Scottish sourced salmon has a far superior flavour.Miso was good, temperature was just right to enjoy immediately.Spider roll was good, could have done with a little more wasabi, but was tasty.Fried squid was excellent, good taste and texture, not overly dressed or spiced.Tempura needs a bit of work, prawns were good the vegetables though were a bit of a miss. Each piece of tempura should be able to be finished in a couple of bites (three at a maximum), the pieces served were way too large. Smaller pieces are easier to eat and carry the batter and ponzu better. Selection of veg was a bit overly starchy, needed more lighter vegetables and maybe a battered shiso leaf.The black cod came last and was dressed with salmon roe and what tasted like cheese. This was a huge mistake. The cod on its own was perfectly cooked and flavoured and needed nothing extra at all, the topping only served to detract from what was an excellently cooked piece of fish.Overall it was an enjoyable meal, but I found the aspects noted above frustrating. There is no doubting the skill of the chefs, it just needs a bit of tidying up to become great.

From the outside it was not recognisable as a restaurant, we walked in for lunch, without reservation, we were lucky to get a table in this busy restaurant.

Incredible pedigree of chefs behind the counter, including the owner/operator, Ray. Their menus are curated daily to account for the best available fish coming in from Japan et al. Akiko's has created a great balance between traditional preparation and innovative techniques, definitely a must-try if you can snag a seat.

I had no reservations and got there when they opened at 5:30. The hostess kindly told me they would need my seat at 7pm! I had the chef select my sashimi piece by piece it was served to me. Amazing! One pieces was better than the next. Great experience. I loved it!

We did a lot of research in advance on where to go for good sushi before we came to S.F. and we decided to go to Akikos. We made the reservation like one week before our trip and thank God we did. Everyone walked in to the restaurants that night were kindly declined by the hostess before it was fully booked. It is a small/medium size restaurant with a sushi counter sits about 8. We requested to sit at the counter so we can see all the action. All the sushi chefs are Americans. In the beginning, we had some doubts to be honest. Don't get me wrong, no one says sushi chefs have to be Japanese but you just kind of expected one to stand behind the counter. Once we started our order and saw how focus the chef was, we were so impressed. Not only the fishes were fresh, chef improvised some interesting pieces for us too. Sushi we had was amazing. Few tips for coming to this restaurant: 1) Make reservation ahead of time. 2) There is no valet parking. And it's not easy to find street parking in SF so allow enough time to find parking or call Uber. 3) There is no eye-catching restaurant sign at the front door. Easy to miss so pay attention. 4) Finally, just enjoy the sushi :)

A group of five of us on a business trip from various parts of the country meant here to have sushi at about 12:30 on a Friday afternoon. The restaurant was not especially full and there were plenty of seats at the bar and several tables open. We were immediately greeted by a man who asked if we had reservations. We told him that we did not and when he asked how big our party was and we said '5', he immediately said that he could not serve us or help us. When we asked why, he said that he could not even split up our table or else he would be fired. This seemed rather odd to us so I offered to sit at the bar while my four colleagues ate at a table. He said this would not be acceptable and that we should go somewhere else. He attempted to refer us to a restaurant called 'Okuma' which he said would be approximately a $6 Uber ride away. When we asked again if we could split into a table of three or two with separate checks he said 'no' and that he would be fired. This is quite possibly the most bizarre situation I have ever encountered from a maitre d' at any restaurant anywhere I have travelled. It almost seemed discriminatory and we simply all turned around and left the restaurant and found another sushi place approximately two blocks away which I will review later. Even though we did not try the food, the way the situation was handled was less than acceptable. Another restaurant received our $250 check.

I was looking for a good little restaurant in the Union Square area and this place was perfect. It is very quaint with only 4 tables and 3 spots at the sushi bar so I was lucky to get a table right before a bunch of other people showed up. The service was great and the food even better! I got a sushi combination of San Francisco maki and sake maki which came with miso soup and a pickled cabbage salad. The soup was great and the pickled cabbage salad had some really tasty spice. Great salad. The maki was some of the best I've ever had. If you can get a table at this place, take it and enjoy!

Went here on a recommendation on a work trip. The sushi was fresh and there was options on the menu for a lot of complexity and a lot of simplicity. It was accommodating for the folks in our party.

But the food was great and we would come back again.

I've been here a few times for lunch, and the food is terrific. The sushi is priced a bit on the higher side, but they have good lunch options. The sushi is very fresh, and it's priced a bit higher than I would have expected. The lunch options are limited, but very enjoyable. I'd recommend it. Service was very good the first few times and a bit lame (condescending) the last time we were there.

Very popular location - but no signage. (You have to know where you are going. Reservations are a must) No bar to sit while waiting for your table. Omakase/chef's selections were delicious, but not mindblowing. Was expecting more, frankly. Nothing wrong with our meal, though - the hype just raised our expectations to a level that was not met.

The sushi here is quite good, but we were turned off by the server's attitude. Upon taking our drink order my wife asked for a coke (the menu offered &quot;soda&quot;) to which he replied &quot;Oh, we don't have that, but I think the owner bought a few cans for the kids, let me see if I can find you one&quot;. We didn't say anything but I think he sensed that we were a bit taken aback by his response. I'm not sure if we rubbed him the wrong way, or that he felt we were beneath him, but he passed us off to another server who was clearly more amiable. The meal itself was all very good and the sushi was fresh, however I did find a piece of &quot;gristle&quot; in one of nigri morsels - not great for a place that wants to be known as one of the best in the city.

I can't add much to the 5 star reviews below. This is our favorite restaurant in SF. Make a reservation. This place is small and they stagger reservations so as not to overwhelm the chef, much to diners' advantage. We like to follow advice from the knowledgable waiters. The specials at dinner are fish/preparations that are not usual items on sushi menus; they are pricey but well worth it! And if you love uni you can compare CA, Japanese and Russian sources.

Akiko's raises the bar for sushi in San Francisco.At Akiko's, the only way to go is to sit at the sushi bar and do omakase. Chef Ricky will take you on a magical mystery tour of fishes you never knew you loved. Over a period of at least two hours you will enjoy an endless series of fish and vegetables complemented by various innovative sauces. You will be treated to an array of temperatures, textures, and cooking methods--all of which are awesome. Don't hesitate; just do it.While the rolls are good, at Akiko's you should head straight for the sashimi and nigiri. The monkfish liver is sublime. Don't miss it. If you think you do not like urchin, try the Russian uni. Its delicate, creamy taste will change your mind about spiny sea creatures. Rich and delicious, the keiji salmon has a higher fat content than toro and shouldn't be missed. Toro (tuna), hamachi (yellowtail), unagi (grilled freshwater eel), saba (mackerel), sake (salmon), hotate (scallop)--all the fish is of the highest quality, perfectly prepared, and artistically presented.Service is hit and miss. The sushi chefs are great, but, while friendly and informative, the wait staff assigned to use would sometimes disappear for long periods of time.Tips:- Make a reservation; do not try to walk in, as you will be disappointed- Skip the crowded dining room with its closely spaced tables; sushi bar all the way- Bring your gold Amex; the prices reflect the quality of the fishOverall Akiko's puts out some high quality fish at commensurately high prices.

I have eaten in Sushi restaurants all over the world including Tokyo and there is not one that comes close to the quality, freshness, and ingredient profile of Akiko. I got lucky when it was recommended from one of my friends who lives in SFran, but be warned its a hard table to get so make a reservation in advance.Imagine the most delicious fish fresh from Japan with super talented Sushi Chefs and with a great sake selection. Its a memorable experience.I come here every time I am in town as many times as I can. If you really love sushi and not a novice this is a masterful sushi experience not to be missed.Like all great sushi its not for the budget conscience but for the foodies that can experience perfection you will be glad you found Aikko.

From the outside is not recognizable as a restaurant, so you should know where you should be. Reservations are necessary, even for lunch (at least we had not booked and had to wait an hour until we could have lunch there).The restaurant is very small, especially the back room is very crowded and so noisy (maybe we had some bad luck because there were quite loud guests) that we could barely hear each other, while the tables are still not that great.The sushi and especially the sashimi were delicious, and the sashimi was really one of the best we've ever eaten.The service is efficient and hasty, which is unfortunate because enjoying the food in a relaxed way is, also because of the noise, not possible.We will remind the outstanding sashimi for a long time, but we still will not come back here because the restaurant, despite the high price, does not have a pleasant atmosphere.

The restaurant has no signage outside and no unit number so one can easily miss the restaurant like we did. It is a small restaurant, not more than eleven small tables, along Bush Strret a short distance from Grand Hyatt San Francisco, but it came highly recommended. It has a bar though where one can enjoy the meal watching the chefs prepare the dishes. We were there for late lunch so we were hungry and ordered the set meal which came with a bowl of rice, soup, sushi and tempura, and additional sashimi and california rolls. I must say the sashimi here beats that in Umami as the fish served were excellent in texture and freshness. Our lunch was excellent, every dish we had was really good. I must add that the service was really good too. This is a much underrated restaurant, but it won't be for long I am certain.

We were blown away by the quality and variety of fishes we had here! The menu was quite large and we couldn't decide what to order because every single item sounds so exciting, so we had the Omakase. We let the chef choose what we ate, and it was THE BEST! The fishes was so fresh they tasted as if they were just caught! The preparations were outstanding! The food just kept coming until we told the waiter we were full. I think we had some 15 kinds of fishes, scallops, etc. It is a top-notch operation.

The best thing about Akiko's is that they really have superb quality fish, probably some of the best sushi I've had outside Japan. The selection of fish is also much more extensive than your average sushi restaurant, with special cuts. For example, they offer salmon belly which was very tasty. Once you realize how good this fish is at Akiko's, it's hard to stop ordering, so I ran up a substantial bill, but it was worth it! I was traveling solo for business and sat at the counter, it's important to reserve ahead if you're planning to eat before 8:00. The stools had carved seats that were quite comfortable, nice job whoever made these. Service was good in general, sushi is ordered directly from the chef behind the counter. Japanese beer is all 20 oz. bottles, nice touch. Highly recommended, especially if you are into good fish.

Our uni was wonderful and generous. The service was great. Our wine paired well with our meal. We will return.This restaurant at 431 Bush has no sign and is a little hard to find because of that, but trust the address. It is not related to another restaurant by the same name that closer to Union Square.

if you are going at the prime lunch or dinner time, it's best to have a reservation since this is very small restaurant. BUT definitely worth going and waiting if you can't make reservation. you can entertain yourself by walking around Chinatown while you wait for table (recommend visiting Ital Tealeaf for tea tasting on Grant st).We had agadashi tofu, white belly tuna sashimi and several rolls of which Tekka was by far the best, however, everything was extremely fresh and tasty. The sashimi simply melts in your mouth. There is extensive sake selection, we personally love the Asahi extra dry with Japanese food. The service was equal to the high quality of food offered.

I made a reservation for one approximately two hours before lunch time because of other reviews. I was greeted and seated by two very nice hostesses. I saw many people turned away because there was literally no room and they didn't have reservations. The place is small - I would think it can only seat about 40-50 people. I had a nigiri 6 piece sample and the Maki specialty roll with a Pinot noir. The presentation was flawless and food very good. I commented to the sushi chef that one of my pieces seemed &quot;fishy&quot; - I didn't mean it was spoiled or bad, it was just not my favorite. He replaced it with a striped sea bass that was perfect. This was a recommendation from a &quot;local&quot; of where to find good sushi. It's slightly tucked away off Union Square, but I would highly recommend.

We have eaten at several excellent sushi restaurants in the Bay Area and believe this small restaurant, with no signage out front, may be the best. Whether our order is an appetizer (the fried soft-shell crab is a favorite), sashimi (the black tuna is a &quot;game changer&quot;), or a sushi roll (the Forty-Niner and Sake are outstanding), we know we will receive consistently fresh, creative and delicious dishes. The wait-staff is efficient and helpful, ready to answer our questions or offer suggestions. The extensive sake list is remarkable. If there is a weakness at this restaurant it is their lack of wine selections but you are encouraged to bring your own bottle if you desire. This has always been a favorite with both our out-of-town guests and our SF friends. We have never been disappointed. With the small number of tables and limited seating, make reservations because this is a popular place for locals and SF financial district workers.

I went to Akikos alone for lunch and sat at the sushi bar. I got the sushi sampler, and it everything was very fresh and delicious. Because I was alone, I amused myself by watching the chefs making all of the dishes, and their attention to detail was amazing. They used tweezers to place individual sprouts of micro greens just so on salads, sprinkled just the right amount of some kind of seasoning on a sushi roll, and adjusted fish on plates so it looked beautiful. The care taken with all of the food really showed.I did not have any of the trouble with not-so-nice staff or finding the restaurant that other reviewers have mentioned. In fact, everyone at Akikos was very nice and attentive to me and the other solo diners around me at the sushi bar. Perhaps it was because I anticipated having trouble locating the restaurant that I had none. There is no outside sign, but it is clearly marked with the street number, and it showed up on google maps.The only downside of my meal was that it was fairly expensive ($50 plus tip), particularly for a lunch. If I lived in San Francisco, I wouldn't be able to go here often or even regularly, but when I could afford a special treat, I would definitely return.

We wanted an early dinner but had to wait until they opened at 5. There were several other people waiting as well who told us this was the best sushi place around. However, I didn't think it was nearly as good as Marina Sushi where we had eaten two days before. Akiko was pretty average to me, and I did not see what the fuss was about. Prices were much higher than Marina as well.

I was in San Francisco and had heard about Akikos. I called on a Wednesday and I was unable to get a reservation until Friday and the only reservation they had was either at 5 or 8:45, we took the 8:45. It's true what others have said, it's very small and not marked with a sign. We had to wait 10 minutes even though we were on time for our late reservation. The service was weird, we had about 4 different waiters and all of our items (drinks, soups, sushi, and such) all arrived to our table at the same time after we waited for them for a looooong time. The menu was small but they had a few things I liked. Overall, average experience, nothing special.

While in San Francisco, my husband and I recently had dinner at Akikos. The first thing you need to know is that there is no signage outside the restaurant (it's like a hidden gem!). We made reservations which seem like a must given how few tables the restaurant had. I will say that it was a cool night out, but inside it was hot; uncomfortably hot. Akikos had a nice wine and beer list to choose from (no full bar). The sushi is what we went for though and it did not disappoint! We did a combination of sushi rolls and sashimi which were brought out separately, as they were prepared. The scallop sashimi especially just melted in your mouth; all of the fish were the freshest quality. Overall this was a great place for a nice, relaxing, and romantic sushi dinner that wasn't too expensive either.

I highly recommend the lunch set specials. The salmon teriyaki with 4 piece sashimi is a great deal for this quality and for SF. No sign outside the door so just go uphill from the subway sandwich shop

Melt in your mouth fish! Had the spicy tuna, a vegetarian roll and the 49ers roll. 49ers was unbelievable. The fish could melt in your mouth it was so fresh. Watching the chefs put so much care into everything the prepare is wonderful. My bf will now order something more than chicken teriyaki at a sushi restaurant! Definitely not a tourist trap.

This place was highly rated and I really wanted sushi in San Francisco, so we went here for dinner. Although I'm from the Midwest, I've had my fair share of sushi, good and bad, from small divey places to upscale trendy restaurants. The service was very good, our waiter was very knowledgeable and friendly. The place has a trendy feel, good for a date night. If you like maki rolls, they don't have a very wide selection, so I was a little disappointed with that. However, the rolls we did have were extremely fresh, and very good. My favorite was their spicy tuna, probably one of the best I've had, seriously melt-in-your-mouth good. We also had an unagi roll, which again was very fresh, and tasty. And we shared two pieces of wild king salmon nigiri, which had that same melt-in-your-mouth effect. I would've loved more specialty rolls to choose from, but I was very happy with the overall experience - the taste and quality of what we ordered, the ambiance, and the service. Definitely recommend!

Seriously the best and freshest fish I have ever had. The service was excellent and attentive without being annoying. However, this place should definitely be saved for special occasions because it's pretty expensive. You do get what you pay for. The salmon sashimi literally melted in my mouth. And I have never had better scallops anywhere else!

You may find bigger sushi places in San Francisco. You may find trendier sushi places in San Francisco. You may find hipper restaurants. You will not find a better place with THE FRESHEST sushi and the nicest staff in town. Ask the waiter, Allen, for recommendations and sit back and enjoy. It's not inexpensive, but well worth the price.

The funky neo-warehouse look was fine by us. The menu has plenty and plenty of options. So we asked our waiter to help - let the chef show his best. Overall I'd say this is the place to go if you enjoy the understated style of sushi. No big Wow flavors - nothing that was sizzled or popped. All good and we enjoyed it - and those who enjoy the subtleties of fresh sushi flavors would no doubt enjoy this place a lot.

Illegally treat service dogs, but sushi is good

I love sushi but my husband doesn't, so I asked the concierge at our condo to recommend a sushi restaurant. I entered Akiko's with a small service dog in a sling, fully identified with a vest and a tag. There was an unoccupied.hostess station. After a couple of minutes, the sushi chef closest to the entrance asked me &quot;what do you want?&quot; (Not &quot;can I help you?&quot;, or something courteous.) I said that I wanted to have lunch at the sushi bar. He demanded if I had a reservation, and I said no, I didn't know I needed one. By that time the hostess had arrived, so I told her that I wanted to have lunch and asked when the next reservation at the sushi bar was available. She responded that there was a space immediately available. As she began to show me to the seat, the same sushi chef said &quot;we are very particular about service dogs here - where is your dog's tag?&quot; I showed him her vest and tag, and he aggressively informed me that it wasn't a service dog tag, he personally had a service dog and my dog's tag was invalid. I then offered to show him her ID card and even my letter from my physician - he looked at the ID card, thought for a long time as though he was trying to find a reason not to let me sit down, and finally gave me the card back and allowed the hostess to seat me. (I have since learned that SF does issue special license tags to service dogs for residents, so his confusion may have been understandable - but his complete lack of customer service was not.) He refused to give me his name, but should management of the restaurant want to identify him, he had a dark mustache and short beard. Fortunately, the available seat was at the other end of the sushi bar, so I didn't have to deal with him any further. The sushi itself was excellent, and the sushi chef who prepared mine was polite. Perhaps I should have just let it go, but when I left I told him, as politely as I could, that I hoped he had noticed that my service dog did not create ANY behavior problems and that his attitude could actually have resulted in the organization being sued. Rather than accepting my suggestion (which was intended to be helpful), he accused ME of being aggressive, said that some of his customers had said I was a witch, and in general ruined what would otherwise have been a very pleasant lunch. Perhaps he thought that a single woman might not spend enough ($70 should have been enough). I cannot recommend this place!

We had dinner here and ordered omakase but requested more sashimi than sushi. We started with a little spinach salad that was gorgeous and then moved onto sashimi and then onto various other courses. The selection of fish is amazing (with some flown in from Japan) and we also had the wagyu beef with truffles. The price was not that expensive if you compare it to what you would pay in Japan for similar produce.Service was good. The restaurant has no name on the door but the street number is above the door.Will definitely go back next time we are here.

Visited with my colleague from Japan. He was also very happy with the freshness of all orders. We went to Akiko twice in one week and we're not disappointed. All dishes are perfect and fresh. Don't expect to be full after eating here, but it gives you fully satisfaction.Service is good, but sometimes forget to orders. This is no problem though, as they pass by every minute.Overall amazing place and a must try if you are fan of sushi

We were treated like an inconvenience. We showed up at opening, 5:30p and was asked to wait outside another 5min for them to prep. Second, the hostess was annoyed she had to collect us from outside and said we had pushed the handicapped door opener - but we were on the other side of the door.Once seated though our waiter was extremely kind, helpful and polite. The sushi was incredible! We had one of each traditional and they were made to perfection.We would go again!!

My boyfriend and I went here for dinner the evening of 10/12. The cab dropped us off right in front of the restaurant, but I'm not kidding you when I said we had to do a triple take. There is NO sign outside or on the front door! It's completely non-obvious. We only knew we were at the right place because we saw people inside eating with chopsticks and the sushi bar workers. It was kind of humorous - but I think that's part of its charm! It's quaint.Once inside, it's pretty small - also adding to its quaintness. The sushi was wonderful, the sake was great, the gyoza and edamame - all good! The only small complaint is that the service was pretty slow. Once we sat down, it took a good ten minutes for our waiter to come to us.We did arrive at our reserved time of 7pm on a Saturday, so I'm sure that's the main reason. They were packed.Otherwise, I definitely recommend this gem. Great food and even better atmosphere!

We visited with friends on a recent trip to the city based on reviews on here and were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the sushi. The restaurant itself is small and noisy but the wait staff were helpful and attentive.We ordered wine and a number of different rolls to share. While it was not the very best sushi we've ever had it was very good and the presentation was very nice.Make sure you have the address for the restaurant with you when you visit to make it easier to find. Putting a sign out front would be helpful but we didn't have a problem because of advice from TA.

Small, slightly loud restaurant with the food making up for the noise. Fresh, elegantly smooth sushi...no soy sauce even needed with the sashimi, which I often need for sashimi. We had seaweed salad, 12pc sashimi, rock nroll and ended up adding the spicy tuna since the rolls are how rolls should be; focusing on the fish and ingredients, not submerging in spicy mayo, cream cheese and over the top ingredients to make palatable. Sashimi was buttery, succulent and definitely a must.

The fish was very fresh but I felt the prices were high relative to what was served. I ordered a combination dinner that included 4 small pieces of sashimi and some grilled fish. They were out of the fish (I can't remember now what it was) so they substituted 3 small pieces of grilled salmon. It didn't seem to be seasoned and came with no sauce. It was fine... but not at all memorable.

I went here for dinner and I guess was lucky to get a table without a reservation. I dont understand the reasoning behind no sign other than to make it confusing. The waiter suggested a sake based on what we requested and it was not very good. The dinner menu did not have a great selection of sushi rolls, and apparently they cannot make the rolls they make at lunch for dinner. That seemed odd because surely they have the ingredients. They had a long list of nightly specials that were all priced high.One thing that bothered me was when our sushi arrived, the waitress poured out soy sauce for us , &quot;based on the recommended amount to eat with sushi&quot; which was about half a teaspoon. It seemed silly that they would pour the soy for you. The spicy tuna roll was far too spicy, I walked out feeling like I burnt my tongue.I would not return it seemed so pretentious for not a lot of variety and very high prices.

This restaurant was just down and across from where we were staying in San Fran. We walked by otherwise we would not have realized there was a restaurant there. We walked in to see because it looked good and we were hungry. They were booked up but we made reservations for another night. We came back and thoroughly enjoyed our meal. This is a sushi place. If you don't like sushi, you probably won't be happy here as that really is most of the menu. But if you do- you'll really enjoy this. It's not the absolute best sushi I've ever had but it is very good and the service is excellent. It was fresh and clean and served in a very appetizing and beautiful manner. The place is very small but really manages not to feel that way somehow.

This is a small and wonderful sushi bar and restaurant near San Francisco's financial district. The seafood and fish are as fresh as anything we have ever tasted, the service is knowledgable and unobtrusive and the atmosphere is intimate and compelling. Fortunately for us, servings of our favorite fish, Copper River salmon, were available and, on the recommendation of our server, we also enjoyed the white version of that salmon as well. Everything positive written about this establishment is right on the mark. This is a must for both residents and visitors to this great city.

My husband and I made reservations a couple weeks before we went to San Francisco for Akiko's. I do suggest making reservations because that is the first thing they ask you, and I saw their list on a Tuesday night and it was full. It is a small place and there is no big sign outside so you need to know the address. The sushi was really good, I highly suggest the 49er roll, and they do not rush you through the meal. We ordered a couple things and when we finished them we ordered something else. So take your times and enjoy your food. It is a great place for couples or a group of adults.

In San Francisco on business. I booked Akiko several weeks earlier thru Open Table. I have eaten my share of sushi. I've hit Nobu - New York, Dallas, Las Vegas and London. But I don't think I've had anything as compelling as Akiko. Alone, I sat at the sushi bar and let the chef prepare what he felt was the freshest sashimi and nigiri. It was all incredible - flown in from Japan that day. I went from King Salmon belly, to a Japanese sea bass, to scallop nigiri, hamachi, and finished everything off with wagyu beef, lightly seared and dressed with shaved black truffle. Yep - all day long. Highly recommend. (Be careful - there are two Akiko's in SF - the other one a tiny hole-in-the-wall on Mason - their sushi ain't bad either).

Reservations are a must, but it was worth waiting the 3 days. (Be careful not to miss it, as there's no sign on it &amp; we walked right by.) It's a tiny restaurant, so they are able to be VERY attentive to all customers. The sushi is impeccable, exactly as it should be. We finally tasted what a REAL California roll is supposed to taste like (with REAL crab). The pieces of sashimi were very generous, as were all the pieces of fish on the nigiri. They make their own yummy wasabi and have fresh flavorful ginger. And lastly, they keep the sake warm throughout the meal, which added to our outstanding experience.

Walked right by the resto while looking for it based on what I thought I remembered of the address. Was expecting a sign outside... don't, no signage. Just a front that looks like an Irish pub. LOLChose Akiko's based on another site's reco from many locals (wanted to avoid the tourist traps).Went off the menu + glad we did. The chef created a memorable dining experience that left us wanting more.All I can say is FRESH. FRESH. FRESH!We love sashimi and it's got to be fresh to really enjoy the taste of the fish. Akiko's had no problem delivering on that.Service was amazingly efficient. Water was always topped off which is one of the key things for me in particular. The wait staff was attentive, always stopping by to see if our table needed clean-up or extra this or that. Professional all the way!The hostess was great too. She accommodated our walk-up-no-reservation-table-for-3 request and made us feel welcome to what seemed like a locals only type sushi resto.The only CON i can list for this place... the single stall uni-sex bathroom. You might need to wait in line to use it... so plan accordingly. :)Highly recommend this place. Just loved everything about it. Dinner was highlighted by an order of their A5 Plus Wagyu beef topped with White Truffle. It wasn't cheap, but it was worth it!!PS. Our main server, Alan, was PRO all the way! He really made our dinner a memorable experience.TIP: Make a reservation!

First, make a reservation. We made the mistake and tried to walk in; they are booked several days in advanced so call ahead to get. We were able to squeeze on to the reservation list the next night and what an excellent experience. Our waiter and the staff were very friendly and very customer service oriented. The ticket machine broke and the orders backed up, which we didn't really mind because we like taking our time at dinner. Regardless, they apoligized several times and gave us a complementary sushi roll to hold us over. I would highly recommend the sashimi sampler which included butter fish, hamachi, mackeral, flounder, salmon, and tuna. Very fresh!!

It was 285 feet from The Inn at Union Square. If we hadn't learned about it on Trip Advisor, we would've walked right by. Yes, hole-in-the-wall restaurant with 4 tables and 4 stools at the sushi bar, BUT oh what fresh seafood. The owner goes to the fish market every morning!!!! What owner does that? It was all amazing: yellowfin tuna, ahi, mackerel, roasted salmon skin (like butta'), hot premium sake, cold beer, sumo roll, cabbage salad, tobiko that was almost glowing it was so orange. If in the area, you've gotta try this place. Told them they needed a Trip Advisor sign on the door. We met a lady from the UK that had traveled from Sacramento to eat there as she had read the reviews too.

My wife (Japanese) and I were staying across the street at the Orchard Garden Hotel and were hanging in SF on a recent very rainy weekend....we had made reservations for a nice Italian restaurant for later on a Saturday night but were not in the mood to get dressed up with weather and decided to try Akiko. We lingered by the entrance about 10 minutes prior to opening, a bit anxious as the sign at the door said reservations only. Once they opened we asked about being seated and we were. Our lucky night as at least a dozen other groups/couples wondered in and were turned away without reservations....anyways, will keep this short. The sushi, tempura and other choices we made were all outstanding. Service was solid to very good and was a nice atmosphere. We were impressed and marked this down as a new favorite spot in San Francisco.

I was looking for a place near public transportation and near a coffee shop for my quarterly girls get together which was my turn for hosting. I looked under Japanese restaurants in SF on yelp and came upon this place which may be alittle hard to find, considering that their sign is barely noticeable. They are right across from the Academy of Art and a few doors from Le Central. I made reservations through Open Table for 5 and 3 of us took public transportation while the other two found street parking right after 6 PM, not a problem. Service was fast and food was fresh. Some of the items we had were: wakame salad (tasty), saba and sashimi, salmon teriyaki and sashimi, chicken katsu, and hamachi kama. All were delicious. In the sashimi, we had four pieces of fish: salmon, tuna, butterfish and red snapper. Alittle on the pricey side but this is to be expected in the Union Square area.

The menu, without specials, raised the bar by having a greater variety of fish for both sashimi and ngiri than previously experienced at many SF sushi restaurants.What made this experience outstanding, however was the knowledge of the the server and chefs and the 'off the menu specials'.We got great service and felt really welcome - we ate early and were luck enough to get a table without reservations but recommend you book first as many were turned away after we had been seated.It was not cheap but if you like sushi this restaurant is for you!!

If you look at my other reviews you will note that sushi is not an uncommon cuisine for me to partake of. My last trip to California, in the San Diego area, left me wondering what all the fuss about California sushi was. This trip answered that question.Akiko's, so very conveniently located a door from my hotel, was a magnificent find and ranks as the all-time best sushi I've ever had. Everything was fresh, flavourful, and masterfully presented. I travel a great deal for work and always try to visit new places each night I am in a city but Akiko's was so incredible I had to come back for a second and third evening out of my 6 in San Francisco.From the gently-seared nigiri to the uni bursting with flavour everything was top-notch. I have not a single negative or qualified statement, Akiko's was all-around incredible.Prices were competitive for sushi, very reasonable. The wait staff is very attentive.Something I GREATLY appreciated is that my sushi was brought to me one item at a time. My spider roll did not appear until my nigiri was finished, savoured, and the dish cleared and so on. That little touch, something that so many other establishments can't seem to figure out, made my dinners so much more relaxing and enjoyable.It also speaks volumes that on my final night there I sat next to a sushi chef from another restaurant. If the competition comes to eat at your restaurant, you're clearly doing it right.

I agree with the poster who said that this restaurant deserves 4 1/2 stars. The sushi itself is awesome--completely top notch. I was with a large group, and we tried a ton of different rolls. Even the basic California and cucumber rolls were fantastic. The service was a touch slow, and one of our beers came out room temperature, but was promptly corrected. I can't imagine there would be another place in the city with much better sushi, so I highly recommend checking this place out.

Let's be clear: this is some of the finest if not the finest sushi I have ever had. That includes the cities of Tokyo and Kyoto too.I passed right by the restaurant...the storefront is understated and easy to miss. I walked in and the other reviews are correct: the place is small! Loud too, mostly due to the hard walls and ceiling. The place was totally full although there was one 2-seat table open. Curiously, they said I had to wait and then 10 minutes later they put me at that open table.Happy to get seated after a long day of flying, I opened the cold sake menu and was delighted by the choices. A minor complaint: the menu font was small and printed in grey and with the low light level, I had to use the candle lamp on the table to read with my old eyes. Prices for the sake were a little steep but there were a number of reasonably priced sakes of good quality.Service was a bit frenetic and slow but eventually they came by my table tucked into the front corner and took my order. The hostess didn't write it down and my order was a bit extensive and I figured she would forget something and she did. I had ordered one of the rolls but let me tell you, I am glad they forgot it because the choices of fish were so varied, it left me more room to try them!Shrimp tempura appetizer was typical. Good and delicious but not a standout. Then the hamachi sashimi came out and it was superb and I marveled at the subtle flavor and buttery texture. The temperature was perfect. If this is what the rest of my meal would be, I was in for a treat.Uni, unagi, shiro maguro...a mature yellowtail I have never had before...it was all exceedingly fresh, perfectly prepared and absolutely delicious. This is why I was happy they forgot the roll...although they looked delicious, I wanted to try some of the other fish on the menu. One of the servers, Joseph, came by and asked how the food was and needless to say, I expounded on the subject. Turns out the sushi chef, a mature and jolly-faced fellow, has been a sushi chef since age 13. That man makes this restaurant; His knowledge and selection of only the finest quality fish results in a dining experience that is unmatched.Joseph went on to recommend some ocean farmed fatty tuna (toro) and it was superb. Turns out the chef is very concerned about tuna sustainability and buys direct from one of the farmers in Japan.I cannot see any reason this place deserves less than 4 stars. If you give it less, you simply don't know sushi or are responding to the size or ambiance of the restaurant. I wish the sushi bar was bigger so I could have sat in front of the chef and just had him toss whatever he thought I would like my way!After another sake, it was time to go and I went to the bar to give my compliments to the chef. The bill was moderate ($100), but for the quality a bargain in my experience. I have had $150 bills (for one person) in New York and Tokyo and although those places were good, they are measurably below the quality of Akiko's.I am still searching my past experiences to see if any can compare to Akiko and I cannot come up with any that are better. I look forward to my next trip to SFO so I can again partake of this chef's art.

Keep the food coming!

On our first night of our stay in San Francisco, we were looking for a Japanese restaurant, and my fiance found this. It has good reviews on yelp and was close to where we were staying, so we walked over. The restaurant was busy, which is a good sign! After waiting for a few minutes, we sat down and looked over the menu. Akiko's provides a good variety of Japanese foods from edamame to sushi to mochi ice-cream.We ordered the seaweed salad, which was incredible. It does use a little bit of sesame oil, so if you're allergic, stay away, but if not, it's a must try, especially after spending a hot day in the sun! Super refreshing! It went well with our Orion beer (it's a special beer from Okinawa; hard to get). We also ordered a bunch of sushi, including the those from the specials menu: various salmon, tobiko, and unagi. It was a bit strange that they were out of tamago, which should be the easiest to make, but that's okay; we ended up ordering another type of salmon sushi. Oh, we also had the teriyaki chicken. It's actually a meal itself with a side of rice and vegetables. While it was delicious, I don't think we'll order that next time so that we would have more room for sushi!We finished the meal with macha mochi ice-cream. Yuuuum!

Freshest fish ever

This place is amazing! I am writing the review as I am eating the sushi. I don't think I have eaten fresher fish in the U.S. The mackerel melts in your mouth like butter. And the white tuna and red snapper are unbelievably flavorful. I happened to be passing this restaurant and decided to get dinner without knowing anything about it. I am glad I decided to eat dinner here! Sadly, I don't live in San Francisco or I would eat here weekly.

disappointing sushi and the worst udon noodle

fish was not that fresh and too much seasoning in rice overpowered fish taste.udon noodle was the worst. I would rather prefer an instant udon noodle, which is much better.Udon here is like a chinese soup with chicken broth. Actually I heard chef and waiteress talking in Chinese. i would not recommend to go.
