The place is nice and quiet enough, so it's not hard to hear your friends and have a conversation. The food was boring. Felt like all the dishes tasted more or less the same. We took two of their tasting menu, which should give a variety of thing to try. But it was just plain boring. Service was great though, and we had fun with our friends. So all in all it was a good experience.

We visited on a Friday night and it was very busy, we waited over and hour to get a table. However, it was worth it. If you visit reserve a table! If we had known it was this busy we would have done the same. The dosa's are brilliant, very tasty. We also had the idli fries which we enjoyed, haven't tasted those before.

DOSA is not a typical indian restaurant. It's interesting fusuon of culinary creativity and bold flavors of south indian cuisine. The signature street food of Bombay was presented as hometown bar sliders. Tasty dahiwada was presented with elegance of delicately decorated latte coffee. (See posted pictures). Truffles dosa was a interesting balance of European and indian flavors. Lamb Keema Dosa was finger licking good. Mungdal dosa was satisfyingly good choice for health conscious foody.Overall great experience.

Met friends there last night as they've eaten there a lot. Fast service and attentive wait staff. Food was pretty good but not as great as we expected. I had the Autumn Uttapam which wasn't supposed to be spicy but it was so hot even without the sambar that it brought tears to my eyes. One of my friends had the same and his wasn't spicy at all. I would have requested something else but we were on our way to a performance and didn't have time to wait. Probably won't go back. Also large restaurant and very noisy.

We were a group of six people who shared about 10 or so dishes. Everything we had was excellent. The presentation was beautiful, the server was informative and helpful. I particularly loved the mushroom Uttapam and the rice Idli fries. The coconut custard cake was outrageously great. The only dish that was not perfect was the pear tart dessert. Highly recommended and I will be back.

High End Indian restaurant

It is difficult to find a very high end Chinese restaurant in US. Same goes for Indian restaurant. Most of the Indian restaurant are better and nicer than a lot of Chinese restaurant but I would not call them high end. Here comes Dosa. If you want to experience exotic spices of India in a luxurious and modern setting, this is for you. Disclaimer, I am not an expert on Indian food and so I am not sure this is how high end restaurant in India is like. However, the food we sample are all good to pretty great. Nicely plated and presented, good on the spice and not too toned down for American palate. For those who drinks, definitely sample the inventive cocktails they have here made with exotic spices. I had Stephen Curry, Forbidden City and King Khan. They were all great and so unique that I doubt you can find them elsewhere. The dessert was also amazing.This restaurant is a bit on the pricier side. Definitely not a good place for kids unless your toddler has the palate for spicy food. I had to fill my 6 and 7 years old up with 2 different kind of Naan bread, although they loved the bread.For single guys, If you run into a special someone who is well sampled on world cuisine and spices, this is the place to impress her or him.

Best dosa ever

Let me start with letting you know that I am one of those who avoid having dosa.. I just don't like dosa.. But if I am in San Fransisco, I will go back to this restaurant for dosa.I was invited into this restaurant for a pre wedding party. We had a limited menu for a sit down dinner I chose dosa with spice and garlic and chicken korma for the main course.. There were kale pakoras and dahi wada and lentils salad for the appetizers.. These appetizers were amazing .. I just loved the kale pakoras.. Cooked to perfection.Next on my table was my dosa.. The dosa was soft enough to be eaten with a fork and knife and crisp enough to be the best dosa. The sambar that came with the dosa wasn't a watery mix of veggies but it was a beautiful looking rich curry with veggies. I couldn't believe I was having dosa and loving it..The chicken korma was also one of the best I have ever had.For dessert they served carrot cake with ice cream which I didn't like much.. But again.. I was having a specific menu so can't comment on the dessert much.

We j6st happened upon this really hip and classy spot. Sat at the bar for dinner and got great service from the barkeeper. The classic masala dosa was superb. Prepared somewhat differently from the routine dosa. Not entirely rolled up and less filling inside than the standard dosa. The taste of the ghee in the dough came through nocely. The sliders were superb - spicy, juicy and dense. The carbonated monsoon fruit drink was an unexpected plus.

We booked at Dosa last minute and didn't manage to get a table until 9.15 (so we advise booking early) but wow was it worth it. We had a starter, a dosa (crispy pancake with a filling and a spicy soup to accompany) a main and a dessert to share. This proved a good amount for us, but it depends on your appetite! The food was unfailingly delicious, particularly the wild Alaskan salmon main and the spiced kulfi with chocolate chilli fudge sauce. The service was extremely good, and the atmosphere had a nice buzz without being too loud. Would definitely go there again and again.

Our table were all fans of Indian cuisine and were aware that Dosa was a non traditional Indian restaurant. This is a very popular, trendy, destination restaurant for a visitor to SF. The menu consists of a wide selection of small plates, dosas, uttapams, and limited entrees. We ordered the 5 different uttapams and found them boring, our mistake. The entree was the lamb chops which consisted of 3 chops on a stack of roasted potatoes. The chops were far too thin and hence over cooked and dry. What can you say about too many roasted potatoes, other than half that quantity with some other roasted root vegetables would have worked better. The lamb was the real disappointment-happy we didn't have a double order as we were contemplating. Our best dish was the Chennai Chicken.Overall it was the food that left us wanting. The service and decor were top notch.

Awesome food, great ambience but terrible service experience. Our cocktails and beer didn't show until after our dinner and we had to ask for it. The cocktail glass was dirty so we sent it back. They still ended up charging for it although it was taken off when we called it out. They bought a wrong order to our table and never got our youngest daughter's food. The server was hardly around after the initial order. He mentioned desserts but decided to get the check instead of asking us if wanted any after our entrees.We went to the place on our first family trip to SFO based on all the hype but were very disappointed by the experience. After we pointed our experience to the manager, we got the 'we are sorry' response. Overall, a very 'sorry' experience given the price point.

Delicious South Indian fusion food - on a prince&#39;s budget
Rating: 3

Dosa is named after dosa, a unique South Indian delicacy made with rice flour &amp; lentil batter. Think of pancake / burrito fusion - the batter is flattened on a griddle then rolled around some delicious fixings, like curried potatoes, mushrooms, even lamb. Dosa's are a great deal, about $15, and you can share 1 or 2 with a friend. I also love their teas because they are supercharged and have some unique flavors. Salads are hit or miss, sometimes they're too spicy. The vaulted ceilings give a Rajput ambiance and you feel like you're holding court and having conversation like a king. The problem is, if you order a curry, you are going to spend like one. They are upwards of $25 to $35 - for a traditional Indian curry with rice. Our mushroom curry had about 4 mushrooms in it - I was shocked at the pricing and the portions. It was delicious but not worth the expense. Haven't called the manager but I will - worth revisiting but sadly not the curry.

What a place. Those flavors of Northern India just permeate your soul! This used to be the old Goodwill Store in the Fillmore. The whole space was transformed several years ago to this soaring, roomy, shiny spot for brunch, lunch, dinner and late night drinking. What a crowd! I have met so many interesting people here--no one is a &quot;cookie-cutter&quot; boring guest. It must be the food. Fantastic--do NOT miss the little crisp cups or &quot;pams&quot; of bread you can place mung beans, potatoes, and garbanzos into and then pour one of two sauces on them. Or the Vada Pav vegetarian slider is a surprise with its carmelized onions and chilis. For lamb lovers, ANYTHING with lamb at this restaurant is perfect. There is a special brunch dish (I think called &quot;Thali&quot;) that features lamb with TWELVE dipping sauces. Very very VERY good food!!! The only slight disappointment is the dismissive service. The bussers are excellent, but the main servers seem to not care much. I've eaten here eight times and the service is half/half as to attentiveness. The evening crowd gets quite loud and happy. Several are moving on to the famous Boom-Boom Room a block away for a late evening of hip music.

I tried to make reservations through Open Table, but nothing was available at our designated time so I arrived early and thought I'd try to walk in instead. To my delight, the hostess said no problem and said we'd have no problem getting a table when the rest of my party showed up. In the meantime, I pulled up to the bar and was scanning with my eyes the shelf lined with Gin when the bartender approached and brought me a beverage menu and opened the page directly to the gins. Now that's good. A woman two seats away recommended the Hendricks and house tonic and it was awesome.After we were seated, our waiter was very well versed on the menu and made recommendations for us. All was very tasty, but I will say that the service by far spoke to me louder than the food. Well done staff at Dosa!

My teenager and I loved having dinner at Dosa on Fillmore. The atmosphere is beautiful and upscale and the food is delicious - we love Indian food and were able to try several dishes we'd never had before including their famous dosas. We also loved their chutney sampler appetizer and very special non-alcoholic drinks. The prices are very reasonable and I felt it was a great value for the money - plus it's just really fun and lovely to eat here. This is a very fun and vibrant restaurant and we really had a great time!

I've gone to Dosa about 15 times, and I have to say it's one of my favorites. Quality is *usually* consistent.(Meaning, 10/15 times I loved it, 5/15 they didn't cook dishes correctly and the staff didn't seem to understand what was wrong)Tips:- If the pappadum you get served in the beginning is soft (doesn't have a fresh crunch) then ask to replace it. It's not supposed to be soft or soggy, and pretty amazing when fresh.- FAVORITE dishes are the Vada Pav and Shikampuri Kabob Sliders. They are similar taste profiles, so at least order one. Don't leave Dosa without trying one... or you'll have missed out on the best dishes on the menu.

This is an extremely busy restaurant, reason being fantastic food and flawless service. We had Masala dosas, Ghee roast dosa (my son's favourite, we actually went there for him), Hyderabadi biriyani, fish moilee, butter chicken, mini uthappam etc. All dishes had it's own individual flavour and taste. The waiters were patiently trying to explain to us the content of the menu but since we knew what was on the menu, ordered quickly. We were so full that I thought of calling a taxi to go to the parking lot from my seat! If you like Indian food or would like to try, you must visit this restaurant. The prices are a bit expensive but when compared to the quality of food, taste and service levels, it is certainly worth paying!

I have visited here 2 nights in a row and plan to go back tonight. This is very unlike me as I rarely find places that draw me back - the authenticity of the food shines through with a varied menu, and great balance of flavours and heat. Dosas are well executed and last nights Tamil curry with lemon rice was exquisite. My husband had the selection of upattams ( also great for sharing).Very welcoming front of house who noticed we had visited the previous evening so found us a table even though restaurant full. The Waitress upstairs was really knowledgable and willing to help us make good menu choices. We had a mix up re our wine selection - the staff accepted there had been a mistake and delivered the wine we had chosen - we were impressed with the smoothness and graciousness in the interaction.So.... If you fancy high quality Indian food with great service this is the place to go.

I have not had Southern Indian food before, so the dosa was unfamiliar to me. They are very large sort of crepes, filled with various veggies/meats and folded.They have a separate menu listing which items are gluten- or dairy- or meat- free which was very helpful to the two vegetarian/vegans in our group. The items were all a bit on the hot side, even though the waited said they are mild. Two of our party do not handle any heat/spiciness very well.I am vegan and would have liked a larger selection of vegetable dishes other than potatoes, but I did very much like what I had. Two of our party had a chicken dish that they also said was very good.Service was excellent, as was the ambience - not too noisy, and lovely decor.I would definitely return when back in SF.

How they get those dosas both crispy and light is a mystery, but they were delicious. The sweet potato dosa was the hit of the table. Desserts are a step up from many Indian restaurant offerings and was a pleasant cap to the dinner.

This is not your run of the mill Indian restaurant that offers a huge menu covering all regions, this is very specific South Indian food (which I'm fortunate to have close to where I live) and the food is really delicious. We managed to get short notice reservations, and the place was packed, great atmosphere if a little noisy. Warmly welcomed and settled down with cocktails whilst we peruse the menu, and then food was reasonably quick to arrive once ordered.Really loved it.

Been to DOSA place by looking at other reviews to get authentic south Indian Jain food. Ordered Jain uttapam, and received the one with Onion on. Lack of communication between the person takes an order (praised a restaurant like 5 *) and chef. Also replacement uttapam came in size of chappati and very thin, so need to order one more to fill my tummy. Normally authentic south Indian uttapam are thick like pan cake. Also got charged almost double than other south Indian restaurants in SFO. By looking at pictures of Dosa and other recipes, looks good. Just go for other restaurants if you prefer uttapam.

It has been years and years since I enjoyed a good Dosa comparable to those I ate in the UK. As luck would have it, I was seated next to a perfectly delightful guy on my flight to SFO and he highly recommended Dosa on Fillmore.Immediately this became part of my itinerary and I dined there this evening. Although it's Diwali, I decided against the special menu as I wasn't sure I'd be able to eat it all and, instead opted for a Samosa starter and Mung Bean Dosa. Both dishes were wonderful - just the right amount of heat and accompanied by delicious sauces for dipping. I wish I'd had room for more, but had to give in at a certain point because I was so full!The ambience and decor is lovely and quite comfortable. Service was fantastic as well. Thank you seat mate, Ryan, for this recommendation. It was spot on for me and I will be back!

The decor is sort of bizarre and maybe a bit dated but the space is comfortable and fun. The food, menu and cocktails are interesting and worth a try but the flavors and textures are just a little unrefined.

This was the second visit for the three of us, and once again, a wonderful meal! This time we had Pumpkin Dal, Calamari, Chennai Chicken and Masala Dosa. Everything was incredible! What a treat to have great seafood in an Indian restaurant. Last visit we had fish, which was good, but the calamari this time was perfect. Some of the dishes on the menu are odd, and some northern standards are missing (especially nan) but if you're willing to be adventurous, it will reward you with a very tasty meal that doesn't lead you into comparing their chicken masala with the last Indian meal you had. Worth exploring, but do make reservations as they are always busy! Not surprising.

Contemporary indian cuisine; these three words pretty much sum up the restaurant.The high ceilings, open floor plan, modern design all make it a very fun &amp; vibrant place for one to enjoy an indian cuisine.Con; the food is pretty good but not outstandingly authentic to Indian cuisine.The drinks, not so creative, just your regular fancy restaurant type.Overall though it's a cool place to enjoy indian cuisine.

In London we have some of the best indian restaurants outside of India and DOSA matched the best of them. The service was impeccable and the food was even better. Their extensive menu will have your tastebuds tingling from the first bite. Great for a fun, casual dinner or a romantic night for 2.

I wasn't expecting this when my friends decided to take me to a place called DOSA in San Francisco - but the food was fantastic. We waited for a table for close to 45 minutes - but spent some &quot;quality&quot; time at the bar. Go now - go soon, this is some amazing food.

My visit to DOSA was interesting. The food was pretty good but standard Indian fare, the restaurant is beautiful, but when the waiter asked if I'd ever been and I replied no, he acted like I had never need to an Indian restaurant before.Food came fast and portions were generous. Spices pretty authentic. Lots of attitude.

The dosas are always a good plate to share. It is a fermented flat bread that has three different dipping sauces at this restaurant. Another dish for sharing are the uttapams, like small pancakes. The chef special has 5 different types along with dipping sauces. Be careful; some are quite spicy. Along with appetizers and small plates are items like chicken biryani. There is something for everyone, as many dishes are vegetarian. Can't recall if there are any gluten-free. Also, the drinks are imaginative

Came here as a group of six which worked out very well for sharing a wide variety of dishes and breads. We started with a sampling of shareable small plates like the Chennai chicken and Idli, and four of us divided two servings of the Rasam &quot;fire broth&quot; soup - delicious and not as unbearably spicy as it sounds. We shared several entrees, notably the Hyderbadi lamb chops and also several dosas, spectacular creations filled with tasty goodies. We ordered several different breads and were rewarded with a variety of giant puffy (and very good) creations. We ended with a sampling of four of the desserts (I've always wanted to walk into a great place and simply order &quot;one of each!&quot; - we came close). This was a very fun place (but, of course, we were a fun group). Our well informed server warned that all the dishes were spicy to some degree but even the most sensitive palates at the table managed well. Several of us had the Tempranillo (Rioja) but there were also some Indian offerings and Kingfisher beer. This scored as a memorable taste treat.

We went here as couples the other night. We ordered the Petra Unger greener veltliner white wine, which paired perfectly with our spicy meal. We had the shredded duck, and chicken biryani, which were excellent, as well as the prawn marsala, the lamb paratha and the eggplant. Very good food unless you have spent time in the U.K. or India.Unfortunately service was subpar. Despite there being open tables, our waiter was not attentive. We had to get up and pour our own wine, as well as chase him down to take our orders.Not the cheapest place by any means, either.

Having been used to South Indian food for such a long time, it takes a mountain of a task for a South Indian restaurant to get my vote. In the U.S. I have had South Indian food in many places too - and this I would say is among the best I have had. The vada sambar and masala dosa were fitting examples.The setting is upscale and so are the prices. Has both veg and non-veg food.Street parking available around the restaurant.If you are looking to relish South Indian food in a very classy ambience , this could be your stop.

Two of us had an early business dinner. I did not particularly like the arrangement (chair opposite bench) and the noise made it hard to here. Tables are close together. Cocktails are interesting and tasty. Had the Mango is the new Black....terrific. We opted for fish dishes (branzino in banana leaf, and spicy yellowtail). Both flavorful and plentiful. The sides (rice and eggplant) were disappointing. All in all, a good selection.

We went here for lunch to have some dosas which are a South Indian speciality. I ordered the Rava Masala Dosa which is made with semolina; the dosa was soaked in oil; my wife had a South Indian omelette which was again drenched in oil. Both of us developed very bad acidity on account of the grease later in the day; definitely not on my favourite list. Though their counter at Whole Foods in Cupertino gets high marks, the same can't be said about Dosa on Fillmore.

The ambience, service and food at Dosa was superb. It was our first experience of Southern Indian food and our servers recommendations of which dishes and how many to order was perfect. It is excellent for a restaurant to advise you to order less than you would have ordered and their advice to be correct. We have been to too many restaurants where they would let you over order.Super culinary experience.

Different spin on the normal blend of Indian cuisine we experience in the UK. There are seasonal specials to tempt one &amp; maintain interest for the regulars. There were so many dishes that I had not seen before that choosing was a challenge so we went for the family style sharing approach. Dosas &amp; uttapams were a revelation. The final course was a coconut &amp; lime sorbet. A delightfully refreshing end but a little bit sweeter than I had imagined. The servers are very helpful in helping to choose dishes and accompanying wines.

We went to the Sundance cinema and this was directly opposite. We only had a small amount of time but they managed to accommodate us. Although the decision to go there was a last minute one and we didn't have time to think about where to eat, this was the best food experience we have had in the whole of San Francisco. It was all beautifully presented and well spiced, using fresh ingredients. It was imaginative and a bit playful with a massive cushion of thin bread as part of one dish. The area was great and this was a good choice. So as native or visitor,couple group or family I think you will find this a good quality and enjoyable place to eat.

The dosa here is good but not better than what is available in many Indian vegetarian restaurants. The real reason to go is that you can eat dosa and have an array of non-vegetarian dishes too, all in a stylish setting. The masala fish appetizer was delicious. The drinks (dosa version of gin and tonic and the &quot;ante ginger&quot;) were creative. The dessert was too creative- coconut milk panna cotta with chili powder, which burned too much for a dessert in my opinion. Aside from that dessert, I will be happy to eat here again.

Had to tell the dude to stop messing around!Since our group was a large one, we ordered one in all the dishes from the menu and to our disappointment every dish that was served was not up to the mark - either not fully cooked or not made the right way! The only silver lining was the dhahi vada which was okay!

The food at DOSA is very special, wonderful flavors and textures, with an exciting combination of spices. The bar seating was full and more young San Franciscans were crowded around the lively area. We were seated right away at the comfortable communal table, ordered drinks and shared a series of small items: Lamb Kebab Slider (my favorite), Shredded Duck Vindaloo (hot!) with Onion Uttapam, Chennai Chicken (my son's favorite), and a Spicy Basil Dosa. We ended with a Bru Coffee Pot de Creme and 10 year Port - wonderful! Our server, Tamar, was perfect - friendly, professional, and helpful without intrusion.

The Uttapam sampler was interesting. The puffed bread called poori was very good with the asparagus and snow peas salad. For dessert we had ginger gelato and a panna cotta.

3 weeks of holidaying in the U.S. had left me craving for some good South Indian food, yesterday some friends took us to Dosa on Fillmore for lunch and I felt blessed ! We got there at 2:30pm. The ambience of this restaurant sets it apart, tall ceiling, a huge bar with bar stools and some good service. Very chic indeed. Unfortunately we were told that the 'thaali' or veg meal was not available for order so ordered for a variety of dosas. I tried the 'Roasted Chili &amp; Garlic Masala' dosa. Terrific !!. Albeit spicy. The flavor of the pungent chutney in the dosa was sheer ecstasy after eating bland food for most of last 3 weeks. My wife tried the idli sambar- the idlis come soaked in sambar. For those of you who would not like that , you may want to tell them to give the sambar separately. The dosas and idli are served with a red chutney and green chutney. Both made from fresh coconut and delicious. My wife also ordered for some curd rice. The curd rice was made from long grained Basmati rice, not mashed and a bit dry. However very good..our friends tried the Mung Dal dosa and the Kerala Paratha with egg curry. The parathas looked nice but were not made the way a traditional Kerala paratha is-with layers. The menu has a wide variety of options to suit a variety of taste buds. Certainly recommended..We will visit again.

Our first time at Dosa last night was great. I knew Southern Indian was spicier than Northern Indian food, but I didn't realize how much! Even the so-called milder dishes had quite a kick but they were quite tasty. The complexity of the spices, the freshness of the ingredients was impressive. The waitress was excellent in giving us honest answers and recommendations. The only reason I didn't give Dosa a 5 was because my taste is less accepting of the level of heat than was in some of the dishes, but my companions probably would have given it a 5. Lovely ambiance though noisy. Staff as a whole was knowledgeable and the food was consistently high quality.

Was in San Francisco for Spring break with my daughter and decided on Dosa for several reasons. My daughter and I both love indian food and the menu looked good for people with celiac disease. My daughter has celiac and travel can be a challenge. I would say that 90% of the menu was gluten free or could be adjusted to be gluten free and the food was absolutely outstanding. The wait staff was knowledgeable and helpful and we ate until we couldn't eat any more. Would definitely go back and highly recommend it. Ambience was beautiful and we loved the location on Fillmore street.

This was our first experience with South Indian cuisine and dosa. If you are not familiar, they are rice and lentil crepes filled with a host of savory ingredients. We went for lunch and were immediately taken in by the overall ambiance. Our waitress was very attentive and well versed on the menu. We started with an amazing cocktail, gin with fig and cardamom infused tonic. It had a very unique flavor profile, a nice twist on the classic drink. Our appetizers were the chutney sampler (sweet onion, roasted chili garlic, yogurt mint, and tamarind) with papadam and some scrumptious beet croquettes. I have had similar chutneys in other establishments but these were a notch above most that I have had before. The croquettes were also quite tasty, with hints of ginger and turmeric. We shared two dosa dishes, spicy mung masala and lamb keema. The mung lentils were mixed with green chilis and spiced potatoes that really peaked the tastebuds but didn't overpower. The lamb was ground and mixed with tiny chunks of potato. The dosa themselves were aromatic and delicious, and the lentil dipping soup they served with it rounded out each dish perfectly. We finished with a saffron coconut panna cotta and left quite satisfied.I found this to be a wonderful new experience in Indian cuisine and look forward to returning on our next visit to SF.

Dosa on Fillmore is a great Indian restaurant.By the time we left, the restaurant was mostly full of what appeared to be folks of Indian heritage. I think that is a very good sign for producing high-quality and authentic Indian dishes.Our family of five was able to select an item or two from each part of the menu. We were expertly guided by a friendly and knowledgeable server. The service overall was great.The facility itself is pretty nice - clean feeling and enough space between tables to allow an intimate dining experience.We tried a couple of small plates, a chicken Thali (meal in itself), a shrimp &quot;Frankie,&quot; the spicy basil dosa (highly recommended) and a mushroom Uttapam. My favorite however was the Bhel Puri - a taste sensation from the small plates list.Give it a try. Dosa does a great job.

Upon dining in this fine establishment, I was a newbie to Indian cuisine. We had a reservation, but arrived far too early. We had the option of sitting at a really fun communal table, but opted to wait for a table, as we were a couple of friends who hadn't seen each other for quite some time. The staff was quite accommodating, and found us a table pretty quickly.We ordered from the tasting menu, allowing us to try a whole bunch of different things - the Dosas were fabulous, as was the Halibut, and the Lamb - I'm not a fan of Lamb, but Dosa has made me a convert.The flavors in the lentil soup and various chutneys were all so very expertly layered, this has gone down in history as one of my favorite experiences along the culinary journey of life. Thanks Dosa!

This is a pretty restaurant with high ceilings and fun drinks that are on the sweet side for my taste. The appetizers were very good, but we were very disappointed with the Dosas. They were not thin and crispy at all, and were not served hot enough either. The main courses were all very tasty but they were also very pricey. And it is quite noisy inside, so not a spot for a quiet romantic dinner.

A fun, engaging, energetic place with fabulous food. Two people dinner with wine about $120 - good value in our mind. Enjoyed the southern Indian style which is not what you ordinarily find. Will come again when in town.

Nice Indian fast food place - expensive but great taste
Rating: 4

Dosa place has an extensive menu to choose from. I think they can keep it simple. Cocktail I ordered &quot;mango is new black&quot; is weirdly named but tasty - quantity is not so good so makes you feel over priced. Masala dosa is well done. Southern Moon - combination of five different Utappam is good except one type. Sambaar - lentil soup is amazingly well cocked. Staff is friendly but not quick enough. Ambiance is great. Location is perfect for a dinner after movie. Familiarity of staff with dishes is impressive, they are well trained how they say the dishes names, close to Indian. Reason I'm going with four rating because of price and service over all. For a fast food pricing can be little less expensive. I will recommend this place for sure. Will go again to try more dishes.

Best Indian Food I&#39;ve Had - Ever

I love Indian food and have been fortunate to enjoy it both in the States and abroad. I can say that Dosa had the best Indian food I've ever tasted and, if I could, I'd give it six circles.I took my daughter and her roommates to Dosa for dinner. They were kind enough to accommodate us although our reservation was only for two by seating us at one of the longer tables. I regret the name of our server but he was the key to our wonderful meal (it could be Kevin but that's close to a WAG).I've never had a server order for us but in this case we did. He did a miraculous job of providing appetizers and entrees that everyone LOVED.Sadly, I can't recall everything we ordered but I remember outstanding dosas, curry, a chutney sampler, eggplant poriyal, and okra kuzhambu. Everything was delicious and there wasn't a drop of food left.Reservations are a must and expect some wait. The bar is crowded and drinks expensive but that's San Francisco.

Dosa is not too far from our hotel in Japantown on Filmore. We have a daughter with cilia can disease and they offer gluten free choices. We'd passed the resturant a few times and it looked very nice. The menu also was promising. The reviews have been outstanding. My other daughter did a semester in southern India and my wife and I visited too. I've been eating Indian food for 40 years, my next door neighbor was from south India and introduced me to South Indian food before I ever had the more common to the US northern styles. So are very familiar with southern Indian food.So we were all excited about eating here. However...To start we couldn't have chai because they couldn't make hot beverages. Uh in India (and at home) all it took to make chai was a pot, water, spices, milk and a stove. They didn't have a pot and a fire? Btw later we saw people having coffee. Did they fix it and not bother to say to us, &quot;hey we fixed it we can make you chai, now.&quot; But that would have been impossible as the only person who knew we wanted chai was the captain and...read on.After ordering the tasting menu it seemed that our food was taking forever. The captain came by for the first time in 50 minutes and said the kitchen lost the check, the printer broke and was just now cooking our food. He noticed that it was taking a long time, duh! If he had been attentive he might have noticed this oh 30 minutes earlier. To apologize they were going to give us deserts for free (turns out only two of the three we ordered).When the food finally arrived two regular waiters came to deliver my wife and 1 daughter's seafood vada, and the 2nd guy brought some lamb dish to me which I didn't ordered for an apputizer. I thought maybe the other daughter but no. The captain shooed away that waiter and returned with a different waiter bringing our kale pakoras. Not going well, huh?The seafood vadas were just ok. The two chutneys: cilantro and tamarind were excellent. The kale pakoras were great as were their two chutneys: coconut/mint and tamarind.Two of us got lamb keema dosa, 1 winter uttapam and 1 paneer and peas dosa. My wife and I thought the sambar was very good. The keema was a bit too rich for my kids. The paner dosa was...ok as was the uttapam. The chutneys were again great.For main dishes two of us got Tamil lamb and two chicken kormas. All came with lemon brown rice. The rice tasted good but had the texture of boxed rice. I know it wasn't brown basmati, I make that weekly, the grains were too short and didn't open up. It probably was mass produced premade bagged rice which was doctored up in the kitchen with some lemon and herbs. The evidence for this assumption were the pieces of heavy duty plastic bag in my younger daughter's rice. It was the crimp top of the bag.The chicken was just ok. I really liked my lamb but my wife also said just ok.It appeared that this was too late at night for the captan as he had disappeared shortly after our mains appeared. A different waiter asked about desserts.I ordered payasam halwa. They were out of that. So switched to the rasmalai. My daughters got pear sorbet and coconut custard. These took another 15 minutes to arrive. Lost ticket again? Note we had a 9pm reservation and didn't get out of there until 11:30.About the captain and last waiter. I guess management thinks inattentive no personality, mumbling captains are what they are looking for. The late night shift waiter was a tad more personable.I waited tables to put myself through grad school. If I wasn't getting something from the kitchen I was always in the dinning room. It appears that waiting on tables was an imposition on the wait staff as I rarely saw the captain in our dining room. Also I expect that in an upscale resturant that unlike the local diner waiters will know who gets what. Not &quot;who's getting this? Ok I'm a bit demanding when I spend $250 on dinner for four without alcohol! I don't mind paying the money if the food and service commanded that.I'd be remiss if I didn't talk about the decor of the resturant. It was beautiful, very upscale and hip. The music wasn't ragas, which I'm good with. It looked like the restaurants in the five star hotels we stayed in in India. The food wasn't close. The only 5 star dishes served were the chutneys.I can't wait to go back home to Connecticut and get a great Indian meal for less than 100 without even going as far as into Jackson Heights.

I had dinner at Dosa with several colleagues most of whom were originally from India. Dosa was a favorite of one of my party and so we drove downtown which was a bit out of the way since we were staying out by the airport.There were 5 of us and we did not have reservation so we decided to sit at a long common table in the bar area which was very comfortable with plenty of room. The decor was eclectic, modern with traditional Indian touches. There dining room is open to the bar area , the table are spaced nicely and the high ceilings add to the feeling of spaciousness.We ordered several appetizers some better than others. I think the veggie sliders were the best. I had a spicy lamb dish and ordered Dosa as a side. The Dosa was great and the lamb was very good. The service was attentive without being intrusive. My colleagues enjoyed there meals as well. As the name would imply, do get the Dosa even if you need to order. It as a side.This is a relatively upscale Indian resteraunt and the food is priced accordingly with most entrees in the $25 to $33 range.

They were thoughtful: they threw in a free appetizer because we had to wait 30min despite a reservation. The other appetizers we ordered were exquisite...the eggplant poriyal one of the best ever. We were really getting warmed up to the restaurant. The service was great and so was the ambience. Unfortunately, all the main entrees were barely average. That included the Chana Bhatura, the Rava Masala Dosa and the Onion Utthapam. They need to pay a visit to Saravana Bhawan to learn how to make good dosas (and chutneys too). And since Dosa was the name of the restaurant, it was pretty ironic. But the rasmallai was great. The main reason for the average overall rating was that for the first time in 2 years, both my wife and I woke up that night with fairly severe acidity.... that was unexpected sadly.

DOSA is a must stop for us in San Francisco. For one thing, if you need to be gluten-free, as my wife does, you can relax and let your waitress or waiter guide you through the myriad of tasty, creative choices. I absolutely love the unique white truffle DOSA. But there are so many wonderful dishes here the best approach is a community meal where everyone at the table contributes a favorite or something they wanted to try. Because this popular restaurant often gets slammed, the service can be a bit slow. But the staff rarely errs. And big-time kudos to the hostess who thoughtfully called us when we were running late for a 2 o'clock reservation to let us know the kitchen closed for lunch at 2:30. This has never happened to me, and she literally saved our meal experience as we hustled over.

I had the Mint Lemonade and my friend the South Indian Monsoon - we both sighed with happiness on the first sip. Then she got the Masala Dosa and I got the Egg Poriyal Dosa. They're HUGE portions, but every bite was delicious, especially with the different sauces and the sambar. Prices are great too. Also a very sustainable restaurant if you look on their website. Waitress was very informative and friendly. Definitely a new favorite.

We dined here during Dine About Town week. the special menu was an incredible bargain. The first course scallops were the tastiest and best ever. Each dish was artistically and palatably presented. The spicy dosa was fantastic, including the sauces and soup accompaniments. Manager Todd J Smith added to our enjoyment by explaining each dish, including a history of its Indian regional background, the ingredients and how the dish fit into Indian family culture. I highly recommend Dosa and we will definitely return.

We landed at this restaurant in the afternoon for lunch when customers were just trickling in.The ambience was different from other South Indian resturants in the Bay area. The restaurant offers both a la carte menu and Vegeterian /Non Vegeterian Thali. It offers variety of Dosas which include traditional Masala Dosa, besides White Truffle Masala,Lamb Keema, Organic Greens, Spicy Basil etc and all other South Indian delicacies like Upma,uttapa,Idli,Vadas and much more.. We ordered Kesri dosa which has green cardamom and jaggery. My daughter ordered Mimosa, while my son in law ordered Wry Rajah, a hot/spicy cocktail having a blend of whiskey,orange rind,bourbon licorice. The side dish of Pakoras made of crispy Kale,chickpea and rice batter was delectable along with its tamarind and jaggery chutneys.We also enjoyed Halwa payassam. It was a great stuff. The restaurants also offers small plates as well as glutten free dishes.The serving staff is prompt and courteous and the tariff is commensurate with the taste and service.

Stumbled on this restaurant by chance. Couldn't find parking anywhere and stumbled on a parking garage in just around the corner from this restaurant. When we got out of a car we asked a resident of the neighborhood what his favorite place was, and this was it. My group of friends was not familiar with anything on the menu, so we had our Russian waitress order 4 dishes for us. Every dish was amazing! Serving staff were prompt and friendly. While most other restaurants on the street had a couple people eating, this place was packed by 7pm. I'd recommend reservations. We finished our meal with a nice spicy chai. Everyone in our group was impressed with the whole experience.

This outstanding South Indian restaurant offers an extensive menu. Half is dosa or uttapam dishes; I did not know about these dishes before, and the variety and tastiness surprised me. For you Celiac's patients who can't have gluten, dosa and uttapam are gluten free breads made from fermented lentils and rice that make Dosa my Celiac-wife's favorite restaurant. The other half of the menu includes small plates and main courses ranging from lamb chops to vegetarian curry. The sprouted mung bean salad is to die for. Warning, south Indian cuisine can be spicy--e.g., the sambar served as a dipping food with the dosa and uttapam. If you don't like spiciness, ask your server how spicy, and if it can be prepared less spicy. We love this place.

Avoid the Tasting Menu

Overall this seems to be an OK resto. Pleasing decor and a courteous if not friendly welcome. We ordered the tasting menu - always a bit of a crap-shoot and we lost this roll. The food was very good but universally very spicy - three courses with no let up in the heat department were too much for a couple of our group (we were six). We compounded our error by ordering the wine paring offered with the tasting menu. The staff serving the wine was not knowledgeable about the wine served and if what was given to us is indicative of the wine list at this resto, bring your own bottle if you want to eat here. The cost (without coffee or dessert - but including a 20% mandatory service charge that they tacked onto the bill) was about $80 per person, which seemed excessive for the quality of the dining experience offered.

We made reservations here because it was my teen daughter's birthday and she chose this place for her birthday dinner. When we arrived we reminded them of the special event and asked to sit at one of the two empty tables near the window on the main floor. The hostess neither smiled at us, nor said &quot;happy birthday&quot; as one would expect. Instead she rudely dismissed my request stating that those tables were &quot;reserved&quot; and that we should sit in their upstairs area. I am quite done with restaurants that have fake &quot;reserved&quot; tables that they either give their regulars or VIPs or no one in particular just not to you. By the way, one of those tables remained empty during our entire meal. The other was taken by two women on a table of four (and we were four people). We were marched upstairs and I took one look at it up there and said I would not enjoy dining there. I looked down and noticed several other empty tables and pointed to one and told her I would like to dine there. We did. The evening from my perspective was not starting well.The waitress was cold. No smiles. We ordered a bunch of food. My main fish dish was recommended by the waitress. The place was super crowded and the music much too loud. The wait staff constantly grabbed things off of our table with their hands and sleeves rubbing against our plates and food. Ugh. The food was average and overly spiced. I did not enjoy the fish. I felt rushed. I will not be back.

Just took my kids to Dosa on Fillmore last night for dinner. I like the open modern feel of the place. The music was a bit loud and the tables are a bit too close together and I had to listen to the conversation of the men next to us. I came here because I heard that they had gluten free items. The allergy menu lists &quot;wheat free&quot; items but should really clarify &quot;gluten free&quot; since they are not the same thing. I had a nice waitress and asked her for suggestions for mild dishes. She basically said that they didn't really have mild dishes. The chef/cooks make things their own way and refuse to make changes to their food for customers who prefer things on the milder side. Perhaps this explains why a large portion of the customers were Indian.I ordered the Masala Dosa and it came in a gigantic pancake with the potato part hidden in the middle. There was a soup to dip the pancake in. The soup tasted good but was much too spicy for me. The potato part was tasty but with a kick. Not as good as the masala dosas my friend, Meena, used to make but pretty good. Next I got vegetables fried in a gluten free dough. I didn't enjoy them. My daughter got chicken biryani (which can not be made less spicy or else I would have ordered it). It comes in a bowl with chicken legs still on the bone. I tasted the rice and it set my tongue on fire. My daughter ate it but we went through two bottles of mineral water. She said it cleared up her sinuses. The only part my son and I got to enjoy was dessert. We had the mango pudding which was wonderful. My daughter had cake that she liked. I would come back for dessert only. If you love super spicy food this is your place. They use good ingredients and therefore expect to pay a lot more that your usual local Indian restaurant. Our bill was over $100.

What a place this is... great food, excellent service, and worth the wait!My wife and I went to Dosa in February without a reservation, and were told there's a 45-minute wait. We heard how good this place was though, and decided to wait --&gt; excellent decision. Our server was extremely helpful and recommended a few dishes to us.We started with a special brussel sprouts dish, which was delicious. I also had an order of pekoras. For the entree, my wife had an uttapam, while I had a dosa. We both loved our dishes so much! So tasty! They have a lot of options for vegetarians and others with dietary restrictions -- my wife and I had no trouble finding something good!Since it is a little pricey, I'd recommend it for special occassions.

This is not your typical Indian restaurant. The menu is very creative, so you have spinoffs on typical Indian dishes, often with non traditional ingredients. There are also some typical Indian menu items that frequent diners to Indian restaurants would know about. The portions are appropriate, so you could easily be full with one entree, but could stuff yourself with an entree, &amp; splitting an appetizer &amp; dessert. The menu's core is South Indian but some North Indian dishes are offered as well. They do not have traditionally associated with other regions of India such as Gujarat. Vegetarians &amp; vegans will not have problems here as the menu has marked items &amp; the staff are familiar with ingredients as well.My wife &amp; I have had:Great beet croquettes, rava dosa, the winter uttappam, masala dosa, kale fritters, the 5 mini uttappam combo &amp; the desert rasa malai.3 things I do not like are:* tables are very close to each other so it can be difficult to hear the person in front of or next to you that you actually want to hear* reservations are hard to get, though you can walk in &amp; possibly get seated* the salt lassi drink was extremely thick &amp; salty.

DOSA clearly positions itself as a top of the line restaurant with prices to suit. Overall experience entertaining was positive although a little marred at the beginning when they forgot about our reservation entailing a 20 minute wait.Food is south India and different to what many Brits typically experience at home. Saying that, it is cooked well and different.Service is relatively prompt with attentive staff.Would recommend although be aware that prices are similar to those charged in some of SF's more expensive restaurants.

We made last minute reservations for a party of 4 to celebrate a very special 50th birthday on Saturday night. None of our party had ever been before to Dosa but we were all eager to try it. The service was excellent, and on a cold and rainy evening it was nice to be greeted warmly and given a table promptly. We were seated upstairs and told about some of the unique cocktails on the menu. The Peony is excellent and rather different. It is a gin based cocktail with coconut milk, curry agave nectar and was delicious. Guests at our table also enjoyed some non alcoholic cocktails and they were terrific as well. Very fresh and artisnal in the presentation. Our waiter was friendly, well versed on the menu and had terrific positive energy. He truly wanted to suggest things that we might enjoy. The organic yogurt appetizer with tamarind and lentils was a huge hit, and the shredded duck was delicious. Our favorite appetizer was the waiter suggested Chenai chicken, spicy and unique in flavor and presentation. We moved on to the entrees and the masala dosa is not to be missed. It is gigantic and the accompanying chutneys are our of this world. We also tried the halibut steamed in banana leaves with coconut rice, and an outstanding prawn Marsala. Each course was described, and served beautifully by the kitchen runners. We were impressed at how seamlessly the dishes were described, ordered, and presented. The only part of our experience as a disappointing lack of acknowledgement from anyone that it was a 50th birthday celebration. The reservations were clearly discussed with the Restaurant, and were made by phone to make sure this was known. The waiter obviously didn't know, when we checked in for our table there wasn't a mention of it, and when it came time for dessert there wasn't any mention of it. Since this was a milestone birthday it was disappointing to have it ignored by the staff.

Disclaimer: I'm not an Indian food expert.We went there for dinner last night. The service was pretty good. Food was interesting but was just okay. The dessert was very disappointing. If you come here, skip the dessert.The shredded duck appetizer was pretty good. Very spicy though. I ordered the White truffle dosa. (I'm a truffle addict. If I see truffle on the menu, I have to order it....) Again, it was interesting, but not something that I'd want to come back for it again.Other than the disappointing food, I thought the restaurant was a fun place to hang out. A great crowd and fun place to chat with friends and meet new people.My Indian friends told me that the price of the food here is ridiculously high. I thought for a dinner in this kind of setting, it wasn't too bad. I had a drink, an appetizer, a dosa and a dessert. The bill was about 50 bucks.

I was told that to eat 'Vada Pau', an indian snack food, you have to visit Dosa on Filmore. We were not disappointed, not only was the vada pau so good, their specialty was the dosa, that was good too. I would recommend Dosa on Filmore to all indian food lovers and a must when visiting San Francisco. For us, one visit was not enough, we had to go again.

This place was terrible. I guess you folks that give this place a good review don't know what good food is.. Whey overpriced, tables too close, constantly getting bumped by workers or guests. Great the crepes fill the plate but are empty on real food. All ambiance, but that's what people like to pay for, go eat there. The little food that we ordered was not all too good either. Had to order pizza to fill our appetite, what a waste of money. Never again....

This is one of my son's favorite restaurants and so it's perfect for him to celebrate his 28th birthday at Dosa.I made reservations on line a few days ago which worked out perfect. The reservations were confirmed by a staff member calling me to confirm. She actually called me 2 times until she spoke with me.When we arrived the staff had been notified this was a birthday celebration. We wanted the birthday celebration to be a surprise which it was. In the end, my son's dessert was brought to him and his girlfriend with a birthday candle.The food is excellent and the waitress was willing to explain the entree's or answer questions. This was my third time eating at Dosa and every time the food is superb. We will be going back to eat there most definitely.The ambiance is very relaxed so it's a great place to enjoy your food while taking time to enjoy whoever you are eating with. The decor totally suits the restaurant with an Indian feel.

What a wonderful Indian-inspired restaurant. I say inspired, because it takes traditional dishes and freshens and lightens up many, to great success. I enjoyed a seasonal watermelon salad that was genius, with just the right amount of Indian heat and some tasty cubes of paneer among the mung bean sprouts. Samosas, a staple anywhere, here have a delicacy I don't recall having before. Their &quot;idli fries&quot; give potato frites a run for the money. Their bar has some noteworthy choices as well such as the not-too-sweet peach-based vodka cooler. And the two desserts we tried, the coconut custard cake and the mango pudding were just great. Again, not too sweet as is often the case in India, but refreshing and sophisticated instead.

Enjoyed a really tasty meal here on our holds. Very pleased to find South Indian food as had to come by in Cumbria. OK, it may not be absolutely pure south Indian (veggie sliders!) but the contemporary American twist worked well for us. The food was flavoursome with a healthy but not overpowering heat. There was an excellent choice for vegetarians and the portions left us too full for desert. Our waitress was incredibly friendly and helpful, making recommendations and explaining menu items to other diners who were unfamiliar with this type of food. It's on the pricey side but we thought it worth every cent - wish we had something like this at home instead of the usual mass-produced, greasy indistinguishable rogan-madras-balti fare.

Don't know what the hype is all about. Popular with young Indian crowd. The food is average at best. Not worth the money or the hike to the place.

I've been to India several times for work and have always enjoyed Indian food since I was a kid, so this wasn't my first Indian meal (i see a lot of reviews that start like &quot;I've never had xyz before, but ...&quot;). This time we went here with some Indian friends who recently relocated from the Bangalore area to the Bay area of CA. Their claim is that these are the best Dosas they have had outside of India. I had to agree and that I thoroughly enjoyed everything else too. The Biryani had a nice flare and was very tasty. A great meal option in San Fran.

I loved this place. It's kinda upmarket for Indian, but had a great bar we could sit at while waiting for a table. There were Indians dining ( as well as American suits) which is always a good sign, and it was recommended so gave it a try. We shared lamb curry and pea and paneer dosa. Plus rice and raita. Both yummy, not too spicy though. They have wines by bottle and glass, beers, and the 2 Indian guys at the next table recommended the cocktails and desserts. Desserts are really sweet! (Indian boys said not asSweet as in India :)). The room was buzzing and had a good feel even though the ceilings were high and not usually cozy. I'd definitely go there again. They have another location in SF but was told this one is better.

Love the dosa's, so many varieties, we had the potato with basil, also the one with collard greens and other veggies, so good, ordered extra potato stuffing as well because the collard greens didn't have potatoes inside, still very delicious! The condiments were perfect compliments; also loved the decor, atmosphere and ambience, the place was buzzing with good energy! We started with the lamb meatballs, really good and saved some to eat with the potato and basil dosa, we mixed and match as you can tell from my review, fun to be creative with food!

This is a very popular restaurant that specialises in Southern Indian food. The problem is that it's very stylish in a Euro-American way and lacks genuine warmth and atmosphere. The portions are small and it is quite easy to make a mistake and order something rather boring as the staff don't really help. The night we were there they seemed very stretched and forgetful of what we had ordered. The desserts were good but insubstantial - don't even think about sharing !

We have stopped at Dosa on just about every trip to Japan Town, typically for a cocktail and a small plate or two. This time we had dinner there, and we were not disappointed. The atmosphere and decor is fantastic, from the huge artworks, to the epic light fixtures and the largest brass Shiva Nataraja I have personally ever seen - magnificent!We enjoyed the spicy basil dosa, and some chicken and fish dishes. The house label Cabernet was quite good and worth the asking price just for the experience. It paired very well with the spiciness of the Indian dishes - something that one might not expect from a cab.The service was top notch. We sat along the side of the restaurant where there are many tables-for-two. It might seem too close at first, but we ended up having fun engaging our neighbors in conversation and laughter. The place was filled with couples and families - many Indian - enjoying this superb venue.Dinner for two - including the bottle of wine - cost approximately $100, a fair price, all things considered. Dosa will continue to be on our list of places to eat when we are in the city.Cheers!- Rodney

Being joined by colleagues from Bangalore, I asked my hotel concierge for an India restaurant recommendation so I could take them to dinner, and Dosa on Fillmore was suggested. When we arrived, the place was really busy (Saturday evening), which seemed a good sign. The menus were handed out, and immediately I thought 'not much choice here, and wow - the prices are crazy'. We ordered - Lamb Kofta (good) and Chennai Chicken (looked and tasted like something KFC would serve up) for a starter. Followed by a fish dish and a lamb dish for mains, along with an egg dosa and bread. The lamb was quite nice, but nothing special, the fish was average, the dosa tasted 'authentic' but the deep fried bread was vile. The acid test was the question I alked my colleagues - would you eat there again. Answer - Only of there was no other option!

This is the best Dosa place I have been to in US and in ages to be frank. This is the pure South Indian cuisine restaurant I have visited in a long time. The ambience of the place is good.I went there with my family and oh boy I felt that I made the right decision. We ordered Rawa Masala Dosa, Vada Sambar, Masala Dosa and Uttapam. The dosas were crisp and well cooked. The quantity of chutney and sambar was also good. I always wanted to have a good Rawa Masala dosa and I am happy to find this place after 2.5 years of stay in US on my maiden trip to SF. I would definitely recommend this place. They have a good variety of Dosa, Uttapam in there menu and hope to visit this place again in near future.

Had been trying to visit DOSA for quite some time and finally went on Sunday of Memoral Day weekend. We were seated promptly upon our arrival (highly recommend having a reservation) and we had a great server. Although it took him a few minutes to greet us, once he said hello he was extremely helpful, attentive and offered honest recommendations (Orville is his name). All four of us had the seasonal tasting menu and not one dish disappointed. The drinks were also very good. Flavors are bold and strong (it is Indian food, after all) which I really like since I enjoy spicy food. Decoration is great as well with soft lighting and great light fixtures. Highly recommend this for locals and tourists.

If this is an Indian restaurant, it is like no other. The large space is your venue for a very special dining experience that includes a whole lot of foods that you never heard of but become your favorites instantly.

This is my second visit to Dosa on Fillmore. Dramatic, beautiful space. Surprisingly not as loud as I thought it might be on a Friday night. Sat at a table in the bar--my favorite place. Must try their cocktails--exotic, masterfully blended. Even make their on tonic water! Mung bean salad, spicy, generous and superb. Trumpet Mushroom Uttapam, Seasonal Vegetable Curry--outstanding. Can't get enough of Idli Fries. The coconut sorbet with toasted shreds of coconut was terrific. Ask to see the menu explaining the various dishes. What's vegan, vegetarian, gluten free, too. Plenty to satisfy those desiring meat. Will definitely return.

i am an indian, a south indian. If you are looking for the best south indian food around, take a cal train to sunnyvale. That is where you get truly inspiring authentic south indian food.This is decent south indian food and is located in an area more accessible to tourists. The cocktails were very good. service was good.reserve a table if you are going there in the evening/night. The food is decent. If you are an indian you will probably agree that there are better places out there in SF though the food was not bad at all. Having said that most of these places do not have the same level of service/ambience. For non-indians i would think this is a pretty good place to get a feel of south indian food in a restaurant with excellent service.

Stopped in for an afternoon snack on our way to the Sundance Kabuki movie theater. The lower section of the restaurant was 1/2 full. We sat at a little table near the bar, nice comfy arm chairs. The service was friendly. We had our 11 yo daughter with us who did not order anything and sat and read her magazine while we ate, no one seemed put out that she did not order. My husband and I tried a sampler of little pancakes (forgot the name), a kale/cabbage/mint/cashew/pomegranate salad, a chai tea and a kingfisher beer. Although we tried only a few items, they were delicious and presented beautifully. The chai was very good, spicy more than sweet. Prices a little high, but I think you pay a premium for the location and high style decor. Very beautiful interior, high ceilings, a very pleasant place to sit.

I enjoyed Dosa's upscale interpretation of simple south Indian dishes. I tried the tasting menu: lamb meatballs, a dosa full of greens, and coconut curry shrimp.

Went for dinner without a reservation; Anastasia at the door was very pleasant and accommodating; offered quick seating at the &quot;communal table&quot; or wait longer for a table; we waited and sat upstairs. Service is very good and the server was very knowledgeable as far as the dishes and the wine. I eat only gluten free and he brought over a menu with allergen warnings. We took the 3 course dinner with wine pairing. Portions are small but added up to a nice meal; we forgot to order &quot;not spicy&quot; and it was a little too hot for my taste. At one point a knife fell from our table and very quickly it was picked up and a new one appeared. We also wanted to change the cutlery mid-way the meal and left them on the plate; they were taken and clean ones brought. I would have liked a little more sparkling wine variety on the menu (only 2 choices). We also noticed that both owners (or maybe managers) take turns to stand upstairs and watch over everything. The restaurant runs like a well oiled machine.

Lots of choices, went there with vegetarians. Small plates are great, especially the fire soup. We ate a lot of different Dosa's and Uttapam. The food was all prepared well and spiced lightly (a little mild for me, but certainly not to most - - the masala was particularly too mild). Tasted a few of the spice route cocktails, some pretty interesting mixology. We had a large group and shared a lot of different dishes. Overall the food was good to very good, particular attention seems to be paid to the authenticity of the seasoning - - traditional flavors and chutneys.

I was really excited to visit DOSA. It was quite a journey from North Beach to Japantown, &amp; we had been out doing touristy things all day in jeans &amp; tshirts which wasn't a good idea. I think we were the only ones with children but they're not small kids, they dine from the adult menu. However, the hostess seemed displeased, not sure if it was the children or our attire. There were many people in suits &amp; dresses. We were told it would be a 1 hour wait, it was. The food was tasty &amp; everything I had hoped for. I thought the selections, portions, &amp; prices were great too. That being said, I must say having kids &amp; wearing jeans does not mean you are poor or a bad tipper but I wouldn't return without wearing a dress.

Dosa is exquisite in decor as well as food. The service was tad slow on a Friday lunch hour but it was compensated with the food. And what a food it was!! The moong sprout salad had a fresh take on original and the dahi wada (pictured) plate was too pretty to poke a fork in. I had ordered green mango-paneer dosa and it hit it out of the park with exploding flavors. The accompanying chutneys seemed like they were made that morning, read FRESH. And yeah, the main ingredient in any South Indian restaurant-Sambar- was done just right with no mellowing down for the occidental and just the right spices for us natives. THE place to go if you're craving for south indian food with a flare for class and experiment without compromising taste. Atithi Devo Bhava!!

For someone like myself, I have had a lot of BAD experiences with Indian food. I blame myself for possibly ordering the wrong things.

For what you pay for, there was nothing that stood out about the ambiance, food, or service at Dosa. Poorly moderated ambient beats were consistently too loud, the food struggled to distinguish itself from far less-expensive locales, and the service was, for lack of a better word, &quot;meh.&quot;We got the seasonal sampler to touch on multiple dishes and an extra appetizer. Nothing stood out. In fact, the third entree course of lamb was particularly so-so; a true pity since I order lamb almost solely while dining out. The &quot;dosa&quot; was the most intriguing dish and probably the only thing I would go back for.The room itself is stunning and beautiful, but the conversation we tried to hold was in direct competition to the awkwardly loud music.Beer selection was quite varied and consisted of some gems. There seemed to be far more thought put into the drink list than the food menu.All in all, I have 5 other Indian locations I would suggest before Dosa, and countless more restaurants I'd rather suggest in the price range.

Went for dinner with my family on a recent trip to the area. The restaurant is on the corner of Fillmore, behind large, heavy doors. The restaurant has dim lighting, but the decor is uncluttered and modern.They had some interesting cocktails on the menu, which I had to unfortunately pass on. The dosas had a twist to the traditional combinations. I had a rawa dosa that had. Gwen chillies in the batter, giving it a slight bite. The paneer (cottage cheese) dosa was a little smaller in size than I had expected, but delicious.Another restaurant that is perfect to visit with friends and family.

I am from Mumbai, Wife is from Bangalore and Friends from Gujarat and Channai! We six visited Dosa this weekend. The place was packed on Sunday night at 7 Pm food, thanks to Opentable we got the perfect seating in the corner-booth.Well Service, ambiance, pace with we were served, all 5 starts by default. Every individual who serviced our table knew what the menu is all about, even when it comes to the french pressed Moksha coffee to end the evening in style.As a Mumbaite, I always miss our staple snack, Vada Pav. I must mentioned, in all the restaurants (mostly hyped once) I tried in the bay area, Vada Pav sliders at the DOSA is executed almost to perfection by the Chef. Not exactly Bombay style but the recipe has its own merits. Superb start to the dinner! We ordered various &quot; Virgin drinks, although Dosa has really good collection of sprits &amp; Bar. My fav. drink was Southern Monsoon. It is worth trying for sure.Now to the main course, we ordered variety of Dosas, Spicy Basic, Chile-Garlic, Moong dosa and so on. Different taste, very good presentation. Actually some of us felt that we are eating in some eatery in south India :) Sambar was chennai style, again fantastic! Uttapam moon Platter is amazing :)All in all it was wonderful evening spent with friends and some authentic, spicy indian food and some good fusion music tracks to increase the tempo for the evening!MUST VISIT!!!

Came here for a brunch with bunch of girls. And wow! this place is amazing. Might not be the most authentic indian place compared to other millions of places in SF.But definitely is pretty darn good. We had their little puris- it's a little balls of puff pastries that you get to break and put spices in to eat.Delish!Dosas were all very good too. The only disappointing this was the entree. Pineapple chicken curry- well it is not indian nor anything. It's just a dish with the least flavor. Over all, it was great. Just stick to dosa and other snack items.

When three close, food-snob friends recommended Dosa on Fillmore, and I saw it was on Eater's top 38 restaurants, I made a reservation. I wasn't disappointed. From excellent dirty martinis amongst the vibrant bar scene to spicy and savory dishes such as the duck vindaloo and the paneer and peas uttapam, Dosa on Fillmore delivers on flavor and fun. It's great for groups, especially among the culinary connoisseur set.

We had a weeknight dinner here - the place was still packed at 8:00 pm, so I would suggest reservations, even during the week. The food was good - although I can't say as memorable or differentiated as many of the reviews suggest; it tasted the same as many other good south indian restaurants I have been to around the country. The atmosphere, however, was significantly better than many. I really appreciated the documentary-style pictures on the walls. The addition of a hard cider to the beer list is certainly something I wish more places would do, and it was excellent.

DOSA is a must stop for us in San Francisco. For one thing, if you need to be gluten-free, as my wife does, you can relax and let your waitress or waiter guide you through the myriad of tasty, creative choices. I absolutely love the unique white truffle DOSA. But there are so many wonderful dishes here the best approach is a community meal where everyone at the table contributes a favorite or something they wanted to try. Because this popular restaurant often gets slammed, the service can be a bit slow. But the staff rarely errs. And big-time kudos to the hostess who thoughtfully called us when we were running late for a 2 o'clock reservation to let us know the kitchen closed for lunch at 2:30. This has never happened to me, and she literally saved our meal experience as we hustled over.

The lunch crowd was sparse, so the big dining area felt cavernous. But that didn't take away from our relishing the excellent cocktails and dishes that we ordered. This is a great place to be introduced to a style of Indian cuisine, which I'm pretty sure, many have never tasted (southern Indian cooking). This is not a curry restaurant. Lots of fresh vegetables, seafood, tropical fruit, spices, &amp; plenty of vegetarian fare... whatever is in season locally .... So the menu tends to change a fair amount (though the dahls amd dosa are constants). Friendly waitstaff that made sure our water glasses were not empty!

We had such a great meal here when we visited SF. Their menu is focussed on the eponymous &quot;dosa&quot; - a kind of large savoury pancake or galette-ish affair. They spread these dosa with all manner of delicious fillings, and serve them to you with a selection of delectable dipping sauces and chutneys. The atmousphere was relaxed and cosy; the service was crisp, friendly and very prompt and the bill was quite reasonable for fine dining in San Francisco. It can be hard to get a table if you're a walk up - so rather reserve a table. Definitely worth a visit. Yum.

4 of us went just walked into Dosa , as wanted a curry treat, no reservations, our table was not the best, but the food was really good. Though I wish they would spice it up a bit. The south where dosas come from , have a spicy tangy cuisine. This lacked. .they need to be a bit more adventurous with the spices. But all in all ,a good experience.a good atmosphere, very nice decor. And we will be back.

We came here for drinks before a movie (there's an excellent AMC cinema across the road) and decided to come back the following night for dinner, because the cocktails and bar snacks were so good.We shared a very generous starter of Chennai chicken. I almost never order chicken at restaurants because I'm quite particular about it, but this was incredible. The peony cocktail is heavenly, even though I'm more of a wine drinker.For mains, my husband had masala dosa and I had the paneer &amp; peas dosa. I've had some exceptional Indian food in my life and both our dosaa were amazing - also under $15 dollars! We ordered mango achar on the side and it was excellent too.The setting is classic and elegant without being pretentious. Our waiter was attentive but not too attentive. Overall it was a terrific way to spend one of our last nights in SF.

I'm glad that my food-loving manager and co-worker were along to help order as I have never had southern Indian cuisine before. Tika Masala out - Samosas and Uttapam in. We also shared three entrees - Fish Moilee, Tamil Lamb and Prawn Masala. All were good but the curry sauce on the Fish Moilee was out of this world. We had a side order of lemon rice but would suggest ordering a side of one of the breads to sop up all that saucy goodness. I'm not a dessert lover but the guys had the Pistachio Dacquoise w/ Chocolate Chile Mousse and I thought they might lick the plate!Last but certainly not least was the delight of a very well informed waitress. She handled our &quot;tortured ordering&quot; very smoothly and steered us toward selections that we loved.

Went here twice while on a business trip. I *REALLY* enjoy going to interesting restaurants that serve unusual cocktails - and boy there were some odd-ball mixtures here. They were good too! The restaurant is a bit noisy, but we had a group, so we fit right in. The food was great EXCEPT their interpretation of &quot;mild&quot; does not match my interpretation of mild. Several of our party ended up leaving unfinished food because it was too hot (spicy) to eat. I am not talking about shy anti-spicy folks either. Two members were Thai and they love spicy food - so they ordered just a bit of &quot;heat&quot; - and then ended up unable to finish it.Anyway, it would have been wise had the waiter made a true representation (or interpreted) what &quot;mild&quot; meant. In hindsight, I should have sent it back. So, so for the fun, the great cocktails - but tell your waiter to go VERY easy on the spices if you want to leave there with your tongue still attached to your head.

Just took my kids to Dosa on Fillmore last night for dinner. I like the open modern feel of the place. The music was a bit loud and the tables are a bit too close together and I had to listen to the conversation of the men next to us. I came here because I heard that they had gluten free items. The allergy menu lists &quot;wheat free&quot; items but should really clarify &quot;gluten free&quot; since they are not the same thing. I had a nice waitress and asked her for suggestions for mild dishes. She basically said that they didn't really have mild dishes. The chef/cooks make things their own way and refuse to make changes to their food for customers who prefer things on the milder side. Perhaps this explains why a large portion of the customers were Indian.I ordered the Masala Dosa and it came in a gigantic pancake with the potato part hidden in the middle. There was a soup to dip the pancake in. The soup tasted good but was much too spicy for me. The potato part was tasty but with a kick. Not as good as the masala dosas my friend, Meena, used to make but pretty good. Next I got vegetables fried in a gluten free dough. I didn't enjoy them. My daughter got chicken biryani (which can not be made less spicy or else I would have ordered it). It comes in a bowl with chicken legs still on the bone. I tasted the rice and it set my tongue on fire. My daughter ate it but we went through two bottles of mineral water. She said it cleared up her sinuses. The only part my son and I got to enjoy was dessert. We had the mango pudding which was wonderful. My daughter had cake that she liked. I would come back for dessert only. If you love super spicy food this is your place. They use good ingredients and therefore expect to pay a lot more that your usual local Indian restaurant. Our bill was over $100.

We made reservations here because it was my teen daughter's birthday and she chose this place for her birthday dinner. When we arrived we reminded them of the special event and asked to sit at one of the two empty tables near the window on the main floor. The hostess neither smiled at us, nor said &quot;happy birthday&quot; as one would expect. Instead she rudely dismissed my request stating that those tables were &quot;reserved&quot; and that we should sit in their upstairs area. I am quite done with restaurants that have fake &quot;reserved&quot; tables that they either give their regulars or VIPs or no one in particular just not to you. By the way, one of those tables remained empty during our entire meal. The other was taken by two women on a table of four (and we were four people). We were marched upstairs and I took one look at it up there and said I would not enjoy dining there. I looked down and noticed several other empty tables and pointed to one and told her I would like to dine there. We did. The evening from my perspective was not starting well.The waitress was cold. No smiles. We ordered a bunch of food. My main fish dish was recommended by the waitress. The place was super crowded and the music much too loud. The wait staff constantly grabbed things off of our table with their hands and sleeves rubbing against our plates and food. Ugh. The food was average and overly spiced. I did not enjoy the fish. I felt rushed. I will not be back.

Dosa is in a great location to grab a bite to eat either before or after a movie. Between the loud music , the loud chatter and hanging chandeliers I felt as if I was in an Indian dance hall. The tables are very close to each other. We ordered small plates and the mung bean salad was terrific. My grilled octopus was overwhelmed by the green chili sauce. My partners small plates of fried vegetables and a chicken dish were just ordinary. The restaurant was full and the other patrons were clearly enjoying everything. Perhaps not a good fit for us.

We ordered the small plates of soup or salad and entree. If what we received were the small plates, we couldn't have finished the regular portions. The mint lemonade was refreshing. The fire broth was tasty, but not as spicy as the name would indicate. The mung salad was beautifully arranged and bursting with textures and complementary flavors. I had the caramelized onion uttapam and my sweetie had the masala dosa. Both came with several dipping sauces, which were perfect. A very satisfying meal, for a very reasonable price.

Dosa is a fantastic restaurant. Big (but not too noisy), elegant, modern, with excellent Indian food. What initially brought us here (and continues to bring us back) is a separate Allergen menu. We have a Gluten and Tree Nut allergy, and Dosa's clearly articulated allergen menu helps us understand what is safe to eat. We would go here for mediocre Indian food because of this, the fact that the food is fantastic is a bonus. Location is great too, walk North on Filmore to reach the Filmore shopping district, and East on Post for 1 block to reach Japan town.

The ambiance was very pretty and beautifully decorated. The attention was poor, the girl didnt take much time to explain the dishes or to give us options. Whe told us the dishes were only spiced to give the food taste so I didnt worry the dishes would be too hot. However, when the food came it was too hot. I have had Indian food in many other places and it has never been this hot. They should tell you so that you can be prepared.

We had bad experience in the Dosa. The ambience is very good and it feels like a proper restaurant. We had to wait for a fair time before the person seating us took notice of us. She was very pretentious and so were the rest of the waiters. Food was very average and poor value for money.Doubt if I will ever come back here. Did not feel at home with snooty staff here.This is an American restaurant with food modified greatly to suit the American palette and do not expect good South Indian cuisine at all !!!

I saw Dosa on the KQED show Check Please. From watching the show, the ambiance alone made me want to go and check out the restaurant. When we got there, the place was packed and I did find the music to be a bit loud. However, the smell that hit me as soon as I walked in let me know that the food was going to be unbelievable! We ordered the tasting menu and had 3 courses. The spiced Pear and Avocado salad was amazing and the Chennai Chicken just melted in your mouth! The Dosa's came with 3 amazing dips and one was a bean dip soup that was to die for. Lastly, I had the Seasonal Vegetable Curry and my boyfriend had the South Indian Lamb Kofta which also melted in your mouth. Let me just say that by the time the 3rd course came, I was getting really full but I had to finish! :) By the time we were leaving the restaurant, we were already planning our next trip and have decided that we will break away from the tasting menu and we can't wait to dive in to the real menu!

How else can you associate South Indian food and a restaurant? Great name for a great South Indian restaurant to eat at. The pick of the evening were the Lamb Kofta and the Uthappams. The Dosas that went around looked mouthwatering. Tried dining yesterday, but it was jam packed. So was it today! And to top it all, finding an Indian was like finding a vegetarian in the Carribean! That's a statement for the quality of the place.1700 Fillmore, SFO.

Dosa on Fillmore is becoming my favorite restaurant in San Francisco. Being of south Indian descent, I have a very high standard for this food, and Dosa does not disappoint. The tasting menu is the way to go. Best uttapam I've ever had. The drink called the batsman had us scrambling for a recipe to recreate it at home. The service is solid and the ambiance is both beautiful and upbeat. If you love Indian food, especially the flavors of Kerala, this is a can't miss experience!

Dosa describes itself as Southern Indian Cuisine. I must confess I don't really know the differences between the different regions of India but what I got to eat was wonderful. The name of the restaurant is their most famous dish, Dosa. They serve it in different varieties from thin and crisp to thick fluffy. Besides Dosa they also have more well known Indian dishes which I haven't tried but from the tables around me it looked like these dishes were also prepared with style and people seemed to enjoy them. The restaurant itself is very modern with an Indian touch. Very positive was the natural light which came through the large windows. To wrap it up a great place to eat Indian food.

Went there for a group dinner with a set menue - family style.The interior of this place is fantastic. Great mis of hindu art, psycadelic arts, and photos from India. Impressive bar.The place was packed but in positive way, if you like some buzz.So the interior was quite promising, but then the food and service were only average.We ordered drinks and the waiter remained silent when asked for recommendations. We waited for quite a while and then not all of the ordered drinks arrived. Special requests (alcohol free cocktails) seemed a problem and the food did not seem to be ready so they stuffed us with a lot of starters that were not on our menu. I appreciate we were a big group but good restaurants deal with much better. The food was decent but nothing surprising and I did not think it was too authentic, but I am not realy in a position to judge that. The starters were plenty but the entrees were not enough for our table, so some people did not get their piece of chicken or fish. The deserts were quite boring also they sounded much fancier on the menue.Overall the place is okay, but certainly not nearly as outstanding as its interior designer.

We had occasion to visit the bustling Dosa restaurant on a Friday evening, didn't mind waiting for a table for nearly an hour but were really turned off by the way waiters carried food plates through the restaurant. They carried usually two dishes at chest level, pushing and shoving through the crowd, with the plates passing numerous folks standing around , no more than 15 inches under many, many noses and mouths. We saw enough of this to decide we didn't want our order being walked the gauntlet of germs and left. Maybe on a less busy night the food travels the civilized route, but unless they cover the food enroute through the crowds on busy nights, or unless you like a hefty side order of other folks exhalations, stay away.

We went to the Dosa on Fillmore as it was close to our hotel and we love to eat Dosas. It was upscale and attractive in decor. It was very busy but we got seated upstairs and enjoyed our Dosas. They were different than what we get in Vancouver. I think the paper Dosa is probably what we get at home, but it was fun to have something different. The chutneys and the sambar were very tasty too. We are vegetarian and I am gluten free, so Dosas are perfect for us. The restaurant was very pleasant and the servers very helpful.

The whole dinner took about 50 minutes and left a little disappointed - it seems more a fast food than a restaurant. We paid about 150 Dollars for 2 tasting menus and 1 dish for our daughter.

I have asked a friend of mine &quot;What is the best way to find out if an ethnic restaurent is authentic? &quot; and he said &quot;You will find out if it is authentic when there are more &quot;Desis(immigrants of that ethnic land)&quot; eating at the place than the adopted White guests in the restaurent.This is perfectly true of this restaurent where you will find more White guests than Desis and this restaurent is not authentic in any way. All you get here is overpriced garbage served in the name of good Indian food and the place is too noisy to enjoy your dinner.The Dosas are sour and greasy, the Vadas are served with pungent and salty Sambar. I do not know why they serve Chutney with the Idlis or Vadas. There are no spoons or forks available. When we asked for some Salt and Pepper shakers we got two tea cups - one filled with salt and another with pepper.The Chcken butter masala had so much grease in it, I have almost vomited on my way out.The secod time I visited with my friends I have ordered Duck masala and that was a big mistake. No one orders Duck in an Indian restaurent as Indian chefs dont know how to cook duck. But in my case the duck served was actually 3 chicken legs overcooked and frozen a week ago and thawed and served almost cold, with a hot gravy spilled over it.The tables are small and there is no place to place the china or the cutlery.Absolutely the worst place to take your girl friend or business collegues for dinner and enjoy an evening.
