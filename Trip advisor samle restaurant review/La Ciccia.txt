Best Octopus

This is an ideal quaint &quot;off the downtown jaunt&quot; wonderful Sardinian cafe. Fits in perfectly with the idyllic San Francisco ambiance in suburban type setting. Servers all wonderful. We met the chef near end of night. He has innumerable ways he prepares his dishes. All excellent. Full of flavor and zest. The octopus hands down the best. We wished we had saved it for last, as we were unconsciously comparing all else served that evening to it. We will be back yearly. Hats off

We dine at La Ciccia every time we visit San Francisco and it never fails to be wonderful. The food is excellent, atmosphere warm and inviting and the management really cares about your experience. Although we may dine here once a year or less frequently, we are greeted like once-a-week customers by the owner. She is engaging, friendly and manages the operation with precision. It's a bit of a distance from the main tourist area but definitely worth the short trip for outstanding Sardinian food and a memorable evening.

La Ciccia is a small Italian restaurant in the Noe Valley neighborhood of San Francisco. Both the food and the service were very good. We stayed within walking distance, so parking was not an issue. It looked like people were bringing their own bottles, but you'll need to check on that. Although the food is not overpriced, you could save a lot bringing your own wine. Definitely recommend but make reservations.

I've been several times to La Ciccia and every time I go there is something new to taste-food or a wine from Sardinia. I love that. The last time I was there, treating friends, the service was not what I expected-we felt rushed and the server did not seem to want to explain some of the foods on the menu. It was very surprising as we had never had that experience there before. It might have been an off night for the server.That said, the food is always very good and we always enjoy hearing about a unique Sardinian food or wine that might be on the menu that night. Knowing that the sardines are in season and they are preparing it the Sardinian way. Or the saffron ice cream is made on the premises. Makes each visit a little surprise.

Located at the tail end of 30th street, in Noe Valley, this once little know restaurant has become a prized dining venue.We have been there several times, in parties of 2 to 6.Service is attentive. The cuisine is consistently well executed and typical of Sardinia (southern Italian): squid in ink, octopus, fish,... among other dishes.We love the place and will most certainly return.Note that the restaurant is &quot;smallish&quot; so reservations are strongly advised.

This is one of the best restaurants I have eaten at anywhere in the country. The food is exceptional and the atmosphere is friendly and cozy. My favorite dish has to be the Spaghittusu cun Allu Ollu e Bottariga which is truly wonderful. I have taken my wife on more that one special occasion and it is always a hit.

This Sardinian gem of a restaurant is located at the very end of Church Street and 30th street. The restaurant is small and housed in an actual brown-reddish brick house. You can't miss it. One thing I love about this place. They ask people to turn off their mobile phones. Finally some owners with common sense. We started off with marinated White anchovies and the octopus stew which was spicy and had a bit of a bite to it. Both were delicious. Since my ex-wife is Japanese she went with the spaghetti with fish roe (fish eggs) and she loved it. I don't like fish roe so I refused to taste it lol. I played it safe with the seared prawns with tomato sauce which were fresh and busrting with flavor. For dessert we had the ricotta and saffron cake with honey and almonds which was one of the best desserts I have ever tasted. Absolutely delicious. Enjoy the great food, atmosphere and turn of that noisy mobile phone before you walk through the door.

Attractive neighborhood spot with Sardegnan touches

La Ciccia has two things going for it: It is a neighborhood place in the best sense of the term: Loyal locals interact with welcome newcomers in an intimate space; and it features a number of dishes with a Sardegnan flair, something rare even in most Italian mainland cities. The staff are welcoming and attentive and the people in the kitchen know what they are doing. One weak spot for me personally was that, for someone who, for health reasons, is not allowed to eat spicy food, many of the menu items were off limits. This would not be a problem for most customers. The wine list is varied and the prices very reasonable.

This is where to get Sicilian food in the San Francisco Bay area. Period.The owners run it like they were inviting you to their own home for dinner. The food is always spot-on and the wine list will boggle the minds of those looking for obscure finds of delight. I've never had a bad meal there over the years and have had several that are just incredible. Check out the specials, or go with the mainstays. You can't go wrong at La Ciccia!Reservations are a must, often several weeks in advance

We just returned from our annual visit to the Bay area. A dinner at La Ciccia has become a part of our tradition. The food is authentic, fresh and perfectly prepared. The wine list is outstanding with many hard to find Sardinian wines and is fairly priced to boot. Ask the waiter for recommendations. You will be glad you did. I can't wait until next year. I just wish I didn't live 3,000 miles away.

Although you expect great food and service in San Francisco, there are restaurants that are stunning. La Ciccia, an Italian eateries located on the edge of Glen Park, is one such restaurant. The restaurant is far from North Beach but it is well worth a Uber ride if you are a tourist. Founded ten years ago by an Italian couple, the small dining room boasts food that exceeds 99 per cent of Italian restaurant. The chef owner is Sardinian so the restaurant carried the seafood and terrain emphasis of his native cuisine. The pastas are mostly homemade and the portions always ample the fish is extremely fresh and usually simply prepared. The wine list is surimi fly large, perhaps 200 offerings including Sardinian vintages, for a restaurant this small. Reservations are a must. But it is worth a trip

A friend recommended La Ciccia, a slightly out-of-way Sardinian Italian restaurant (30th &amp; Church St), and we were most impressed by the cuisine and wine selection. It's a smallish restaurant that does three seatings nightly. We were allocated the 5.30, while the last is 9.30pm. That doesn't seem to matter in Sanfran. A family atmosphere and authentic, original menu for that special occasion... I could go on!

La Ciccia never fails to satisfy on all counts. Lorella always welcomes everyone as an honored guest (the first time) or a family member (every time after the first!). Massimiliano manages to make wonderful authentic Sardinian dishes with the freshest ingredients and a postage stamp sized kitchen. And the staff is a happy bunch - especially Petra. It is just quite simply a slice of Sardinia transplanted to the end of Church Street - a treasure for all who experience it.

Four of us ate here for dinner and there were three highlights: the Sardinian Flat Bread, the Octopus in a spicy red sauce and the artisan gelato. I would definitely order these three things if you eat here.The restaurant is small and run by a couple I believe. They are very &quot;hands on&quot;, from cheerfully taking our reservation to seating us. Our waiter was wonderful, friendly and informative.We ordered three pastas and fourth dish with sea urchin. My fettuccine was good, the spaghetti in oil was good but I am not a fan of the third pasta, squid-ink spaghetti, I would not recommend it. One dish with the sea urchin had a very strong sea flavor and we did not finish it.I wasn't inspired by fhe dessert menu but then I saw the waiter serving the gelato. It was a plate with three small servings and they looked like they would be good-and they were! One of the gelatos so was goat milk based and was so delicious. I am so glad we ordered it.

Fancy, Shmancy Menu

The location is in a very nice neighborhood and the outside is unassuming. As you enter, you realize it's not particularly large, yet they manage to fit relatively comfortably about 15 tables. By 6:30, it was packed.The waiter is bona fide Italian and the menu is selective and authentic. They provide the titles of dishes in Italian, with English in parentheses. Of course,it's the type of menu where I don't know at least one of the things in the description, so I might as well read it in Italian.There are like 4 choices of everything - appetizers, salads, pastas, main courses, deserts.My sister ordered something minus all the stuff. The waiter commented at that point it's just pasta and butter to which my sister said &quot;exactly&quot;. She eats nothing. She went crazy and had some cheese on top of it.My future brother-in-law had the baby octopus stew as appetizer and I don't recall what for the dinner. Wife had a salad and then the baby octopus stew as her meal - apparently this is the specialty there. I had a greens salad (wife said it was outstanding, I was just okay with it - go with her view). And I had the lamb. The lamb was very good in my view, amazing in the view of my wife. Go with her view.Nice wine pairings (all Italian) and two desserts. All for about $230 before tip.I learned they don't offer gluten free pasta, but if you call a few days before your reservation they can try to buy some from the store. Others bring it with them!Hard to argue the service was awesome. I could easily skip going to this restaurant again, as it's too fancy for me, but my wife thought it was amazing. Go with her view!

La Ciccia is one of the best restaurants in San Francisco, and there are many from which to pick. The food is Sardinian, the menu is unique and each selection an experience. The Italian owners are warm and welcoming and are always there to ensure your visit is excellent. They have amazing consistency with their staff, which also helps to ensure your service first rate. It is not a large restaurant, making securing a reservation challenging, so if you wish to visit this restaurant plan ahead. It will be worth the effort.

We shared a calamari salad, then gnochetti, then pork medallions, then a semifreddo.

This is one of those typical small restaurants you find in SF. The tables are close together and it can be a bit noisy. They specialize in Sardinian food, which is mainly from the sea.We ordered a good variety of dishes and shared them &quot;family style&quot;. They had no problem accommodating us on that. Everything we got was very good. I particularly recommend the pasta with squid ink.

This is one of those restaurants that you hear a lot about and wonder if it really lives up to the hype -- it does.The food is phenomenal. I've never been Sardinia but after this meal, it's at the top of my list. Octopus stew was amazing and spicy -- as were both pasta dishes we had (the spaghetti and fettuccini with sea urchin -- both cooked perfectly and well spiced). The highlight for me was definitely the lamb -- perfectly medium-rare -- perhaps the best lamb dish I've had in the city. My only regret is that we didn't have room for dessert.The service is also phenomenal -- the staff is very warm and welcoming, and knowledgeable but disarming. They led my wife and I to a fantastic Sardinian wine for the evening, and also were very pleasant and prompt the entire night.All in all, a fabulous experience that made you feel that maybe you really were in Sardinia for just a few hours. We hope to try it again soon.

My daughter took me out for my birthday. The ingredients were all quite fresh and well presented. We shared a braised squid appetizer. Unlike the usually breaded and fried version, this dish was baked and served with a lovely sauce of vinegars and herbs.She had a lamb and veggies that was delightful...the lamb being cooked perfectly. I had a pasta with shaved dried fish and cheese. Both very good.We had a nice bottle of red wine from Sardinia that the server recommended.Good service and very good food.

Phenomenal Sardinian restaurant - excellent food, creative Salumi options and ample portions. I thoroughly enjoyed each and every dish. The home made pasta with Botarga (dried fish eggs) was sensational. The braised lamb shank was exquisite and just fell off the bone. The Porchetta salumi plate was more than we could eat, but made for a great addition to eggs the next morning.They have an extensive wine list they are very proud of. The sommelier was very helpful in helping us wind our way through the many Italian varietals to select the right wines for our dinner.My only gripe was that we left with a lot of food because we were not informed on the plate size - it would be very easy to order a la carte and have too much. Ask about portion sizes. Some dishes are better to split than take on by yourself!!

There is not a bad dish at this small, out-of-the way Italian, While it is not the largest menu and the tables are a little cramped, the quality and freshness of the ingredients plus the true southern Italian authenticity more than make up for these tiny annoyances. The menu changes often bit try the &quot;black squid ink pasta&quot; if one is featured on the menu. The wine list is also superb and features one of the larger selections of mostly (southern) Italian wines. Reservations are a must. One caveat: if your are looking for what goes as Italian cuisine in many places (ie chick/veal parm, pasta with meatballs, etc..), this place may not be for you but try the enatore Capelli Gnochetti Pork Bagna Pecorino Sardo instead.

Excellent food and service and a lot of fun--BUT, parking was a nightmare. There's only street parking and the night we were there I dropped off the rest of our party and drove around and around and couldn't find a place to park within 1/2 mile of the restaurant. Finally, I called my son and he got a waitress to move her car so I could park.Other than that, we had a great time. We asked our waiter for suggestions and everything was delicious. We shared appetizers, pasta, main courses, and dessert. Crowded and noisy but a lively, fun atmosphere.Be warned--on our way back to the highway for our return to San Francisco, we had to go through a police sobriety check point.

LaCiccia is best described as a culinary event. Tucked away in a Noe Valley residential neighborhood, this wonderful restaurant proved to be a great introduction to Sardinian cuisine. Based on the waiter's recommendation we ordered their pasta, fish and lamb signature dishes as &quot;pass around's&quot; for the table which proved to be the way to go. All dishes we well presented with incredibly fresh local ingredients and wonderful flavors. We paired the meal with Kanai Carignano Del Sulcis, a reasonably priced Sardinian red wine that that drank as well as a high end Sangiovese. This restaurant is a real gem. Make reservations early and respect the &quot;no cell phone&quot; request.

Never had Sardinian food before, so this was a novelty. It is a restaurant in my neighborhood, so I have eaten there several times. The food is excellently prepared. Unfortunately, it has been &quot;discovered,&quot; so it is now among the trendy restaurants to go to. Also unfortunately some people also bring their infants to dinner with them, a rising rend among the affluent 30 year old set in San Francisco who have settled into this neighborhood. Thus, better late in the evening if you don't want to be entertained by other people's children.

I live near here but haven't been for a few years.If you're visiting San Francisco getting here from downtown hotels gives you exposure to a couple of SF 'hoods. The J-Church light rail comes above ground for most of the trip and you'll ride up the side of Dolores Park affording great views of downtown (sit on LHS).Restaurant is small - maybe 40 covers? - and you're packed pretty close.Food is exceptional. Other reviewers have highlighted the various specialties but I would encourage paying particular attention to the specials - last night offered a veal tripe stew in a spicy tomato broth which was exceptional...Waitstaff - uniformly male, at least on most recent visit - all great and very knowledgeable.Pricing competitive for the experience - apps lo/mid teens; first courses hi teens/lo-twenties; second courses hi-twenties. Decent selection of exclusively Italian wines by the glass, with bottles beginning around forty dollars.

We had the octopus stew for a starter- it was swimming in a slightly spicy marinara sauce that was perfectly seasoned (as was the whole meal). Save some bread for the sauce. We split the pasta botarga and ordered the special: sea bass. We split a salad. The wine list is famous, and famously good- the hard part is deciding what to drink, but they have excellent advice. We were too full to eat desert, so we ordered the ricotta cake to go (OMG delicious later when we ate it) This place is tucked away in Noe Valley, but is worth the trip. Reservations are a must, and it is closed on Mondays and a few other times during the year, but you will be blown away by the food when you do get a reservation. Let the servers guide you in your food choices and wine- you will not be disappointed.

Awesome Sardinian items. If you are not familiar with Sardinian cuisine, make sure to ask for guidance, you might miss opportunities for amazing dishes. Among others, excellent tripes and pasta with squid ink and lemon zest. Only downsides: tables tend to be small and close to each other, and they do not carry a license for spirits (which means mirto is not available...).

Located at the southern edge of Noe Valley lies this treasure.

Make a reservation for this restaurant because it is is very popular.

Five of us each ordered different plates, including appetisers and dolches and all were exceptional. To nitpick a little, the bread is not up to San Fransisco standards so order the flatbread. Good wine list but we mistakenly let the waiter pick Our wine. Bad mistake!. We ended up paying over $70 for two bottles of Sardinian wine that retail for $10 each. Maybe they don't allow use of cellphones because they don't want people to google their overpriced wines. And this place is very, very noisy and elbow to elbow. Back on a positive note, their baked calamari is the best ever, their ice cream assortment is spectacular, the baked sardines are to die for and the service is above exceptional. Simply can not beat their food. The chef is a genius! An easy drive from the airport if you stick to the interstates. Ate there twice this past week and tasted almost everything on the menu.

On our recent visit to San Francisco, our daughter had made reservations at this Sardinia restaurant. WARNING--you must make these well in advance, but they will only make them a month in advance of you visit. You need both luck, persistence, and flexibility. The dining experience was worth it.Our group of 4 ordered the seafood soup and baby calamari as apprtizers--there was plenty enough to share for 4. We split 2 pasta dishes as a first course, and each of ordered a main course. A roast lamb tenderloin dish was done exactly right. A pork medallion with caramelized onions was very good as was the roasted sea bream. A ricotta saffron cake with honey and almonds topped off the meal. Note: the menu names are all in Sardinia dialect, but they all have English subtitles. The cost per couple with a nice Sardinia red wine blend was about 150 including tip.

We have visited SF before and are definite foodies. As we ask around about spots we should hit, La Ciccia is mentioned often as the #1 spot. This most recent trip found us just up the J train from La Ciccia so we had to check it out. We lucked out with a reservation the same day (possibly one of the only two reservations left according to Open Table). The reservation was right when they opened so we found ourselves waiting outside in beautiful weather with another group before it opened. The others were locals that frequent La Ciccia and line up so they can grab the spots at the bar (only 5 stools on my count).Our table was one of the few in the front windows and the place filled completely up 30 minutes after opening with what appeared to be many patrons very familiar with the place. Our server was very knowledgeable and our food came out in fifteen minutes (first orders out of the kitchen).I ordered the pork loin and my wife ordered the lamb. We ended up sharing quite a bit, both were the best of each that we had ever had. The vegetables that came with them had a great seasoning to them, one we hope to try to replicate at home! We topped our diner off with dessert and got the gelati. The chocolate hazulnut was delicous but our favorites were the goat cheese with fig and the marsala and raisin. Took as small of bites as we could so we could get as many bites as possible.The portions were perfect, we exercised a little restraint so we had leftovers for mother who was babysitting for us. We look forward to returning to La Ciccia next time and making sure mom comes along!

The BEST Sardinian food outside of Sardinia

Chef Massimo is truly an artist in the kitchen!!!! It is rare to find a Chef so devoted and involved hands-on in the making of every dish that comes out of the kitchen. I have frequently travelled to Rome over the last 40 and have not found Sardinian cuisine as good as La Ciccia in San Francisco. Massimo's adorable wife, Lorella, is the perfect counterpoint to the entire experience of dining at La Ciccia --- catering to diners as if she was entertaining friends at home. A very unique and original wine list, featuring outstanding Italian wines, provides the perfect compliment to a meal you will not forget.BRAVI MASSIMO E LORELLA!!!!!!

This is one of SF's gems. Husband and wife team serve incredible food from Sardinia. Don't miss the octopus stew, the roasted calamari or the risotto with sea urchin. The flavors are truly Italian in their simplicity and focus on flavors. The is truly one of the best Italian restaurants in the city.

I can honestly say this was one of my best meals and I have dined all over the world. Sardinian has much more flavor with much less sauce then typical Italian Each dish unique and surprising.Like the prawns.. very good but THE SMOKED Swiss chard underneath was soo soooo special..The service was fine... Our waiter from Genoa was good but after he took our order we mostly saw the kitchen staff.. They were great. Two things... the bread is cold (I like warm bread to soak up my sauces )and our dinner including two glasses of wine was 160 dollars before gratuity.... I wish I could dine here once a week but 90 dollars a piece would make this a special occasion place.. Also.. if you are not a local.. The 24th st BART is a good 20 minute walk... This is a must try restaurant.. I would have a glass of wine at home and save my dollars for an extra first or second course! Buon Apettito

Three of us ate family style and were delighted with our starters of fish stew, baby octopus, and a squid ink linguine dish, all generous portions. Then our main course of lamb arrived and I was sorry I had filled up on the fish stew, tasty though it was. The lamb was exceptional! Medium rare char-grilled slices that were tender and delicious and a very nice size portion for $28. Only the wine glass prices seemed high to me; otherwise it was very good value. Do try the ricotta cake (more like a pudding) for dessert. We loved it!

This is not what Americans expect of an Italian restaurant. This is truly Sardinian, from the language of the menu, through the wine list, to the food itself. The service is helpful ( something absolutely necessary to those of us who have not spent any length of time in Sardinia) and perfectly timed, the wine list is extensive ( and reasonable), and the food is perfectly prepared. If you think this place is expensive, price a trip to Sardinia. If you're in the mood for something deliciously different, make a reservation, skip lunch, and go.

You need to make reservations well in advance. Tiny little restaurant. We loved Monterey calamari, octopus stew and grilled sea bass. They have a huge wine list. We tried some Sardinian wines and they were good.Our waiter was great. He let us try 3-4 different wines before choosing the one we liked. Great little neighborhood restaurant.

You probably need to make reservations well in advance, since it's a pretty small place. But the food- excellent. It's the perfect mix of next-door nonna cooking and 'high palate' cuisine. All the essences of Italian/Mediterranean food are there, and yet it's much more. The Sardinian roots of the kitchen give the dishes a special twist (it's not Sicilian, as a previous reviewer pointed out- a big difference!). The seafood is spectacular and the pasta in squid ink was our favorite.

Make a reservation! The place feels up quickly, but if its just two of you you might be able to sit at the counter..Seafood lover paradise! Great octopus stew app, olive oil drizzled calamary, sardines...Amazing pasta , all is great, tuna heart one is my fav, but can be too fishy for some..Good wines and decent prices. Nothing too fancy, but nice romantic ambiance, friendly staff, family owned...Chef is very talented but humble , and if you sit at the counter you might get a chance to chat with him before it gets crazy bisy. If I could, i would eat there every day..Deserts are just ok, so need to save space for it...:)Parking can be found somewhere around the area...we usually are able to find a space.

This small restaurant serves delicious Sicilian cuisine, which is not the typical fare you'll find on Italian menus. I've dined here multiple times and have never had a bad meal. Their specials, esp. the Santa Barbara prawns are outstanding. The waitstaff are friendly and professional which adds to the overall experience of this beloved neighborhood gem.

I had heard of the Octopus Stew at La Ciccia and decided that I had to try it out. And, not only was it worth the trip, but the rest of the meal was incredible. La Ciccia is right on the Muni J line, at the Church &amp; 30th stop, easy to get to and find. Our server was friendly, knowledgeable, and right on with his recommendations. We shared three dishes - the octopus stew, which was tender and flavorful, fettuccine with wild boar and veal (truly incredible), and branzino, which was served as two tender and delightful fillets. It was a perfect combination for the two of us and our server recommended an Italian white wine which complemented the tastes and really rounded out the meal. La Ciccia is off the beaten track, but well worth finding and dining. We'll be back!

Wow, loved our dinner here so much. There were quite a few standouts in this Sardinian restaurant. And of course the menu changes. But if available, do not miss the squid ink pasta. It was exceptional. Equally amazing was the octopus stew.The waitstaff was attentive and very helpful. The restaurant small and busy, and can be very noisy. We had 9:30 reservations so as our dinner progressed, the crowd thinned and noise not a problem at all. Oh, the gelato -- BEST EVER. If you like and appreciate excellent food, go to La Ciccia!

Food portions are large here. Food is very simply presented but prepared with perfection. Food choices are limited, unlike the extensive wine list. This is not a very comfortable restaurant in terms of furniture or table spacing, and the service is a little bit sporadic. Don't come here for a private conversation or a quick in and out meal. Do come here for a great authentic no fuss Sardinian food and wine experience!

The woman owner/hostess was very accommodating. First, I screwed up the automated reservation and when I arrived at 5:30 pm , the reservation was not in their computer. Turns out somehow, it was made for the next month. But she seated us anyway. I Was very thankful for that bc the restaurant is filled later on. We ordered flatbread and when we saw regular bread came with the dinner, we asked the waiter if we should cancel the flatbread. He said no bc the flatbread was different and was really good. I'm glad I listened to him; thin, crisp, with hint of cheese and rosemary on top--5 Stars. Stewed baby octopus in spicy tomato sauce-tender-4stars. Baked calamari- tender but not as much taste-3 stars. Wife had pasta with pork and a slight sweet tomato sauce- don't know what else was in the sauce but was terrific-5 stars. I had squid ink pasta for the first time. It surprised me bc the pasta were little pin head pasta balls and sauce had a lemon taste- was so different and very good-5 stars. Relied on the waiter to recommend glass of wine to go with meal- perfect choice by waiter. Service and Food were wonderful. However, if you are looking for pasta, menu only had 4 choices. This is Sardinian restaurant and more heavy on seafood rather than pasta. If you want pasta, would go to Parma.

Just returned from 2 weeks eating pasta in northern Italy, and this meal stood up to any we had there. Baby octopus and calamari starters were superb, and the pasta and sauces were excellent. Very rich, and the Sardinian flavors were interesting. Great wine list. Would definitely recommend and return.

If you see the location: do not give up. If you see the facade: do not give up. If you see the interior: do not give up. Just choose anything (no not what what you already know) from the menu, close your eyes and enjoy!They have true original Italian/Sardinien dishes and extensive Italian/Sardinien wine list so be open for new gastronomical experiences. No not fancy, show off place to be, pure come for a tasteful evening out. You better reserve a table as its small and mostly fully booked.

I enjoyed this Italian adventure, having never eaten Sardinian food I was impressed. It is a bit out of the way, but worth the journey. The food was fresh and challenged me. The wine we drank complimented it well. We shared our plates 'family style' and that gave us a good mix of dishes. We all enjoyed it and left a little bit happier and more relaxed than when we arrived. That is what is meant to happen in a restaurant that gets 5*.

La Ciccia came highly recommended by Mike at the Prescott Hotel-he hit a home run!! The trip over on the church J line was like an episode from Seinfeld-lots of fun!! We Didn't have reservations and preferred to eat at the bar.Lenis, the hostess, was amazing-she told us it would be about 25 minutes, sent us over to Nebbia's for a glass of wine and called us when our seats were available.Lorelia, at Nebbia;s,was very friendly and took good care of us.At La Ciccia;s, we had the baby octopus stew -might be the best thing I've ever had! A spicy tomato sauce with tender, delicious octopus.The bottariga pasta was so good and the trio of gelatos for dessert were out of this world.Our waiter/bartender was the best and everyone was so incredibly friendly! Excellent wine list.It was definitely one of our all time favorite dining experiences!

Mar 13, 2014We had a memorable dinner with my brother-and sister-law, who had never been here either. Though I made advance reservations about a month ago, the owner, Massimiliano Conti, could not find my reservation. Despite that, we were seated; we were so looking forward to dining here.We had an array of starters, octopus stew, marinated calmari, and roasted sardines. All were divine. Our entree, squid ink pasta, was very different--the pasta was cut into short lengths that it almost resembled a blackened risotto. Their wine list is very extension. We ordered a $30 Tuscan melot-cab that was correct and full-bodied.Their food seems authentic, from Sardinian origins, and totally worth it. Once you have found parking, you're enjoy the evening.

Came here during a visit from NY, thanks to Trip Advisor reviews. Excellent food. The owner himself took our order and advised us on selections and wine. Gracious and personal service; robust and unusual renderings of iconic Mediteranean food. The food is Sardinian, rather than &quot;Italian.&quot;

It's at La Ciccia and it's Sardinian, as is the co-owner and chef, Massimilliano Conti. His co-owner and wife, the vivacious Lorella Degan is from Padua and does everything else, including selecting their wonderful Italian wines. Everything's fresh, carefully seasoned and carefully prepared, lots of seafood, wonderful pastas, lovely attentive wait staff. What more could one want? But wait! There is more. They've just opened another restaurant a few doors down the street on Church, La Nebbia, which serves Italian supper items, small plates if you will. Tasty little plates of various Italian meats, cheeses, delicious pizzas, even lasagna! Great wines, too. It's the drop-in enjoy yourself destination for neighbors and out-of-towners. Both restaurants are accessible riding the &quot;J&quot; line on SF's erratic and undependable municipal railroad system, which runs all the way from the Embarcadero to La Ciccia's and La Nebbia's front doors. If you want the scenic route, take the surface &quot;F&quot; car along Market, then switch to the surface &quot;J&quot; at Church. And there are always taxis and the alternatives: SideCar, Lyft, Uber and RelayRides. Get to either restaurant any way you can when you visit San Francisco.

Though this restaurant has been around for more than 5 years, this was our first visit with friends. Not only is this Sardinian restaurant &quot;authentic&quot;, both in the menu, but the preparation, and extensive wine list. You could say this is a &quot;Mom and Pop&quot; restaurant as the couple who own and run the restaurant are intimately involved with all aspects, from greeting, to serving, and food preparation. It's laid back in a good way, with the waiters relaxed enough to actually chat with you, and for the owners to pop out of the kitchen or from in front to ask how everything is. We really enjoyed the whole calamari, the pastas, and salads, as well as fresh fish. We look forward to returning for a night out soon.

We made reservations five weeks in advance, which is what it takes to get a table for two at this small, family-run restaurant. The effort is absolutely worth it. Chef Massimiliano Conti is uncompromising in re-creating the food of his native Sardinia. We sat at the bar, which offers a view of the kitchen and a chance to have a bit of conversation with the staff. When we asked the chef where he got the sea urchin and cured tuna heart served with fregola, he answered &quot;From Sardinia!&quot; Seafood is the big draw here. We also had the octopus stew, made with tomato and smoky peppers. Our friends in SF who steered us to the place said we'd leave with the taste of the ocean in our mouths, they weren't exaggerating. After oohing and ahhing over our third course, the chef came out and gave us some of his freshly made head cheese to try. It was one of the best things I've ever put in my mouth.There are some more conventional items on the menu, but for us the reason to eat at La Ciccia is to enjoy food we knew we were unlikely to find anywhere else.The wine list is phenomenal, with bottles from many small Sardinian producers. Lots of vermentino, cannonau (the Sardinian name for grenache) and Carignano.Our server was friendly and very knowledgeable.

This restaurant came highly regarded and my friends hit the mark. What an awesome dining experience from start to finish. The staff reminded me of any great neighborhood restaurant in Italy, something hard to come by in the Bay area. Great wines, food, service... a well orchestrated evening.Started with house made charcuterie that rocked. Two pastas really caught us off guard, they were so good. The aglio olio was outstanding with the battarga (fish roe) and the gnochetti with pork ragu made me want to order another one. Highlights on the secondi were orata and pork tenderloin. Probably one of the best wine lists for Sardegna and southern Italy in the area. One of my new SF favorites!

Fortunately La Ciccia is a little bit off the beaten path, otherwise you'd never get a table. Nevertheless, the two times we've visited this little resto it was packed. For good reason.On our last visit we showed up an hour early for an 8pm rezo and instead of being rebuffed, we were put at the bar and treated to full table service. Fine by us. We started with the Burrata special, a gooey, delicious cheese that oozed buttery notes all over our palates. Next up was the oven roasted Monterey Calimari that was tender, tasty and drizzled in basil oil we lovingly sopped up with the remains of our bread. Our last course was the Gnochetti with Pork Bagna, a meaty, to-the-tooth dish, cut with the sharp bite of year-old Pecorino.By the time we'd finished, there wasn't a crumb remaining, nor was there room for dessert. No matter...we'll be back.

After reading such wonderful things online about this restaurant I decided to visit it last night during my stay in San Fran. It definitely did not disappoint and was well worth the $20 cab fare from union Square! We had the octopus stew and calamari to start followed by the squid ink tagliatelle and pork gnocceti, all of which we fabulous! Portion sizes are very generous, had we realised this, we would probably have shared a starter and saved room for dessert! This is definitely a local restaurant but the owners were so welcoming! The lady even hailed us a cab after the one we had ordered did not turn up!

This is the neighborhood restaurant you would like to find. A nice cozy dining spot personnally run by the owners. Ambieance is friendly, professional and just a little cozier and closed in than I prefer. Food is great. This is my first experience with Sardinian cuisine, perhaps quite similar to Italian or Sicilian, with the emphasis on foods influenced by the sea. We shared the day's pasta as our 1st course which was a fettuccini tossed in a sliced artichocke sauce....excellent. One of us had the large grilled prawns, the other had the thinly sliced /breaded pork a la schnitzel. Both were very good. The flavors of the sauces again were excellent. We shared the riccotta cake for desert, nice, but not as memorable as the rest of the meal. This is a place I want to come back to to try other dishes offerred on the menu and to find the best they have to offer.

I saw a review of the restaurant on a local TV show and since the food is based out of Sardinia, I had to try it. My family in Italy camps on the island of Sardinia every year and I wanted to check out the food. We started with the calamari. Divine. That is all I can say. Cooked perfectly and the sauce was amazing; we didn't let them take our plate away until we could finish every drop of that delicious sauce. My husband asked what the base was for the sauce and they replied &quot;basil oil.&quot; It was so good, I won't even try to duplicate it. Then we had the fregola with sea urchin and cured tuna heart. Not our favorite as it was a bit too briny. We were glad we tried it, but we wouldn't order it again. I had a pizza bianca with sopressata and I think I might have eaten almost of all of it and it was big - the crust was just the right amount of chewy and puffiness and the sopressata had the perfect saltiness. My husband had the Hawaiian swordfish and although it was good, he didn't think it paired well with the beet greens also on the plate and the saffron flavor was a bit overpowering. We ended with the three gelati - goat cheese &amp; fig, chocolate hazelnut and marsala wine &amp; raisin (that was the best!). All in all, it was a very nice dining experience and the staff was friendly and helpful.

We started with the grilled Baby Calamari which was so fresh and tasty and cooked perfectly. Then we shared a pasta dish which was al dente made to perfection. I had the whole giant prawns which were cooked in olive oil with many fresh spices. My wife had seabass which was fresh and seasoned perfectly

When you enter the tiny restaurant somebody will greet you with a big smile and a friendly hand on your shoulder will escort you to your table. I immediately felt I am in the right place.The food is not the regular American Italian you find in 90% of the restaurants, this family owned restaurant serves food originated in Sardinia! I started with Octopus stew in a spicy tomato sauce which was perfect! the octopus meat was tender and not rubbery, perfectly seasoned and spicy. I cleaned the plate using the bread. For main I had one of the days special: pasta with rustic tripe stew. So simple, so authentic, so good. For desert the barman recommended the chocolate truffle which was a big scoop of chocolate ice cream filled with liqueur and cherry. You don't need more than that...Most wines are from Sardinia and are very interesting and reasonably priced. For me that was a perfect dinning experience.

La Ciccia was a weekly regular for us until they became so popular that we couldn't get reservations! Massimo and Lorella really know how to make magic happen, and we were thrilled to be back this week taking friends from New York. We are Italian (from Italy) and are very picky about pseudo Italian food you find in the US, but La Ciccia is authentic Sardinian. Don't miss the pasta with black squid ink, the octopus appetizer and the grilled calamari! We also love the pasta with shaved tuna roe (bottarga), and of course the crispy Sardinian bread (pane gattau). And, don't miss pairing it all with one of their fantastic Sardinian wines. So nice to be back!!

Not your regular Italian restaurant. Very special and unique dishes. The dishes were all great but not for everyone's taste. You have to be somewhat adventurous . The octopus in spicy red sauce, pasta with bottarga, lamb with saba and the anchovy salad were great.Noisy small place with excellent service and friendly atmosphere. It is obviously a local hang out -- difficult to get reservations. Ideal place for 3 people to share lots of dishes-i.e. 3 lambchops with the entree.

Unless she's from Sardinia! Having visited Italy several times you realize that there is no one Italian food , but rather many regional foods. This is authentic Sardinian food and not to be missed. I looked at the menu and if not for the many foodie lists and trip advisor raves , I may have been deterred. I wasn't and you shouldn't be either. The warm service and fresh ingredients make for a wonderful evening. Highlights were the octupus stew, speghetti with bottarga [ my non-fish eating wife was stealing mine}, squid ink pasta{ wonderful lemon flavor}, lamb with broccoli and sea bass with saba. Desserts were a wonderful safron cake with honey and goat cheese and fig gelato. The wine list has received a wine spectator award and our waiter after after questioning our likes helped girect us to a perfect Sardinian wine. It not an accident this is a rising ster on the SF food scene.

You think you know Italian; Sardinian is such an interesting offshoot. The chef has such a perfect touch with the seafood. Everything is a tiny bit different (in a splendid way) and its all a taste treat. Reserve and treat yourself to a seat at the bar sometime. Do not miss a visit to La Ciccia. The warm hospitality is also a part of the cuisine.

Well, this time we went with a group, and wow it was the way to go. What we all decided was to order a bunch of selections from the menu and we shared.So everyone got a nice size bite or more.We started with the star of the menu The Octopus in red sauce. Tender and the sauce was deep rich dark and so good you wanted more or to put it on other dishes. Next the calamari with basil oil. it was OK not great. Next a salad with all these micro greens and anchovy vinaigrette, delicious.Than the signature dish of Sardinia; Pasta with Bottarga, oh my God heavenly. Black pasta with squid ink and seafood, delicious (and don't be turned off by this its lemony and full of seafood). The lamb with Saba drizzle and Vegis, with a glass of red wine,oh yea. Fresh prawns splayed open and grilled with oil, garlic, and parsley; yet another hit. The Sardinian cheese sponge cake with Cappuccino made the gelato plate come in second.I am so glad we got to taste so many things in one night. If I went back I would get the octopus, the spaghetti with bottarga and if I could fit it the lamb.But there are other things on the menus to explore so I guess Ill have to go back a few dozen times. Im looking forward to going back&gt;&gt;&gt;soon.

For many years, this was a pizza place that did barely any business. That all changed when the owners of La Ciccia opened their restaurant that features the food of Sardinia. La Ciccia is packed every night so you probably cannot walk in and get a table. It's best to reserve in advance. I have sat at the small bar and that was quite nice as it provides the interesting opportunity to watch the chefs through the beaded curtain. I have enjoyed all that I have ever eaten at La Ciccia. They have a nice mix of appetizer, pasta, and main courses that blend seafood and meat. Both the squid and octopus appetizers are quite good and are definitely big enough to share with another or a third person. The wine list is very impressive and all of the servers are knowledgeable with the wines. As to the food, I've also enjoyed the pastas and they do a great job with various meats such as lamb and pork. Everyone who works there is very friendly -- the owners (a married couple) are absolutely charming. La Signora greets the guests (often with kisses on each cheek) and her husband is the chef who makes appearances on the floor to check that everyone is happy. . .everyone is! One point to keep in mind: the corkage fee is a whopping $35 -- so don't bring your own.

If you're in San Francisco and want authentic Italian food, make the trip to La Ciccia. (Make a reservation, to be safe). This is head &amp; shoulders above anything supposedly Italian that you will eat in Little Italy. La Ciccia's owners emigrated to SF from Italy. First discovered this gem in 2007 and went back again in October 2012. Both times, a memorable experience. Great service, great food, great atmosphere.

We went to La Ciccia on our vacation to San Francisco in September. I had the Spaghetti with Spicy Oil and Bottarga which was amazing and my partner had the Lamb with cooked grape must which was incredible. The staff was very friendly and incredibly welcoming. We spoke to a another couple sitting at a table next to us and they said that they eat at the restaurant two nights a week. I would too if I lived in San Francisco.My last name is Ciccia (which is not why I picked the restaurant), but I couldn't help but ask Lorella one of the owners, for a La Ciccia - t-shirt, which I now wear proudly. I will definitely return on my next trip.

First time at La Ciccia with two other friends last night. We were curious about this place and were looking forward to this outing as it had been a delayed graduation celebration/gift since May (due to a prolonged illness of one of our party, who also is sensitive to spicy, salty food and was our host). We decided to follow our server's suggestion based on our likes, and what was on the menu that day, we had the following:Organic Mix Greens Salad with ShrimpOven Roasted Monterrey Calamari drizzled with basil OilFresh Spaghetti with spicy Oil and BottargaOven roasted Sardinian Sea BassRoasted Prawns with Garlic and OnionsThe food was amazing! Not at all what one thinks of a 'typical Italian' restaurant. All our dishes were prepared perfectly, and while the portions are not large, they are very flavorful and satisfying. the seafood had a clean taste and not fishy. We are always on the lookout for too much salt or heavy overpowering sauces and we did not experience that here!We had a bottle of Proseco, which was very reasonable and much cheaper than ordering it by the glass.We shared a dessert: Ricotta and Saffron Cake served with honey and Almonds, which was just the right tone as it was not overly sweet nor heavy.Two of us ordered the house coffee (not like regular coffee, but an espresso with hot water), and it was delicious, flavorful not bitter. I was not affected by the caffeine as I am in other places.I am planning my next outing to La Ciccia and cannot wait to see what is fresh on the menu. A winner for those who adore seafood!Finally, the prices are not cheap (but also not overly expensive for SF prices, we averaged ~$68/person including taxes and tips), and the portions are not large, but the quality is excellent and you do not need to fill up on this kind of food as it is very satisfying.The parking is street parking and very tight, so plan accordingly, as you will be competing with the residents for a slot to park. The J Church runs right in front if you want to take MUNI.

I cannot rave about the food as others on this and other websites have done. I found the baby octopus in a spicy tomato sauce and the squid were nothing special, as a matter of fact, a bit on the bland size, though the tomato sauce was hot. Our waiter knew his wines and he suggested an excellent white and red wine. My sea trout, though sweet and tasty, was a little on the raw side placed atop a bed of overcooked spicey cabbage and wilted broccoli flowers, with a dollop of chopped olives on top of fish. I have not had Sardinian food before and it might be that it is always a little bit hot and spicy? The waiter-recommended homemade ice creams and saffon ricotta cake were very nice. I must mention that if you like cream with your coffee, there is no such thing as cream, just low-fat milk. Very disappointing for someone who likes coffee tasting like a dessert to be minus the cream. BUT it was excellent hand-pressed coffee.I think for the price of my dining experience, which was $70, I would not return. It is probably considered a neighborhood gem though, right at the end of the J Church streetcar line, which makes it a nice getaway from the civic center for a quiet dinner before going to the theatre??By the way, pictures of food are not allowed nor is the use of cell phones, of which I am in full agreement.

Yum!Couldn't get a last minute reservation for 2 at 6pm on a Tuesday so we arrived and luckily they had two perfect seats at the bar. Highly attentive service at the bar. Felt like I was at a table.In addition to their main menu, they have a salad, appetizer, pizza, and pasta special of the day.I wanted to try the octopus stew but my friend is allergic to squid, cuttlefish, and octopus so that was out. (Can't eat an entire app by yourself if you aim to get dessert!)Had the salad of the day which was a poached shrimp and endive salad. Dressing was amazing...had sort of an anchovie flavor. I mopped up the dressing with some bread.Since it was my first time I had to try the fresh spaghetti with spicy oil and bottarga (some type of shaved yellow roe)..... um sooo good. Decent perfect portion. It was enough to be the main given how rich it was.Friend had the pasta of the day which was a fettuccine in a tomato based veal and proscuitto sauce... it was incredible.Trio of gelato for dessert- fig&amp;goat cheese (refreshing), something &amp; raisen (a bit sweet), and vanilla bean (perfect).Wine and coffee were excellent as well.Will be coming back to try a non-pasta main! Can't wait. (Will make reservations ahead of time though!)

For our first visit to this great restaurant, where the owners make everyone feel like old customers, we enjoyed a few of their excellent dishes. The baked calamari is tender and very tasty. The baby octopus may seem odd if you're &quot;food squeamish&quot; but it's certainly worth trying. To some, octopus may seem like an exotic dish, but seafood aficionados know how good it can be and La Ciccia makes it good! The squid ink pasta is another dish that's a must try.Try any of the other dishes that strike your fancy and you won't be disappointed, I'm sure.We had a very nice Sardinian wine, Inu, as recommended by our waiter. Good choice!Leave some room for the gelato. You'll definitely want to try it!Reservations are a must. We went on a Sunday night and I didn't see an empty seat in the house. Reserve early. We reserved three weeks ahead of time.

La Ciccia was one of the highlights of my San Francisco trip. This is an excellent Sardinian restaurant with great service and amazingly delicious food. I would highly recommend pretty much all the pastas. It's probably not the best choice if you do not like pasta with seafood, but for pasta and seafood lovers this place is heaven. It's small, cozy, and as far as I can tell always full! Service is great with very attentive and friendly waiters. The whole atmosphere is more cozy than uptight, but you can tell they take food very seriously. If it's an option, try the goat cheese and fig gelato - it's amazing! They also have an impressive wine selection.You can reach La Ciccia very easily if you take the J Muni Train. It'll basically drop you off in front of the restaurant.Highly recommended!

As a thankyou to our great friends we decided to eat at La Ciccia, and with difficulty obtained a booking. The initial reaction on entering is how packed the tables are, and how many in in such a confined space. The small bar on the right hand side, with occupied seats again restricts movement, and the decor is fairly plain.The service is exemplary but that is all that could be said about our visit. It was obvious from the vocals of various waiters that Yellow Tail Mackerel type fish was the one to push, and it was quite reasonable, the oysters in a soup were great but so large as could be taken for mussels,the prawns a bit over charred and the seasoning quite strange,whilst the salad with a beautiful drizzle seemed to be only lettuce leaves.The attitude appeared one of hurry with the waiters trying to push the diners to spend more. The wine was rather expensive and taste did not compare with a similar type purchased locally for a quarter of the price.We were very disappointed with our visit to La Ciccia as it was a thankyou and goodbye to our friends and San Francisco.

This quiet little place has grown in stature since opening seven years ago, but the food and wine have been excellent from day one. Run by a friendly husband and wife team, the food is very traditional Sardinian...wonderful fish, pasta, and vegetables, much like Italian but with wonderfully different flavors and flourishes. Definitely try some of the Sardinian wines...we let Lorella (manager and wife of the chef) make suggestions and have loved every bottle. La Ciccia is a not to be missed treat...one of my top five in SF!

We were seated no problem, which was lucky because La Ciccia is definitely off the beaten track. The room is tiny and tight and the service is a little frantic. BUT, so worth it! The flavors are huge and everything was perfectly executed. Great Squid Ink!

This food is interesting - Sardinian cuisine, which is reminiscent of Italian but with slightly stronger flavors, The pasta was well cooked al dente with light but flavorful sauces. The fish dishes are interesting, including the sardine appetizer. The price is a little more than I usually spend on Italian. Probably best for couples or small groups since it's a small restaurant.

We've heard a lot about La Ciccia and wonderful it was, but it's hard to get a table unless you plan in advance, and we tend to decide to eat out the night of, so we've never been. However, after visiting Sardinia last year, we just had to La Ciccia since the couple that owns it are from Sardinia. Well, it did not disappoint! We've eaten at a lot of Italian restaurants and this was extremely authentic. They have some very interesting dishes that aren't for the faint of heart - Fregula with Sea Urchin Tomato and Cured Tuna Heart - but even that was good. Everything was fantastic, but you must try the Octopus stew in a spicy tomato sauce (but leave some sauce to dip your bread it - delicious!). It's a tiny place, but it's so worth being cramped!

After tasting the special burrata cheese appetizer with baby arugula and cherry tomatoes, I knew that we were going to be in for a treat at this intimate family Sardenian restaurant. The often mentioned octopus stew did not disappoint, either. What a rich, flavorful broth. To me, it was more like a soup than a stew. The octopus was wonderfully tender and the portions, very generous. It went perfectly with the red wine the server had selected for me.The pastas at La Ciccia are homemade and the fregula with sea urchin tomato and cured tuna heart certainly ranks as one of the best pastas I have ever had. Our kids shared a pizza margherita, made in a very traditional manner. There is definitely a respect for old values and carefully prepared homestyle recipes at La Ciccia.The trio of gelati that night was dark chocolate with hazelnuts, goat cheese with raisins...and I can't remember the third, since the goat cheese with raisins was such a knockout! The changing menu, gracious owner and &quot;off the radar&quot; feel of La Ciccia make it very special.

Our friends told us that La Ciccia would be unlike anything we'd ever had, and they were right. The service and atmosphere were wonderful -- warm, friendly, accommodating. We put ourselves in the hands of our waiter, and that was not a mistake. We ordered as we went along, starting with four different appetizers, then two pastas, and finally just one entree to split four ways. The amount of food was perfect, and no one seemed to mind that we ordered rather unconventionally.Among the appetizers, the roasted calamari was delicious, as was the burrata and the arugula salad. We had one pasta with sea urchin, and another that was a special which had a goat ragu. Both were delicious.The main course was lamb and it was perfectly prepared.We trusted our waiter with the wine selections, and both were very good matches with the food.La Ciccia was a wonderful experience - a great way to spend time with friends during our visit to SF, doing what we all love best -- eating great food and drinking wine!

When I asked my son who has lived in Italy where he might want to go for his birthday, La Ciccia came up immediately. I loved that because I had been reading about top rated restaurants recently and La Ciccia was on my list as well. This is a small neighborhood restaurant with a big star hanging over it. The Italian wine list is huge and we were led by our waitress to the perfect wine to fit all of our variant taste buds. Throughout the meal my son and I would laugh about the memory of the multi course Sardinian meal we had with our Italian family in Italy years ago and be amazed about how good La Ciccia was in recreating and upping the experience of it all. The service is impeccable. It is very small so you need to make reservations in advance. And...let them recommend what to eat based on your preferences.

On our last night in San Francisco we couldn't have dined at a better spot! Loved it all--the darling owner who makes a point of coming to the table to check on you, the knowledgeable server, the warm ambiance and best of all, the amazing food. Our party of 4 decided to share all dishes and started with the Burrata and asparagus appetizer special--simply scrumptious. For the second course we settled upon the fregola with creamy pink-tinged ricotta sauce and the semolina gnochetti with pork meats. The fregola was cooked to perfection with a consistency similar to a perfectly cooked al dente small pasta--the sauce was a creamy delight. The gnochetti sauce was spicy but not overly so. For the main course we went with the lamb tenderloin--it was perfection--incredibly tender, melt-in-the-mouth and served with a saute of spinach sweetened with balsamic vinegar. We declined dessert as one of our party was celebrating her birthday and we had dessert waiting at home. Our server brought our check along with a little roasted almond semifreddo cake with a candle in it! Perfect touch and enough for all of us to have a bite and enjoy! Thank you La Ciccia. We can't wait to return on our next visit to San Francisco. If you're lucky enough to live nearby, be sure to try this place. BTW, the extensive wine list is nothing short of incredible

This restaurant is phenomenal! Sardinian food is nothing like typical Italian food. We had the baked Calamari - it was the filet mignon of the sea prepared to perfection. Next we we had the Fregula with Fresh Ricotta and Cured Tuna Heart. This cannot be described - only experienced. The smell is rather pungent, but the taste is smooth and delicate. The waitstaff is intimately informed about the dishes and will describe everything in detail as well as compare/contrast dishes so you can choose something exactly right for you. The wines were wonderful as well. This is perfect to impress a date or your out of town guests.

My family stumbled upon this quaint restaurant after arriving at our rental property in the neighborhood (while on vacation) . We were able to get a table as it was fairly early, though by the time we left every table was full and lively. We had a delightful time- everyone working there spent time at our table, helped us with suggestions and explanations from the menu and specials. Even the cook came out to be sure we were enjoying our meal, and we were! From the pork to the pasta, calamari and octopus, it was all delicious! (The reason there was no butter, we were told, is that butter is not used in Sardinia... only olive oils... and she brought us out a tasty bowl for bread dipping.)

The Gnochetti with pork ragu and the pizza were decent. The octopus stew was horrible, the fishiest thing we've ever had. The wild shrimp dish was very pedestrian, and the braised vegetable was way overcooked. The service was kind of slow and not very friendly. We asked for more water 4 times before we got someone to refill our glasses. There are lots of better Italian restaurants in the neighborhood. Would not return.

Superb neighborhood restaurant

My wife and I eat twice in December, once with friends and once with family. We've concluded that it may be one of the best Italian neighborhood restaurants in the city. It's in a quiet residential neighborhood off Mission and is across the street from the stop for the J Line light rail, which allows one to get from downtown without a car..The restaurant is small, I'd estimate 12 to 15 tables plus a small number of seats at the bar and feels cozy but with little other ambiance.The service on the first visit was excellent, on the second visit it was merely very good. The menu is small, the wine list large with exclusively Italian wines and a preponderance from Sardinia. Its a little on the expensive side but the quality was high (between the two visits we had 5 or 6 bottles so we had a reasonable sample size). On one visit we took one of our own bottles but bought additional bottles and were not charged a corkage fee.The two meat dishes they had on the menu were excellent but the star of this restaurant is the pasta and fish. The linguine with shaved tuna heart was outstanding as was the noodles with squid ink, spaghetti with spicy oil and Bottarga and fresh sauteed sardines. Begin the meal with the Sardanian flat bread while you're deciding what to order. The cabbage served with the meat secondo was different on each visit but uniformly excellent.Very authentic food and while its not cheap it is definitely worth it. For anyone who has been to Rome it reminds me of a smaller version of TramTram in the San Leandro area.

Both the baby octopus stew and the seafood linguini were incredibly salty -- even the second plate of linguini they gave me, after the excellent wait staff enquired as to how I liked it. Service, atmosphere and wine list were great.

This is a Sardinian style Italian cuisine that is wholesome and hasgenerous portions. The y use very little salt or garlic.The wine list is very good. About three quarters are red wines, with about 30% of these being Sardinian. Recommendation: order a bottle of wine from the wine list; don't do wines by the glass. Could not find a white that I know, so we went with our fail-safe Barbera.Illica, a food server, read off the specials with everything having prosciutto and pecorino cheese; we were salivating.The lentil soup is super; the sardine appetizer was delish. They had pasta specials, but we went with the whole branzino fish (which they expertly filleted).The Sardinian cheese and honey dessert was very nice.The hospitality and service are excellent and well-coordinated.p.s. ciccia means belly fat

Very Friendly. Simple but great Sardinian Food.

I've been to San Francisco a lot and of all the places I have tried, this one is one of my favorites. The food was fresh (especially the pasta, fish and the octopus with this red gravy sauce), the service was wonderful and the atmosphere was as if you were in a European restaurant. Very small but charming. The tables are close together so it can get a bit noisy but it wasn't a concern. All in all a must try!

Yummy Sardinian food &amp; great, fairly-priced wine list. Cosy/ homey atmosphere.
