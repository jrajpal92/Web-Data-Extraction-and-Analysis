Relaxed Pleasant Place

If you are in the mood for Mediterranean food (Turkish in this case) this is a good casual place. We had salad, falafel, dolma, something called Borek (my favorite, it was like a spring roll but it was phyllo stuffed with Feta served hot - delicious).My only disappointment was no Turkish coffee. What????But it was a fun pleasant place.

Great brunch spot.. And looks like a fun evening bar/food scene! Had Salmon bagel omelette and they have bottomless mimosas for weekend brunch! Less crowded than &quot;Toast&quot;, a nearby breakfast cafe.. This place feels like the perfect &quot;special place&quot; to bring someone you want to impress or celebrate with.

Had brunch at Dunya's, was a pretty nice little place. Food was good without being amazing, although I thought the serving size was a little small for an Omlette, which I had. With bottomless Mimosas you could easily have a long lunch here and walk out pretty tipsy. Not sure if I'd go again but otherwise good quality food.

One of the best date spots in the city.

Fantastic food, great wine, very chill ambiance, and plenty of healthy food options if you feel like eating here every night. This place is a nob hill staple and you can't go wrong. Try the lamb burger or any of the kebabs, the meat is top notch, and the mezze platter is amazing too.

We went to this restaurant wanting something along the lines of a gyro. When we sat down and saw the menu seemed more upscale than we anticipated, we almost left. Very glad we didn't. We had the Kofte Kebab and Angus Burger. Both were delicious and savory, leaving us wanting more! A small condiment bowl of tzatziki sauce was $3 which we thought was a little expensive but otherwise definitely worth the value!

A bearded man with a dog recommended this place to us as we were dithering outside looking at the menu. We'd strayed far away from our hotel in search of a place away from the tourists and a little bit quieter than the main eateries in Union Square. Normally I would not have taken a recommendation from a random man but we ventured inside anyway. Were WE glad we did?Some of the best food I have ever had in my life I experienced here. I had chicken skewers which were large pieces of chicken and bell peppers but what the menu didn't mention that it would be served with rice (hurray!) and a thin piece of bread underneath (double hurray!). It far exceeded any expectation I had. The drinks were served in jar type things which I thought was quite cool. We were also seated quite closely in between two groups of diners, one of which was quite rowdy but they soon went off in search of a drinking establishment and the atmosphere was quite nice and chilled after that. We got a surprise when the bill arrived but not for the bill being too high, we felt that it was much lower than we expected - it was a shock to find a reasonably high quality dining experience in the very pricey SF area.I wish I lived closer to this restaurant so I could try the other items on the menu. I would definitely pay a return visit if it weren't 8000km away. I might also take on more food recommendations with strangers outside restaurants from now on!

This restaurant is a small, local gem. We went there at an odd time (around 4:30pm) what was supposed to initially be a drink and some apps but the food was so good, we kept on ordering. Our group ordered 2 Mezze Plates (delicious), Calamari, Adana Kabab and the Falafel plate. Everything was very tasty and flavorful. If you are a falafel purist, you may ask for the sauce on the side (I'm not sure what that sauce was - but it was not traditional Tahini). Overall, a lovely place to go for a casual meal of great food.

Our daughter lives in the neighborhood. So we visit this part of SF quite a bit. This week, we happened in to Dunya for a late dinner. WOW!! Now this is not your trendy SF spot that everyone is talking about. No, it is just great food and a very fair price, a good vibe, nice servers, friendly people. We loved it and will highly recommend it to everyone we know.We shared the Mezze Platter (one of the best we have ever had) and a few of the salads. Everything was fresh and delicious. We sat at the bar. Our server was great and the wine choices are good and fairly priced.In a city of a lot of over priced hype....this is a really refreshing find. Give it a try.Plus....there is something for everyone. Omnivores will love it and there are plenty of vegan choices.

I didn't think their food was that great. Perhaps it was just a fluke that day, since all the other reviews think the food is great. My sister's lamb in her lamb wrap was chewy. The crispy falafels were too crispy (maybe thats howthey are supposed to be) but they also lacked flavor. My chicken kabob was okay, I've had better. Vegetables were delicious, not sure what the seasoning was but it was really good.

We were walking in the neighborhood looking for a nice lunch option and happened upon Dunya. They had an open table on the sidewalk so we grabbed it, squished the 4 of us into the space and had lunch.The menu is primarily mediterranean in style. I had their kebab which was a combination of beef and lamb. it was excellent. Nice flavors, and a nice portion size, not to big or small. We also shared a hummus starter which was also very tasty, and came with plenty of flat bread for dipping amongst us.there isn't much room on the sidewalk, but it was sufficient.The wait staff did a great job, of staying in tune to our needs, keeping the water glasses filled, getting the bill, etc.... They tag teamed us between two different folk...and they kept it all straight and working. I would label the service as excellent. Especially how busy they were and the level of staffing I saw. Nice job.The food was very good...i'd go back for the food alone.My only negative was some of the local personalities we met, since we were sitting on the sidewalk table. One lovely gentleman kept threatening to rip my shirt off my back, cause he wanted it. This was after he gave up begging for funding!! Hey, your gonna get this in the city. it was bearable and we enjoyed the lovely weather and being able to sit outdoors.No regrets.......enjoy!!!

I actually jumped off the cable car looking for an ATM. I saw this quaint little bistro that served Mediterranean food and I ducked in. The food was amazing! I sat there with a glass of wine while reading and people watching. Next time I'm in San Francisco I am going back. I liked that it wasn't near all the touristy stuff, therefore you get a great meal at a reasonable price!

Lucky to get a table on a Monday evening after failing the night before. Great service, and the quality of the food was just magnificent. The four of us chose the Adana kebab, the prawn shish kebab, the lamb burger and the Angus beef burger. The burgers were made to order and to everyone's satisfaction, and in sensible portions for Europeans like us. Creative presentation of the dishes - not just on a simple plate.

A very good Mediterranean restaurant in the Nob Hill area that offers a variety of kebabs, salads, and even burgers. The appetizers were awesome as well!Like most restaurants in San Francisco, Dunya is small and gets pretty busy later in the evening. Definitely call for reservation before heading out.Overall the food is very good, but the prices are a little on the high side.

We love all kinds of Mediterranean food, and were very pleased to find a Turkish restaurant while in San Francisco. The establishment is very pleasantly decorated, clean and appealing. The menu was varied and it was hard to decide what to order. The Mezze platter was a great option since it provides samples of many tasty items that they have on their menu (which you can view online), and which proved to be extremely filling. We also ordered the Stuffed Felafel Salad (which was very good), and the Musakka (which was good but it was not properly heated -- it came to the table cold). We asked that they please re-heat the Musakka, and they ended up bringing us a fresh order, which was also cold! Our waiter recommended a nice red wine, which we enjoyed. Our waiter then left for the night without asking us if we needed anything else. When another lady brought us our check, we said, &quot;but what about dessert?&quot; She told us that the kitchen was already closed, but made an exception for us and brought us out the MOST DELICIOUS and fresh Baklava I have ever had! I would strongly recommend this restaurant. Although the service needs a tune-up, I loved this place!

I sought out Dunya on a friend's recommendation. Their web site mentioned a happy hour, so I went at about 5:00 pm before a concert. Nope, no happy hour, they said. Place was almost empty, not quite. Good friendly service, nice small restaurant. I had lamb kebab and an Italian beer, very good, nice portions. Probably would be a more lively and better experience later on, with more people. But why advertise a happy hour on your web site and then not have one, or at least honor the offer.

This little place is not near the tourist areas but rather on Polk Street. Everyone inside was local and they were loving it. We chatted with a few and found they come often and never tire of the choices. It's Mediterranean but light and a bit fusion--with what I'm not sure but it was just wonderful. Portions were generous but the food light so we didn't leave hungry but we didn't leave stuffed either. Excellent wine menu, too. Not a lot of tables so get there early or late or make a reservation. Ambience perfect, if a little loud when it's full.

If Turkish food is what you want around here, this is the place to be.Adana kebap was perfect, correct heat on the grill is key to keep it moist on the inside, this was as good as I have had it in US or Canada. The Bayti was fantastic, the tomato sauce was as good as I has had outside of Turkey. Bite of meat with the sauce and yogurt is heaven.

My husband and I are in SFO over the long labor day weekend. We were walking around Polk St, where there are more restaurants and bars than there are days in the year. We came across this quaint restaurant quite by chance. We absolutely loved the appetizer platter which had an assortment of humus, Tzatiki, eggplant dip, falafel, veggies and pita. We shared it for dinner.

We were in the neighborhood and hungry, so we stopped in for some Mediterranean food. We were blown away. The decor is unusual and fun, the service was outstanding, and the food was the best I've ever had, especially the pita &quot;chips&quot; for the tzatziki. They were warm and soft and fabulous. I had the Adana Kabab that came with perfectly spiced rice, vegetables and broiled red pepper. I will definitely make this a must see when we come back to the city.

We like the surrounding of the place. The food is fine although it is more Greek than American food. The vegetables were a bit cold that was not necessary. The meat is very fine. What we didn't like is the 20% they charge you for tip on your bill, they say it is there normal fee but is wasn't on the price list. If you want to charge that then say you do.

After searching for some good food around the area, we stumbled upon Dunya. We were welcomed inside and got a nice table. We were early, so we basically had the place to ourselves until an hour later when it started filling up fast.We started off with the appetizer sampler, which was delicious. It was also the perfect size for two people to share, just as the waiter had advised us. Along with a good bottle of Malbec wine, we split the special, a grilled fish entree with a Greek salad. The Greek salad was more of a garnish instead of a side salad, which was a bit disappointing. However, the fish was fantastic.The interior decorations were beautiful and the service was excellent, making this a perfect place to relax after a long day exploring the city.

I've been to Dunya several times now, the first time great food, great service. The second time good food, good service. This last time a few days ago, okay food, poor service. What a shame, wanted this to be my go to place when in that neighborhood. I got the lamb kebobs the first time, and they were tender, cooked medium, almost melting in the mouth. This time they were overcooked, and the meat was tough. First time we went, service over the top, quite phenomenal, this time don't know if the waiters were stressed, because it was a busy weekend night, but the service was only OK. May give it one more try, because I love Turkish Mediterranean food, when it is prepared right!

We had some time to kill and looked around for a place for lunch. We decided to try &quot;Dunya&quot;.The restaurant is very nicely decorated with a southern European atmosphere. The music is &quot;easy listening&quot;, not too loud and relaxing.We ordered Kofte and a smoked salmon panini.The food was great! Just the right size for lunch, very tasty and &quot;different&quot;. There is no salt and pepper on the table - you don't need it. It was just perfectly spiced and the salad dressing was yummy too.The service was excellent, we enjoyed the whole experience.

This was a great choice for a business group of 7 people. We were able to get a reservation same day even though they don't have a lot of space. The wait staff was constantly filling water glasses and always nearby to bring pita bread or another serving of hummus.Would recommend the mezze platter to try most of the appetizers. I enjoyed the Beyti and would also recommend the Mixed Grill if you're really hungry.Great atmosphere and would absolutely go again.

This is a popular, crowded, neigborhood place with reasonable prices.

My wife, her friend, and I had &quot;prawns.&quot; These were actually shrimp and fairly small ones at that, and they were overcooked. If you're going to serve prawns in San Francisco, they'd better damned well be prawns.

I went to Dunya after wandering around trying to find a restaurant that struck my fancy. I ultimately chose it for the warm and inviting light pouring out of the front windows - the atmosphere of the place was very important to me on that particular night. It didn't disappoint - warm red and golden light and very nice music, a good sized place with an open kitchen and large wrap around bar was just the thing.Unfortunately, I wasn't in the mood for Turkish food. My bad, not theirs. I ended up having some nice wine and the cheese plate, which was good but not great. The cheeses were fine but the plate itself could have/should have been better. Crisp pita bread a few sliced strawberries do not a nice cheese plate make.If you like Turkish food (like Greek) this place seems like a great bet.

We were going to go somewhere else recommended by Trip Advisor within walking distance of our hotel, but the Super Bowl was on and people were 10 deep, and we thought service may falter. So a little further on, we found this, and a quick TA check showed that it was also well rated. We were met by the friendly waiter and given a table. There were a few people there, and after the game a few more people came in. However, we chose some house specialities (egg plant and chicken dish, with a calamari appetiser cooked in a delicious tomatoey sauce), and were not disappointed. It was all quite tasty washed down with a reasonably priced Argentinian Malbec.

Local fresh chicken and lamb, everything prepared in reasonably healthful manner with local veggies. Generous portions and appetizers are under $10 and mains usually about $15ish. Fun exciting atmosphere, friendly helpful staff. Good wine list. I see a lot of dinners here in my future.
