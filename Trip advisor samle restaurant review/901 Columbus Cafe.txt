We found this bar while walking from Union Square to Fishermans Wharf.Sign outside said $2.50 Draft Beers - Wow,how cheap is that for a large beer in SF! A nice little bar/cafe which does good priced food at cheap prices,full of locals which is always a good sign.Great value bar near the Wharf.

Where else can you get a draught beer for $2.50 at happy hour?

This is a little gem! They do beer at Happy hour (weekdays from 5.00pm) at just $2.50 a glass - and it is a decent sized glass at that. Simple food available to at sensible prices.I can't praise this place enough. It restored my faith in San Francisco that there are places that are affordable!

Just walked up to Lombard St and back so needed a beer. This place is right on the corner and hits the spot. Seemed popular with locals which is a good sign.

Came across this little gem on our first night. Hovered outside and a local recommended it. Not far to walk from Fishermans Wharf or you can hop on a cable car. $2.50 for draft in happy &quot;hour&quot; - which is basically all evening. Great selection of hot sandwiches, paninis etc - summarised as tasty doorstops! Unusual combinations available - worth trying something different. Went back again on our last night just for the beer. Free wifi.

Great place, good bear and a comedy club next door

If you're looking for a brew, a quick bite and some people watching this is the place. There's not a lot of tourists here so you really get the local flavor plus you get to oogle at the line snaking past the window to Cobbs comedy club. At happy hour you get two pints for 5 $ and it's the good stuff, IPA:s and the lot. Great place, friendly staff and good service.

The Panini's are good. It took a long time to get them though. Everything on the menu looked good, we saw people order waffles, they looked so amazing, sweet and savory options. Cool atmosphere and area

This is a great little cafe, accessible on the Powell-Mason St cable car route.Outside tables are in a nice sunny position and great for people watching. Cable car stop right outside but be sure to finish your take-away coffee before embarking otherwise you'll have to choose between staying put or throwing a great coffee in the bin in favour of a coveted seat (no food/drink allowed on the cable car)!Great service - fast and friendly :) Food was tasty and fresh...panini's were YUMMY &amp; the most authentic we've tasted in North America. Coffee (latte) satisfied these critical Aussies. I highly recommend the Sunset Boulevard (salad of spinach, watermelon, cucumber, feta, raspberry sauce) - a nice change from the fatty fast food common to tourist areas AND the sauce wasn't sickly sweet, nor did it drown my salad (score!).The inside capacity is bigger than it looks from the outside; comfy atmosphere; wifi and restroom.Well worth the 15-20 minute walk from the wharf to escape the rat race.

We went there a group of 5 people and all uf us were so angry at the end. The stuff was so unfriendly at us. Very snippy and bigheaded. The prices are fair, but the staff ruined everything, especially the woman who worked there.

Its hard to walk by a $2 draft beer sign. We did not pass this one up...walking back to fishermans wharf from chinatown and happened by columbus cafe today. We had the chocolate cake dessert and a beer and wine. It all hit the mark. Did not eat here but the place has decent panini and wrap menu on the wall. Great atmosphere. Worth a try if you are near.

Perfect spot to stop in for breakfast, lunch, dinner or afternoon beers! Came by for lunch and was pleasantly surprised will all the good food options, lots of fresh salads and sandwiches! Plus $2 beers. There are a few outdoor tables perfect for people watching.

Do you need another reason besides $2 draft beers? I didn&#39;t think so.

We arrived here by advice of an extremely helpful tour guide who told us to walk up Hyde street from Fisherman's Wharf so we could see Lombard street from the top, then walk down it until we hit Columbus and we should reward ourselves with $2 drafts after. Best plan ever! San Francisco street hill hikes are quite the trek for people that live in completely flat cities (Miami!) and we took on the challenge mostly for the thought of beer as a prize.901 Columbus Cafe welcomed us with open arms, some great IPA drafts and a cozy ambiance. We spent probably close to 5 hours there, not wanting to leave (or stop drinking)... It's definitely a fun chill hangout, especially after some physical activity (namely 16 mile bike rides and Hyde street hiking).If you're not a fan of the drafts they have (only 3 when I went), their bottled selection is also super cheap. We didn't eat but tables around us seemed to enjoy their plates.Really though, $2 beers!

Nice place for rest, food and draft beer

We were really surprised. The draft beer for 2 dollars was really good. I would say like self brewed... Nice place to hang out after exploring San Francisco.... Especially since everyone is thirsty after climbing coit tower :)The food looks also great, but we didn't eat here, just looked at it. Prices are also really great for San Francisco!

Unassuming and cozy a few steps away from Lombard street

We were looking for something to eat before climbing Lombard street so we decided to try the 901 Columbus Cafe.There's a great choice of salads and sandwiches. Prices are very reasonable and the food is fresh and tasty.The place is very cozy and free wifi is offered. You can also enjoy cold and hot beverages (smoothies, coffees, sodas, beers, etc.).Perfect for a stop before/after hitting Lombard Street.

I really love the atmosphere in this place. It's comforting, warm, and quaint but still has the hip vibe of a typical coffee shop in the city. I'm also a huge fan of the free wifi and $2 drafts! Didn't have any food, but the nice young man next to me commented that his sandwich was excellent!I stopped in for a quick computer break during a long conference week. Glad I made the visit!

Bf and I went to the cafe during happy hour. Every day including weekends from 4-8pm it is buy one get one free on beers. Note! If you pay with credit card they charge a $15 min. Beers are $5 each. So in theory you will have to order 3 beers and drink six so be prepared. When you order a beer they give you a casino chip you can use to pay for your free beer. Chips must be used by 9pm. But if you are coming back another day you can use the chip then. Younger crowd. Mix of locals and tourists. Best seat is at the bar to watch the gong show unfold. A bit loud if you like a quieter atmosphere.

Made the mistake of running up Lombard Street....it felt easier than walking up it.Collapsed in a heap at the bottom and dragged myself to 901 Cafe. Ordered a Sandwich that puts any deli in England to shame and sat outside watching the world go by. The music was so hipsterish I felt like clicking my fingers and saying daddio all the time!

Stumbled upon this hidden gem while waiting to go to dinner after checking out Lombard Street. The happy hour wine lured us in and was pretty good and excellent value. The place had a nice atmosphere and comfortable seating, there was plenty of people there using the free wi-fi. Good place to people watch and a wide range of food esp some lovely home made tiramisu. Sort of cafe type place you'd like to have at home

Visited this cafe as we were staying at an apartment up Lombard Street.Cafe 901 offers a great choice of very reasonably priced sandwiches and other food and is ideal if you are looking for a quick mealor snack. It's prices, as highlighted by other reviewers, are excellent which no doubt helps its popularity.The only critsicm rests with that popularity. With very few tables, our visit saw 3 or 4 diners who had clearly finished making use of the free wifi but effectively blocking certain parts of the cafe with their laptops. Not a major issue but one that has prevented me giving it 5 stars. Nevertheless, i'd still visit again next time i'm in SF.

This place has an excellent cafe atmosphere, and incredible prices. We had $2 drafts that other bars have at $5. There are plenty of tables and games, books available. I wish I lived down the street of a place like this.
