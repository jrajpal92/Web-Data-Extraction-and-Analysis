So So,Nice place from a design point of view. For my personal taste I didn't eat a great steak as was my expectations. The main room was too noisy for me. Service is great! A bit expensive considering the quality of the meet. In any case I will be back for a second chance.

Best Steak Ever

Quite simply the best steak ever. We had three 3 oz Wagyu steaks: 2 from Japan (Miyagi and Gifu) and the US Imperial Wagyu between two of us with confit potatoes and wild mushrooms. It is cooked to perfection. But with a starter as well (I think the best choice for sharing is the Edamame, although we both had HonnHamachi as well) and indeed two deserts this is an expensive place. Worth it? Without doubt.

We went there with a party of four. From 1 of the 5 regular steaks David the waiter told us only at the order that they are sold out:-( not a good start, the sommelier only recommended wines with highest price tags and ended up serving a $ 155 red wine at 12 degrees Celsius, too cold for established European taste and too bad for the wine itself. The steaks were fine but not phenomenal, side dishes very strange and not authentic. As stomachs were full we ended with a small espresso which was too burned:-( overall we paid &gt;$ 500 for 4 persons and its not worth it at all! PS: serving techniques are a disaster: removing plates while others are still eating is an absolute No Go!

We booked a last minute New Year's Eve prix fixe dinner reservation, and you had to wonder why it was still open because for almost a thousand dollars, we had these tiny servings of food, which were not memorable - only the wine was. We got to taste a tiny morsel of Wagyu steak - it tasted like butter - if this is what you like of your steak, and a morsel was enough. Simply, just too rich to consume more. Not everyone like all that fat on their steaks. You will no doubt end up with a heart attack.The place's decor is average - not much to accommodate the expensive prices. I believe there are other steakhouses that would give you better value for your hard earned money.Not worth it afterall.

after eating at BENU (good) and MANRESA (excellent) on day 3 of the San Fran trip we felt we want to eat a steak and went to Alexanders. beet salad as an appy and some small bites were all very good and my tenderloin was perfect. my wifes prime rib was a little cold ..so they had to warm it up again ...but it was a hugh piece and very good meat. the have a lot of wagyu beef and also omaha prime (for me the best meat you can buy) ....the manager osh was very nice and also all the stuff.

We were a party of 6 on October 1. We had reserved for 20:00. As we were running late due to traffic, we called them at 19;45 to mention we would be a bit late and asked them if we could arrive at 20:30 instead of 20:00. We were strickly told that was not possible and 20:15 was the latest we could arrive. So we rushed and made it in time for 20:15 to realized the place was far from full......Service was good as the steaks but appetizers and sides were ridicusly small and extremely expensive (as the steaks...)I am a regular client of american steakhouses but Alexanders is really way pricier and not worth it. I do not recommendLuc

A serious steak offering !!

Located in the now fashionable South of Market ( SoMa) San Francisco area, this Brannan Street restaurant has a strikingly different approach to the norm when it comes to steak houses.The first difference, there is only steak on the main course menu !!Yes, &quot;you can have the swordfish appetizer as a main course&quot; but that's about it.You come here for a steak and that's what you're going to get and a pretty darn good one at that !!The restaurant has Japanese overtones evident in style and presentation in some first or second courses.This theme abounds on nearly an entire page of Wagyu from all ends of the globe that produces this style of meat but never, ever have I seen so many offerings from Japan itself !!But if this is too rich for your taste, and or pocket, you'll not be disappointed in their filet, conventional or bone in. They were cooked to perfection and of the highest quality.Cured foi gras and tomato tart starters were amazing but the uni toast, braised oxtail with marrow toasted brioche, was out of this world.Of the main course sides we ordered, the caramelized onions stood out so much so, that we had to re order !!!They have a very serious wine list and a Sommelier that thoroughly enjoys his job.This is a serious steak house with a difference. It sets a high bar and a high price with itTake the leap of faith with them, you will not be disappointed!!!

As a frequent traveler, I have experienced a lot of steakhouses around the world. Alexander's was easily my favorite in North America, but my most recent visit was a disappointment.First, let's clear the elephant from the room: the cotton candy tradition is no more. Is this a big culinary deal? No. Is it a big experiential deal? Yes, yes it is. The cotton candy was a fun twist on the end of a meal that could be a wonderful but a little pretentious. There is no smile at the end of dinner anymore. Just the giant bill.And what a giant bill it is. You can't do Alexander's right and get away on the cheap. I have no problem with high priced meals... as long as the food and the service was worth it.This time, it wasn't.It also seemed the cocktails were over priced, even by high-price restaurant standards.The staff was uneven at best. Some seemed to care quite a bit while others were clearly phoning it in.The meal was good, but not great. If this were my first Alexander's dinner, it would have been my last. That pains me to say. The kitchen had trouble getting steaks cook properly, which is really job #1 at a place like this. We heard excuses, but no one took ownership for the fact that we were paying top dollar for food from a kitchen that couldn't deliver what was ordered.I will give Alexander's another chance since my prior experiences were so wonderful, but I fear that the demise cotton candy is just the tip of iceberg when it comes to changes at the restaurant.

Where to begin? Everything was perfect from the whiskey selection at cocktails through to the cotton candy (yes, the best cotton candy you have ever had) that came with the check. All of our steaks were cooked perfectly for the cut.. I mean perfectly. My bone-in NY was a pleasure. The sides and appetizers we tried were all great, but special call outs are deserved for the corn gratin and the mac &amp; cheese. Bacon rolls with marrow butter were among the between course treats.Serivce was vey good. Atmosphere was very good.All in all, there wasn't anying to fault. If you like fantastic steaks and are willing to experiment with your sides, this is your steakhouse.

Alexander's blew me away on my first visit a year ago. Round two was just as good. From a very good bourbon and wine list (beer choices are weak and limited, esp draft) through excellent courses, this remains a great restaurant. Highlight of this visit? Toast with ox tail and uni. Wonderful!

Special occasion ruined by a really bad steak

We went there on a very special occasion , and thorouly enjoyed the long evening we spent there. The service was impeccable, and the waiters at least two at all times were very attentive to all questions and compliments. The appetisers, the salads, the display was out of this world, Wien list was extensive and expensive as was the menu. Don't come her if your worried about the cost. The unfortunate part for me was being uncomfortable about complaining in front of my guests that the steak they served me was almost inedible. Everyone had the Kobe of course, but I ten toward a good old fashioned rib eye best of the beef as I say. order a 16 oz rib eye rare and I expect it to be at least two inches thick. this thing was fatty, stringy, thin and over cooked. Embarrassingly bad . IF you go there, insist they bring the steak to your table before you let them cook it for you. I probably won;t be giving them a second chance, too many other places know better.

Came here for a father's day dinner and was seated 30 mins past our reservation time. As you know with children, it tends to be a little more difficult to keep them waiting. A manager (asian) did come up to us to let us know we should be seated shortly.After seated, the waiter did not acknowledge us until 15 mins later. No settings, no menu, no water etc.As a big foodie, I wanted to know the difference between all the wagyu meats offered. The waiter failed to explain anything except for his favorite choices. I asked more questions and he was frustrated and flustered so he brought out the packaged meats to show us. Still he did not answer any of our questions. I ended up ordering blindly &amp; was disappointed because of the taste and saltiness of the wagyu.Another issue with the waiter was he kept trying to upsell us. I know how much I can eat and same with the others in the party but he kept try to get us to over order.Aside from being dissatisfied with the food, the dessert was horrible. Lastly, when the check arrived, he automatically entered a 20% gratuity when I felt his service sucked. Is that customary for a party of 4??All in all, I will never return to this location... spent way too much for a bad experience.

Even though their steaks were pricey, they were some of the best steaks we've ever had. My 20 oz. bone-in rib eye chop ($70) was cooked perfectly at medium rare and it was very tender and flavorful. I'm glad Alexander's doesn't offer A1 steak sauce because that would be an insult to the steak. Only complaint I had was my side dish of spring vegetables. At $16, they brought out a small serving of assorted vegetables, which wasn't even enough to share with others. Other than that, service was excellent and their wine list was pretty extensive.

As always the steaks were great. The same unfortunately cannot be said for the service. My partner ordered an asparagus salad with her steak (actually a starter dish). What arrived was a small side salad which we sent back. There was barely an apology but they said the salad would be right out. When we had almost finished our meal we called the waiter over to cancel the salad. Again barely an apology. Then the bill arrived and there was the asparagus salad! We didn't even get offered a cup of coffee as compensation. The staff need to be trained to take ownership of a problem and sort it. Rather spoilt the meal and we will be going to other steakhouses in San Francisco in future.

OK, so if you have read some of my reviews, you already know that I like and appreciate many different kinds, styles of cuisine.That said, Alexander's is a steakhouse and is by far my favorite restaurant in SF. I know - steaks? - yes, because it is amazing.Not only do you get (and need) an explanation of the available steaks before you order, but there is always a twist on the banal. It is not your average steakhouse. It takes a meal to an entirely different level.True, it may be considered by some to be a bit over the top in terms of steak sold in 3 ounce increments, but honestly the Prime Rib (($50 when we were there) is to die for so you don't have to go for the most expensive cuts on the menu.The service is terrific and the wines both wide and deep in choice.This restaurant demands your attention at least once - and you will be hooked if you try it.A note, they do not have the cotton candy at the SF location any more (what a teaser, right?) but they do have it at the other locations (or so we were told).Also the appetizers and desserts are well worth a try (I dare you to choose just one!)Although Alexander's is wickedly expensive, and the clientele is obviously techy, it is nonetheless a wonderful venue for a special occasion or when showing out of town guests why no other city compares to SF in cuisine.Alexander's is my favorite Sf restaurant!Enjoy!

Took a group of customers here for dinner and really enjoyed it. The food and service were top notch. The prime rib seems to sell out since I think it is the lowest priced meat item, so one of our guests got the last one and the rest had to choose other meals. Thankfully, none of them ordered from the Wagu beef menu which was very expensive, over $100 each for a 3 oz portion. Everyone in our group enjoyed their meals as well as the appetizers of hamachi shots and edamame and sides of shichimi fries and mashed potatoes. This is definitely not for the businesses with frugal expense accounts, but for a customer event, it was very nice.

Will never enjoy a run of the mill steakhouse again after dining at Alexander's.

Let's get one thing out of the way - this is a seriously expensive place to eat. If everyone drinks don't be surprised at a bill over $200/head - and that gets a LOT higher if you're ordering the top cuts of Wagyu.That being said, this is also one of the best dining experiences you can have. From the Hamachi shots (I could have just had 10 of these for dinner and been happy), through the various mains to the best Wagyu I've ever had, finishing with artisan coffees that are unbeatable.Go here if you want a very special experience with professional but fun staff, and don't mind giving your credit card a workout.

Nice restaurant and the steaks were excellent.

It's just overpriced for even the very good food and attentive service.

While on a business trip, I was very excited to try this restaurant. With all the wonderful reviews it must be good right? Wrong. Very Wrong.Myself as well as my Boss had very high hopes as we entered this restaurant scene. The location was fair and the building was very well designed. We sat down for dinner and were treated kindly, but as if we had never eaten a piece of meat in our lives. I can say the same when we were choosing a wine for our dinner; once again the servers acted as if we were children. We looked past this and waited for our first course.I can go on for hours about our story, I will make it quick and easy:1. The salad was bitter and awful.2. The meat was fair in taste but did not meet the size that was stated on the menu.3. The glasses and cutlery were dirty and stunk.4. The steak knives did not cut!5. The portions were EXTREMELY small (not at all worth the money we paid).Overall, we were very unsatisfied with our meals and paid a hefty price for nothing more than a fun-sized dining experience.

This is a place you want to go for a special occasion as it's very expensive (even for SF standards). Service is impeccable and the place is nice and cozy. Appetiser options were good bit nothing I would have died for. Instead, meat was excellent, with amazing cut of great steaks that you can possibly get lost in the choices. As for me, I rather have a succulent t-bone or great steak vs micro portion of Wagyu coming at 300$ per couple of bites. Worthing? Yes but maybe once per year...

I am a big fan of Alexander's - my wife and I have been to the Cupertino restaurant countless times since they opened, and we've gone to The Sea in Palo Alto a bunch of times too. I've even checked out their pastry shop in Mountain View.So it goes without saying that I had high expectations for this Alexander's in SF. It was a company party, so I booked the Boardroom, which is a separate room upstairs overlooking the tables and the bar downstairs.The coordination with the restaurant for the event was excellent, the service during the dinner was superb, and most importantly everyone loved it. The hamachi shots of course were a hit, the oysters were great. The main dishes were top notch, and as my vegetarian employee said, her food was exceptional. Altogether an excellent night!Location wise, there is a parking lot literally a couple of buildings away. The lot attendant leaves at 6pm, but it's a well lit, safe place, so no worries. And what's more, the restaurant is right near the major freeways, so getting in and out was easy.So now I've tried all the Alexander's restaurants in the Bay Area. I understand that there is one in Pasadena? We'll have to go there too!In short, this place is highly recommendedPS: there is one major bummer. The restaurant no longer gives out the cotton candy at the end of the meal. This was a signature offering before the bill. I've had some of the best cotton candy - banana, passion fruit, chocolate... it was different every time. I'm hoping that we'll see a come back. And if not, I'll pay for the cotton candy for my dessert!

I eat at a nice steakhouse in every big city I go to. I have a very complex rating system for each. I'll leave out the finer details and keep the review at a reasonable length. This one earns a 5 STAR ... Here's why.The service and presentation at this restaurant was amazing. They were on spot with everything. Water choices, (free food, &quot;compliments of the chef&quot;), making sure we were okay, food timing and delivery, cleaning the table in-between courses, knowledge of the menus, seating us on time, food presentation, unique dish-ware, and a very friendly staff.The food was cooked perfect. The Australian Wagyu was amazing, I've had it before at other restaurants and this was very comparable to every other experience. Worth the price. The Wagyu steak also came with a variety of 12 salts that you could apply to it. They were great! (I applied a little bit of each salt to different slices.) Even though in reality it didn't need any salt. The steak was perfect as it was. The sides were big enough to split between two people. Same with the desert.There is to much to say, but overall... This place was in the Very Fine Dining category. It was very expensive, but I was okay with it. &quot;You get what you pay for&quot; at this place. I would definitely go here again.Thanks for the great food and service!

Recommended by our concierge. Impeccable reception welcome and service thoughout our visit. This is a top notch restaurant to cater for the more well heeled clientele.Wide choice of drinks, cocktails, wines on offer and the steak - the steak!! There is choice of the best cuts and meat in the world.I had a T-bone at $96 and my wife a filet at $70 and both were cooked and presented immaculately.Try the Macaroni Cheese and the Creamed Corn as sides, you will not be disappointed.This steakhouse competes favourably with the best in London (Goodmans, Goucho Grill) so if it's exclusivity and refinement you are after, this place is for you.Downsides? You are going to pay a minimum of $150 for two people but to really enjoy the experience (we didn't take a bottle of wine and just had mains and coffee) you are going to be lighter by $300 by the end.The cheapest available cut was Prime Rib 14oz or 20oz but this had 'sold out' by 8:30pm. This forced you to select another cut above $50 or $60. This did not include any sides.On balance, you get what you pay for and this steak house does do it very very well!

Our concierge got us last minute reservations at this outstanding, but very pricey steakhouse after we were unable to get into a different, highly recommended restaurant that only served prime rib. We had no idea that it was going to be so expensive. Living near New York City, we are accustomed to paying high prices for good food, however, these prices were above Peter Luger's and Smith and Wollensky. In a word, exorbitant. The service was impeccable, the food heavenly and the steaks were cooked to perfection. My one regret is that I had not fasted for a couple of days or even all day. The meal was rich and and very filling, I could not even come close to finishing it even though I ordered the smallest filet. My husband had the dry aged strip steak and he was in heaven. We ordered macaroni and cheese which was decadent and mushrooms which were delicious. We passed on the fresh cotton candy after dinner snack as we were stuffed! Much to our surprise the waiter told us our concierge arranged for a hot lava cake. We managed to find just enough room for it, as it too was outstanding. My advice to those of you who don't mind paying a lot of money for a great meal, get ot you credit card and save your appetites, this place will not disappoint.

The steaks at Alexander's are very good and prepared very well. Sides are a la carte. They have a good selection of different cuts as well as a selection of Wagyu beef. The quality and level of food and service are delivered here.

This phenomenal restaurant is &quot;Top 3&quot; best steak I've ever had... and I consider myself an experienced connoisseur. Start to elegant finish, this was a sublime experience. Wagyu definitely A5, aged perfectly, prepared with intense attention to detail, and incredible service. Memorable. $600 for the 2 of us.

We were celebrating milestone birthdays for two friends. So, we had a private room on the lower level. The starters were okay, the mains were excellent, the dessert was dreadful, and the drinks were great. Overall a good experience, but be prepared...it's pricey!

it was late on a Friday night and using a variety of restaurant apps, found this place, we actually found street parking - ind Downtown SF - it was 10:00 and the place was jumping - the food is awesome and incredibly expensive - but - once a while..... son Scott found a $35 filet as opposed to the $350 tomahawk whatever - they brought us amuse bouche to begin with and then another at the end of the meal. the best service ever. wait staff in suits no less and very professional.

This was my second visit to Alexander's - the first visit was this past February and Rob and I decided to visit again since it was fabulous the first time. When we made the reservation we requested the server we had last time, &quot;Mr. Peters&quot; -- a.k.a., Blake -- since he was so professional and fun. (This is a high-end restaurant and the servers wear gorgeous suits and ties and the staff refer to each other &quot;formally.&quot;)When we arrived, we learned that &quot;Mr. (Blake) Peters&quot; was the Maitre d. Upon our arrival he dashed over to apologize that he wouldn't be serving this evening and introduced us to Julio who turned out to be as competent and as much fun as Blake! We were off and running with complimentary glasses of Champagne and jovial chatter.We ordered perfectly-made martinis to start -- what goes better as prep for steak? Especially with 3 blue cheese olives ;-) To start, Rob &quot;indulged&quot; in the Uni toast and 3 Kumamoto oysters and clearly enjoyed them both. I selected the Mangalitsa pork terrine simply because it has bacon and English peas. When it was served it looked like foie gras! And, it was also delicious.The steaks and meats... there is a serious range of options across all price ranges: steaks, roasts and WAGYU. We both had filet mignon - one 8 ounce and one 10 ounce bone-in. Yes, perfectly cooked. For sides, we enjoyed the mac &amp; cheese and one &quot;healthy&quot; choice of sugar snap peas. Rob paired this with a lovely red burgundy from an incredible wine list ranging from glasses to an unusually large selection of half bottles and full bottles from everywhere.Throughout our meal we were lavished with attention from both Blake and Julio -- and the rest of their team. Service was attentive, engaging, professional and, yes, fun!And the evening ends for all with a childhood treat: a signature serving of bubble gum flavored cotton candy.Is it pricey? Yes. Is it worth it? That's for each to decide; for us, yes. And we will come again!

Best steakhouse experience ever

I see some disappointed people which is really different from my experience.I was there on a Sunday evening.Ambiance: very nice, dimmed lights, not too loud, I like the open kitchen, there was a bit of a draft from the AC, but nothing we bothered mentioning.Service: absolutely perfect. The staff was knowledgeable about the food and wine. Friendly and efficient without being a pain in the axx, like you see at many U.S. High end places.Food: I had the 14oz prime rib and it's definitely one of the best pieces of meat I have ever had. Tender, juicy, perfectly seasoned...yummy!Price: expensive! But considering what we got in terms of food, complementary candy-cone and experience, it was worth it! I wouldn't go there everyday, but once in a while is ok. I will definitely go again though!

Disappointing

We came with high expectations and were totally frustrated. Even though the service is great the food was very disappointing, my husband's prime rib was cold and when we sent it to the kitchen it only came back after everybody was done. My daughter's side of French fries only came after we ask for it again and it she was already done with her meat. The New York steak wasn't tender and the side portions are very small even though we were told they were big and to share.They were nice enough to offer us complimentary dessert because of all the problems , but it was still a bad experience. compliment goes to the amazing service and to the cotton candy. But still overpricedfor what they delivered.

The service is beyond compare and that is why I gave it a three rating. The menu is very different. We started with the Mangalitsa Pork Terrine, I would not recommend it. It was a raw bacon blended into a paste. My boyfriend had the bone in filet, no better than anywhere else. I had the Wagyu Lone Mountain Ranch U.S., I have had filet mignon for half the price that was more tender and had more flavor. The sides were very good, but we were there for the beef.

$700 for 4 people should leave you with &quot;WOW&quot; used in referring to more than just the bill. Nice but somewhat sterile atmosphere with average food seems to be the vibe here. Fancy sounding yet bland appetizers. The steak was cooked to the wrong temperature and possibly the chewiest cut of New York strip ever. You won't be impressing your friends with the food but will sure WOW them with the bill!

I have been to Alexander Steakhouse several times but this last one was hands down the best meal and the best steak I have had in a while. We had the waigyu sampler and OMG I went to heaven and back...it was delicious and so tender the meat melts in your mouth.The appetizers are delicious as well, the fries are amazing and even the cotton candy at the end is great.The service is always top notch and that's why we use this restaurant a lot for business entertaining.I highly recommend this place you will not be sorry you paid all that money for your meal as this place is NOT cheap. However, like I said in the tittle, worth every penny.

Kidding of course. I like eating good quality meat and this place served the very best. I ordered one of the top pieces of US meat and just to make sure, a very nice piece of Kobe beef. The US steak was brilliant and well cooked. Just perfectly crisp and moist and tasty. The Kobe was off the scale. I had eaten some pretend Kobe but this was just baller. The wine and servers were brilliant and helpful and made arrangements to increase my group instantly. I arrived with 8 instead of 5 and it was no problem. The pre-dinner drinks were also well prepared... and moisted the appetite bueno.If in San Francisco and you want meat, I would say, go here. Pricey? Yes. But if you are going to eat meat, may as well make it the best meat you can get.

I eat a steak once a year so it has to be good when I do -- and this was. Great experience -- not cheap by my Midwest standards... But well worth it. Lots of little samples which were generally amazing (the duck fat custard not so much -- but three different breads in small portions, and the side of Brussels sprouts was amazing as was the twice scalloped potato). The waiter was knowledgable which was helpful -- they have a Japanese take and a selection of smaller regional wines. If you don't mind spending some money on a great dining red meat experience I don't think you can go wrong here!

As always the steaks were great. The same unfortunately cannot be said for the service. My partner ordered an asparagus salad with her steak (actually a starter dish). What arrived was a small side salad which we sent back. There was barely an apology but they said the salad would be right out. When we had almost finished our meal we called the waiter over to cancel the salad. Again barely an apology. Then the bill arrived and there was the asparagus salad! We didn't even get offered a cup of coffee as compensation. The staff need to be trained to take ownership of a problem and sort it. Rather spoilt the meal and we will be going to other steakhouses in San Francisco in future.

Went here for a business meal with 5 other colleagues the other night. A great 'formal' yet informal restaurant. Fabulous range of steaks on the menu and the service was impeccable. Waiters certainly knew their steaks and explained each in detail when we asked about a specific type. Good choice of wines, and our waiter recommended a particular one to try - and he wasn't wrong! Good atmosphere. Would highly recommend - but do book beforehand as it does get busy.

Visited this restaurant whilst on holiday in San Francisco. The menu offers a wide range of steaks, including some 9-11 types of wagyu beef.On the night, a special 4 ounce Tomahawk wagyu steak was available, and gave this a go - simply amazing! All other food (including starters) were of a very high standard, however, I must admit, the portion size of the Australian wagyu steak on the menu is pretty small and would expect that (since the size of this steak is not written on the menu), our server would have at least warned us of the size of this dish.Wine list in very vast, however wines are extremely prices here so watch out.All in all, an excellent meal, with great service and ambiance. Definitely watch out for an Alexander's Steakhouse if in the US.

I had dinner with a business associate and two clients. I arrived early. The bar staff was very attentive and recommended excellent choices for drinks. If you need a freshen up on which Scotch or Bourbon is top knotch and suited for your taste, then ask these guys what would be good.The food was exceptional ! We had most of the appetizers as well as a mix of the Coby and regular steaks. Mouth watering meal ! The service was great and the food was over the top good ! Try the chocolate desert. Wow !

Excellent dinner. 5 men, on business, tired of the typical steakhouse. We found it here. Every dish was different from what we expected. Different in a good way. From hamachi shooters to Kumamoto oysters with beet ginger gelee, this was the best. 11 grades of Kobe beef, plus several excellent steaks from the U S heartland. Fish, prime rib. Artfully delicious desserts. Excellent wine list, whiskeys, etc.

We arrived early for our reservation time. No problem... we were seated promptly.We had a nice view of the open kitchen.We chose this restaurant because they serve multiple varieties of Kobe and wagyu steaks.We started with appetizers;- Hamachi shooters - excellent!- Uni toast - superb- Tempura short ribs - goodThen entrees;- A5 kobe filet (3 oz)- Australian Wagyu filet (3 Oz)- US Wagyu strip steak (3 oz)- US prime porterhouse with bone marrowWe wanted to taste and compare the different kinds of steaks side by side.This was a bit expensive ($95 to $145 per each steak selection).Service was excellent... (attentive but not creepy). Each dish was described while being served.Corkage was $35/ bottle. Their wine list was quite nice for those who wish to order at the restaurant.We really enjoyed this dining experience and would highly recommend this restaurant.The only down side was that the bill came to $800 for our table of 3.

Top five prime rib of all time!

My cousin and I both ordered the 20 oz. prime rib. I eat at steakhouses regularly and in recent years, the prime rib is fair at best. This is true old school, high quality, perfectly cooked, mouth watering meal. The three horseradish sauces on the side were so delicious, but we hardly used them as the meat was too buttery delicious on its own. We ordered three sides for three of us which was way too much. Our server could not have been more helpful. Overall, one of the best meals in a restaurant I've had in years.Thank you Alexander's!

My wife and I ate at Alexander's for the first time last night and simply loved it. The service was excellent and as many people state, the restaurant goes above and beyond to make you feel welcome. We received several items from the chef that were comp'ed including champagne and a dessert.This place focuses on fine details which is what I loved.We ordered the Tomahawk which is a two pound ribeye with a bone that protrudes about a foot. The meat was excellent and the presentation was superb.We will definitely be back.

Four adutls and two young teens all find delights at Alexander's. Our third visit, the menu still delights. Great apps of a unique Caesar's salad, Shoshito peppers, and Hamachi shots. Complete wine list, but markups in the 100%. Awesome entrees - the usual steaks in all shales and sizes, and a few solid fish dishes. Awesome sides- incl truffle mac &amp; cheese, creamed spinach, and a form of scalloped potatoes (Dauphinoise)? What a great waiter - attentive and perfect with the kids. Cotton candy and choc souffle for dessert. Wow!

The Steakhouse does have all the usual steak options but is way better than that as it also has lots of variations of meat can be prepared and how the meat can be combined with other ingredients. All the food was exceptional and although the venue is probably a taxi ride it should not be missed. Wine list also very good.

Dined here as part of a private dinner. Great location downstairs for a larger group (30-40). Meat options were broad and impressive. I had the filet and it was outstanding. Sides that we had were very well done. The deserts were extremely well done, light but with incredible flavor. Staff was great with attentive service. While this was a business visit, I will absolutely come here again for a personal dinner.
