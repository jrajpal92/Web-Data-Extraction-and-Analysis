Tried the double burger and the chicken sandwich. Both were great (chicken sandwich can be spicy if your not accustomed to spicy foods). Garlic fries are nice touch.

The veggie burger was disappointing, dry and bland, the cheese/garlic fries were tastier but could have used more cheese. They had IPA on draught which was a big plus. But disappointingly had NO wifi! It's San Francisco and tech central FFS.I can understand classier places avoiding wifi to encourage people to chat, but help your tourists out and shell out for a router. Please!

Delicious greasy and messy burger. It is a place that is worth going back to or meeting up with friends at. Don't forget their soft serve icecream ..... Perfect way to wash down the yummy burger (any way you like it)

Arrived in SFO with others and we agreed on a burger lunch. Matt knew of this place so we headed there from SFO. Greatest nicely by the counter staff. Crowded tables so we sat outside. Beautiful day. I enjoyed the chicken burger, delicious. The other guys had garlic fries and regular burgers. They were happy too!

One of top 5 burgers I ever tasted. Get combo with burger, garlic fries and drink. Garlic fries are covered with cheese and shredded garlic and are awesome. Not much ambience but who cares?

As we were eating late we opted for the mini burger (4oz), the alternative being the super burger at 8oz. The burgers were by far the juiciest we have had in a long time and the beef was very tender. If you are in the mood for a burger in San Francisco, then don't bother going anywhere else.

Great breakfast sandwiches and homemade donuts. Hard to beat this combination. A variety of egg sandwiches with bacon, sausage, etc. Combinations include a donut made on the premises. Three different types. All good. Eat here for breakfast and you can skip lunch.

Nothing more than great burgers, fries, and milkshakes. I think they also have a chicken and vegetarian option. Come here for cheap lunch or quick dinner. Portions are big, and food is greasy. Splurge for the garlic fries.

I have been to this establishment many times. They serve one of the best burgers in the city. The meat is ground fresh and cooked to order. The menu is limited mostly to burgers with varied toppings, fries, chicken sandwiches. They also serve homemade pickles free of charge.. The prices are also very reasonable. You can either eat in or take away after ordering at the counter.

Soft serve cone similar to Dairy Queen soft serve of my youth

Our review based solely on the soft serve vanilla ice cream as the chocolate and chocolate ribbon weren't available. Don't usually eat plain vanilla anymore, but the ice cream is a wow. (The cone was a typical cardboardy type cone) Although the price is a bit steep for a soft serve ice cream cone, because of the quality of the soft serve ice cream, it is definitely worth it. Strawberry shake uses fresh pureed strawberries and I assume the same soft serve as a base. Out of this world!

Really good value and a great place to sit and people watch from one of the outside tables. We had a cheese burger and their blue cheese special plus garlic fries. Good portions and filling! Staff were helpful on what size burger to order and freely said that one patty would be big enough rather than trying to get us to order bigger sizes!

We went to Super Duper Burgers for lunch one Saturday and loved it! The food was tasty and fresh and good value for money. I had the veggie burger with cheese but there was also an option to add avocado. Would definitely visit again!

The food was AMAZING! Fries thin and crisp, burger filled with a little bit of flavored heaven and the milkshakes...omg, YUM. My burger was organic and clean tasting, deliciousness...with jalepeno poppers and grilled onions! I will have to come back with my husband. Definitely worth the trip.

These guys have the right idea, taking advantage of the whole grass-fed beef movement!Their hamburgers patties are really good, but they need to rethink the condiment upgrades! I ordered avocado and got one tiny, tiny little slice for $1.50. Same situation with the blue cheese upgrade.I don't mind paying more for nice condiments, but you've got to give me a little bit of value for my money.The hip popularity that they are experiencing right now will wear off if people don't find value there. I think that they will be fine if they'll just have a little bit more abundance mentality about it.

Best staff, best soft-serve!

I usually don't report on places I don't really like, trying to always find the positive. However in this case I have to say I don't love Super Duper. Not sure why, but I've never had a burger or fries I love. That doesn't mean the burgers are bad...just not for me. The place is always crowded so I'm sure it's just an oil or fat thing. Sometimes with fast or fried food I don't feel great after. HOWEVER, don't be turned away. Whenever I stay in The Castro, and you know I do often enough (if you read my reviews), I do indeed wander down at the end of a long day before turning in for a chocolate coated soft-serve. Soft serve is also tricky for me. I don't like too much sweet. Damn, I'm something else with food! But Super Duper has great soft serve. So, one day this last trip I wandered down for my before-bed soft serve but just wanted a little something, not a full deal. I got to talking with the woman behind the counter. Wonderful chat I have to add! She tells me about the kid's cup. Adults do the kid's cup because is it like a regular size at any other place. You know, she was right. The regular size is too much for me and the kid's size was perfect. I do cup because I don't do cones, and she poured the chocolate hardening syrup over it. The best! So there you have two tips for a sweet-treat when you've got that hankering. Kid's cup, chocolate syrup (that hardens). Fabulous.

Great burger chain in SF. Was highly recommended by a local and enjoyed my time there. Reminds me of Shake Shack, etc. in NYC. Great location and a lot of space to sit. French fries were delicious as well. Will be back next time in SF!

Fast food can be nasty. Super Duper isn't. A clean restaurant, friendly staff, and interesting choices (including veggie burgers and garlic cheese fries) made the experience very enjoyable. The garlic cheese fries has garlic oil and parm cheese, not the horrible orange goo you get at many ballparks. The chicken sandwich and hamburger we had were very good. Finally, everything was compostable except for the glasses! Not leaving trash behind made me feel even better about eating a fast food meal.

There's a trend now of every new burger place going after the label &quot;gourmet burgers.&quot; Well, this place is not. If &quot;gourmet&quot; is just about the price, maybe. If &quot;gourmet&quot; has to meet a standard of food beyond what you can find in Burger King, though, this place just isn't it.

Came here based on reviews but left disappointed. Very greasy, and not the best quality meat. You'll be wearing this burger for a while, it sticks to your ribs, you can feel it and smell it after it's gone. It's a big messy pile of greasy mess, I had to use a fork and knife. Garlic fries were ok. Overall, average at best.

are worth the effort...and, to be honest, i liked the chicken breast sandwiches better than the burgers, though the burgers, i thought, were pretty good...but the garlic fries are addictive.go ahead. laugh. but don't say i didn't warn you...i am taking NO responsibility for the time you're somewhere at 4 in the am and all of a sudden you get a garlic fry craving...and they're CLOSED!next day when they open they find you a sweating, gelatinous quiver outside their door don't blame ME...!you can order a mini or super...and there's good additions for the burgers/sandwiches(ie jalapenos, grilled onions, tomatoes, lettuce--all free. bacon=1.00).hey...did i mention the garlic fries? oh yeah? did i mention they have cheddar cheese on top?they're malts/shakes are pretty good, too...and they're organic so you can tell your mother that you're eating healthy...

Today I went to Super Duper Burger with my mother for lunch and ordered an Super Duper Burger which I never tried before but, like the menu said it's a messy job the burger is a 8oz burger with two patties and the fixin' after taken two bites the burger fell apart and bun went to mashed but burger was might tasty compared to Sliders down the street. I do enjoyed the atmosphere there it's loud but, tolateble to listen to the person next to you. I give it five stars.

Burger very nice, garlic fries (actually cheese and garlic) good if a little too garlicky. Double choc milkshake thick and chocolatey. Very busy when I went sk noisey plus staff constantly shouting or screeching names to collect food. When quietened down seemed to bring to the table. Fairly quick before collected food and only $13.25 for combo meal.

My wife and I ordered burgers with onions and pickles only, yet they came out with lettuce, tomato and sauce. Was that too much to ask? Garlic fries were a bit soggy, and although we like garlic, the taste overwhelmed us, leaving us feeling nauseated. Service was fast. Restaurant appeared quite dirty.

I'm a huge fan of red meat. Warm weather and a juicy hamburger go hand in hand. That being said- when I say this is the best burger I have ever had- that's a BIG deal!I went to the one a few blocks down from the Embarcadero BART stop- not sure what road that's on. It came recommended by a couple friends who frequent the place so I went. I got the mini burger with sauce, avocado, lettuce and pickles. This burger does not need ketchup. Oh my! Just writing about it makes my mouth water. So tasty, so juicy- not greasy- there's a difference. No fries needed- though I'm sure they are good too. Came on a toasted sesame seed bun.The only thing i'd have them change is the ambiance. It's nothing like Mcy's or BK, but I just didn't want to stay there for too long. This location does have outdoor seating which could only have been nicer if the seats weren't so metal and uncomfortable... if they were more comfy and inviting I would have stayed longer and this would have been a 5+ rating.

Generally there is a crowd inside, you can find it hard to get an empty table. The tables are not clean always. The burger meat is delicious, but verry fatty. Pickle is very bad. Beer is standard.

I'm not sure about previous reviews being so negative...our experience was quite good. The burgers were fresh and with the perfect char flavor but not with alot of salt so you could really savor the full flavor of good quality beef. The buns and condiments were top notch, rivaling In and Out Burgers, in my opinion. The garlic fries were very good, with a great blend of garlic and cheese. Free pickles (home made) are by the ketchup and mustard table. You order at the counter, take a number (and buzzer) and they alert you when your order is ready. While there's not alot of seating, everything moves fast as they have a very alert staff to keep the tables clear and clean. They offer also beer/wine and take all credit cards. This is a great place to stop off for a snack or lunch if your near the Union Square / theatre district and don't want to break the bank at more expensive places. I think this is a winner.
