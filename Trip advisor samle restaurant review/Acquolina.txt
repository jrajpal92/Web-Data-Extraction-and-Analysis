Food ok... service non-existent

With it being thanksgiving Tony's across the road seemed to be closed so we gave this place a go. The initial impression was positive - we were sat down quickly and drinks and water were delivered in good time. That was when the problems started... we both ordered pasta dishes and some bread to nibble on while we waited. I would say I've had shop bought loaves that were much better. After, well a while, and everyone seated around us having been served their food, our waitress asked to double check what our order was. Clearly she had forgotten to order it, but 20 mins later she then tried to make up an excuse that the kitchen doesn't usually serve pasta at this time! This was despite two tables around us having ordered later than us AND received their pasta dishes already. The pasta dishes we later received where OK - nothing great but not awful either. My boyfriend also had all our cutlery dropped on him without even an apology. Overall - wouldn't go back, disappointing.

Pizza here might be of the best texture anywhere on Earth. And it tastes fantastic too. I ordered the margarita pizza with black olives. The pizza was cooked to perfection. Crispy all the way through. A nice layer of tomato sauce with just the right amount of cheese.Only complaint, the olives definitely tasted like sliced canned olives.Service was fast and friendly.

Great spot for pizzas and pasta in Washington Square neighborhood of San Francisco. Went with 2 kids (ages 7 &amp; 4) and everyone had a great time. Good food. Friendly, attentive servers and quick service, which was great because we the kids were tired after long day of sight-seeing. Nice, but not fancy. Indoor and outdoor seating available. Right on the square. A good find!

We were headed for Tony's pizza across the street, but discovered that it was closed on Tues. so we ambled across the street to Acquolina's. It was a great find. We ordered their margherita pizza which was delicious. It had a very thin crust. The service was great and there was no waiting.

We wandered onto little Italy and the smell of pizza left us craving some! A lot of places has crazy wait times but the waiter here was very accommodating and sorted us out with a table with no hassle. Meatballs and pizza were great and tasty wine was available at very reasonable prices. Staff were very attentive and fun, will definitely return if we get the chance.

We were sitting at the bar counter. We love the service, ambiance and our freshly bake focaccia basket. We also ordered a charcuteries plate which comes with delicious homemade Pesto and Pecorino. Ravioli del Casale was my main, it is not light but taste very homemade. The guy working at the bar is so friendly, I suspected he is the boss. He recommended great tasting of local California wine to my boyfriend (not Italian wine, he is unbiased being Italian) and very generous with his sharing of great Italian experiences. His passion and friendness, is giving a sense of happy satisfaction and enjoyment to be here.

This is one of the few restaurants that didn't have the ridiculous hour/2 hour wait for reservations. The food was absolutely delicious. The bruschetta and margherita pizza was an 11/10. By far some of the best pizza I have had. This will definitely be a staple every time I am in the area.

I have to say that this is by far the best pizza I've had! But not only the pizza was amazing... From the moment you cross the door to the bartender, the whole staff and the owner. They make you feel right at home! We were visiting SF and went in for one night. Tonight was our last night in town and could not think of leaving without going there one last name time. Highly recommended!

My husband and I wanted a light dinner and had no idea where To go. We happened upon Aquolina after we were turned away at Tony's pizza across the street. We had a nice dinner, great service in a relaxing place. The Zuppa di mare was great to start and we shared a pizza. Big portions ! Highly recommend !

Our family of 5 (dad, mom and 3 teens) planned to have a nice lunch North Beach at Tony's. But the 45+ minute wait there sent us looking for alternatives. I am so glad we stumbled upon this place across the street. The service and the food was excellent and authentic. We had a great family meal.

It was a very busy Sunday night, and we were cold, tired, hungry and jet lagged having just arrived in San Francisco after a transatlantic flight, so in fairness, this review may be a little harsh on Acquolina. It is a small restaurant and the only table we could get was outside, and we had to wait a while for it. The pizzas and calzone were very good; unfortunately we didn't stay for dessert as it was so uncomfortable where we were seated - a dirty outside table on the sidewalk pushed up against a plastic awning flapping against my head in the breeze, on a slope, with hard uncomfortable chairs and it was really cold and drafty. What made the experience worse was being doused in vapour constantly from the couple on the next table puffing on their e-cigs constantly. The waiter was very friendly though, and I'm sure that if we could have sat inside the experience would have been much nicer, and we'd have eaten and drunk more.

Acquolina, 1600 Stockton St, San Francisco, CAThe restaurant was quite busy during the evening but we were able to be seated.We were served quickly for the drinks but the food took a little while to arrive, but we were in good company so it did not matter to us really.We had Pizza Diavalo and a side salad as the main course which was very tasty but not the best pizza we have ever had.Overall this restaurant was above average.

Having waited with no hope at Tony's we crossed the street and found Acquolina on a saturday evening. We were welcomed with a quick table by the window. The dining hall is wide and comfortable. Service was good. We had burrata, parmigiana, pizza margharita and pizza delicioso. All plates were successful.Our wine was great. The check was ok. We left the place quite happy.I recommend this place to all Frisco visitors.

ACQUOLINA did indeed welcome us in such a warm way! By their entrance the words: LOVE, LIFE, FOOD, WINE, PASSION and PEOPLE are written as if the establishment promise you an experience that resemblance those words of enjoyment. We went originally to eat authentic Italian pizza for lunch, and being from Europe we are quite particular about our Italian restaurants. After lunch, that over exceeded our hopes of Italian authentic pizza on the US continent, our naturally kind waiter offered delicate surprises throughout the evening. Fruit, chees and strawberries went perfect with our after dinner Prosecco. We where treated ROYALY! The live Jazz musicians made the place comfortably lively during the last hours of the night. What started out as a pizza lunch - became an awesome evening! Had a blast! Thank you to Dario Tobia and his family and friends at ACQUOLINA! We have found our new regular &quot;hang out&quot; place, when having time off in San Francisco.

Great bruschetta (simple but light and tasty, drizzled with just enough olive oil), followed by Pizza Dolomiti.This was a lovely pizza with a light crust, truly succulent and tasty. The chillis in oil were a nice touch but pretty powerful. To be taken in moderation.Finally Lynne voted the blueberry panacotta to die for. The Chianti was ok, not celestial and wine is costly in USA.Pleasant service and overall very good value. We'd come again.

We arrived in San Francisco to visit our daughter and we were ravenous! So, our daughter suggested going to Acquolina's for some authentic Italian food. Not only was the food authentic, but the wait staff was also Italian! We ordered the bruschetta appetizer (fresh and delicious, but wanted more than the 4 pieces in the order), a bottle of Chanti (of course, yum) and a margarita pizza to share. The pizza crust was delicious - thin, yet tasty. The sauce...delicious. And of course, LOVE the mozzarella cheese. The restaurant is on a corner of a busy street, so as we sat in our corner table eating and drinking great Italian food, we watched the rest of the world go by through the large windows, which seemed to encapsulate the entire restaurant. Definitely a great place!

We couldn't get into Tony's pizza as we heard that was the best so we thought we would try Acquolina across the street, we had a so, so salad and a very poor tasting pizza. It came out with hardly any topping we had order the ham and mushroom but there must have been a shortage as we could hardly spot the ham or mushroom it was mainly cheese and tomato source, not very good wouldn't go back for sure, but no doubt they get lots of tourist in and out so don't care

We like others were looking at nearby restaurants which were either closed, full, or had ridiculous wait times. At Acquolina we were seated immediately, and received home-made bread on the table. The house salad is fresh lettuce, shaved fennel, grapes, walnuts and orange. We both had pizza which is thin-crust and cooked to crisp perfection. Toppings are generous. The venue itself is on a corner of Washington Square, with big windows and good street views. The interior is high-ceilinged and airy. It's not a white table-cloth place, very informal. The staff are natural and friendly. Good Italian wines. Reasonable prices. Plus a great hat shop next door.

Went there for dinner with my wife. I had a pizza and she had a pasta.Plates were looong to come, about 45 minutes. The pizza was very hard and so thin that you are still hungry after a whole pizza. And I am not a big eater. Pasta was so so, fade and the sauce didn't seem very fresh. Plus it was a very small portion.Service was OK, but really I will not come back.

We went here after intending to go to another nearby restaurant but the wait time was ridiculous. We got in here straight away and had a table outside under the heater which was lovely and warm on a cool night. The pizza was fantastic and so was the house salad. Service was excellent, fast and very friendly. We were so glad to find this little gem. The prices were very reasonable as well

Food overall was excellent. Burrata appetizer is delicious. Salads are generous portions. Squid ink tagliatelle was excellent. My children loved the pasta with butter sauce. Only two downsides....service was a bit slow in bringing the check and the restaurant was hot! Not usually a problem in San Francisco but this time it was. Would return for the food, however.

We had intended to go to another restaurant in that part of North Beach but the wait time was ridiculously long. After trying a couple of other restaurants which proved to have even longer wait times we went to Acquolina and managed to get a table immediately even although the restaurant was clearly pretty busy. We had pizza for dinner (it was a Friday night after all). The pizza was really good, the service was terrific and we had a really good time. For informal dining, this is a great choice of restaurant in a very exciting part of town.

We stopped for a late lunch with our two daughters on a Wednesday. Loved the atmosphere and the fact that one could hear Italian being spoken among the staff (owners perhaps too). Upscale, bright, with inside or outside seating. Their complimentary table bread was unusual but very good. The lunch menu had a good variety, we ordered quickly, but the drinks came out slow. The food was exceptionally good, even though they were simple dishes. Even still, we thought the prices for the meatless dishes were a bit steep for lunch ($15-$20), even by San Fran standards. I'd recommend the place, just be willing to drop some coin.

A friend recommended a restaurant across the street from Acquolina but they had a very long wait. I was a little worried when my son suggested Acquolina. After all, there was no wait to be seated. I feared that said something about the food or the service. I was very pleasantly surprised! The service was fast and friendly. My family of 3 just ordered a Margarita Pizza to share. It was delicious. The crust was super thin and crispy. It was topped with a generous portion of fresh mozzarella and a touch of basil. Light and delicate. Filled with flavor! I don't know how the rest of the menu was but I can say that everything looked and smelled wonderful. If you are looking for a good pizza this is a nice place to dine.

Really a strange experience, too many waiters trying to care for us. They had problems to coordinate, so several mistakes was made. However, when we told them, it was fixed immediately.

We were going to go to Tony's opposite but it was so busy and there was a 1hr 45 min wait. This place looked really nice. Staff were friendly but they were so unorganised that that 4 different members of staff asked us the same questions and had no idea that we had already ordered things. It was so painful to watch staff walking around aimlessly and then running around like headless chickens as they got busier. One of us had the insalata caprese which I am told was nice. 2 of us had a homemade pasta with bolognese sauce. Very bland and disappointing. This should be an easy dish for an Italian restaurant to execute. I now understand why this place was so quiet. I hoped that as it was new hence few reviews, we would be pleasantly surprised.

We were looking for a place to stop for drinks after a day of walking the city. We fortunately stumbled on to this very new restaurant in Little Italy. Dario, the owner was very welcoming and the bartender was amazing. You could tell that he was an authentic &quot;barman&quot; from Italy, where cocktails are as important as food. What was supposed to be a stop for drinks ended up being a stop for a spuntini ( snack). I would highly recommend Aqualina. The pizza looked fabulous as well.

Darius, one of the owners, was visiting every table making sure everyone's dish was to their satisfaction. The table next to us were on their second visit and loved the pizza and the salads (looked really good!) As a native San Franciscan, I will definitely be recommending Aqualina!
