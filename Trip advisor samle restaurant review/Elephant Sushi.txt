Place for sushi lovers, bar only sitting allows you to see the food being prepared.We tried the toro nigiri and a couple of rolls, top quality sushi and casual atmosphere, we loved the place.

I have been told that this is the place for great sushis in San Francisco. The restaurant is small as it is family run. Therefore it can get crowded. I got lucky as solo to go directly to the bar.The rolls were delicious with new combinations of flavors: Sometimes crazy but always goods: flamed sea bass or the red&amp;yellow.Quality has its price and it was really worth it.

Best in town!

Worth the wait walk by early and prepare for an hour wait, but well worth it! Have as much as you can, cause the wait is so long!

Very small informal sushi bar. Most likely you should wait some time prior to being seated but you can have a drink at the easy-going bar next door. It is worth waiting as the sushi is surprisingly different from what you may expect. Innovative, tasteful, fresh and delightfully prepared on the spot. Just try any of the proposals. I had Himalayan Trout, Red &amp; Yellow, Yummy Pocket and Caviar Toro and I was really happy about all of them, with an extra star for some but only as a personal taste bias. A must if you are in Central SF and look for something special yet very informal. The service is also very good.

Excellent experience!

Probably the best sushi I've had! Fresh, flavorful, and satisfying!! Very small and crowded but it added to fun. We sat at the counter and enjoyed watching the sushi being made! Price is fair. Three of us split four sushi rolls. Including tip it was roughly $50. We arrived right at 6 to avoid a long wait ... Would have been worth waiting for! Highly recommend!

Need to line up early (after the gods have smiled on your finding parking spot nearby) to make a reservation that same day around 4&quot;45 PM before their formal opening to walk-ins at 5:30... Ask for their favorite soecials: can NOT go wrong!!

I'm glad I stumbled onto this place. I was staying at a hotel nearby and saw some good reviews so I went to check it out. I had a sashimi bowl and it blew my mind. Everyone that worked there was very friendly as well. I'll definitely be back next the next time I'm in SF.

Located in one of our favorite S.F. neighborhoods, don't be deterred by the exterior. It's perfect. For what they don't put in the outer trappings, they put in the sushi. Yes, get there early because the line starts forming at 5:30. Better yet, call in for a reservation. They call you ahead of time to make sure you're coming, then call your name again to seat you ahead of the line. A mix of young and older customers and no real off-putting hipster vibe. We're seasoned sushi people and everything here was spot on. We also discovered something new, The Flaming Seabass. I know, I know, heated sushi dishes are not for the purist but this one is truly special. Just get it and you won't be disappointed. Trust me, you'll be using the little white spoons to scrape the cracklin's out of the bottom of the dish. Made it on to our all-star list. Great food, great atmosphere and helpful, friendly sushi chefs. And, contrary to some other posts, we didn't find it to be overly expensive.

Make sure to get here before it opens to ensure you get a seat at this small sushi restaurant. Almost every roll is delicious but your wallet might hurt a little bit

The restaurant is very small so prepare to wait a bit. We got lucky and were seated right away. Great atmosphere. It did take probably 30-40 minues for our sushi to come out so that was pretty long but other than that no complaints. Plenty of sushi options. You can't go wrong with choice of sushi -- everything we had was AMAZING. I'll definitely go here again next time I'm in San Francisco.

Great sushi! Different take on the traditional stuff. If you want to venture outside of the transitional California roll (which I love) this is your place. The butter fish was out of this world. White out roll was AMAZING!!

Sea urchin

I love sea urchin and I found a roll here with sea urchin and raw quail eggs, I thought was great, the rice was still warm. Downside, the place looks like a sushi place in Japan, but there is way more counter space for the guests, you order 2 dishes and you need to play Tetris with glasses, bottles, plates and so on

Whenever I'm craving sushi, which is frequently, this is my spot! I bring all my friends from out of town here as the fish is so fresh and just melts in your mouth. Everything is presented well and the service is attentive as there is always a wait outside but it's totally worth it! Mid-week you can sometimes avoid a wait if you get there early.

Really cute restaurant in a really cute suburb

This suburb alone is worth visiting but this is definitely a gem. I ordered 3 dishes and admittedly only 1 was a stand out but I could tell where the chef was trying to go with the other two. The dishes and menu is creative. I'd definitely be back to try the other dishes.Be prepared to wait 1 hr! Just put down ur name, have a drink somewhere and they will call you when your table is ready.The price is pretty moderately priced as well. They do $2 sake bombs which is a shot of sake that gets dropped into a glass of beer. They also do a cheap lychee martini. They only have these two drinks on permanent happy hour but both are good :)

We visited late on a Friday and managed to get a table for two people after a 5-10 minute wait. We ordered three rolls which were all phenomenal. One was flame cooked which was delicious and another one was a spicy shrimp one which was also amazing! Staff were friendly. Would highly recommend and would love to go again.

On our last day of our vacation we had no plans yet for dinner. We just had some nice wine and cheese at Union Larder when we walked outside and passed Elephant sushi. As sushi lover, I immediately suggested to have dinner there. It was not open yet (from 18:00) but some people where already waiting in front of the restaurant. A good sign I hoped. And yes it was! At 18:00 when they opened, the restaurant was filled up right away with everyone that had been waiting.We got our drinks quite quick and ordered a few rolls. We had the Red &amp; Yellow roll, Albacore roll, Red Dragon, salmon sashimi and avocado roll. It all looked very nice and tasted delicious.Perfect dinner! Would recommend it for sure!

Ok so the food here is incredible! Make sure to try the flaming sushi rolls! You can even get sake bombs for $2!!! The sashimi was incredibly fresh! The staff seem a little &quot;standoffish&quot;. However, we kept joking with them and convinced them to do sake bombs with us. It was perfect.The food is extremely well priced also.Can't wait to go back again.

You have to get the butterfish, its a mild fish and they prepare it perfectly. I've been to many high-end sushi destinations and this place does not disappoint. Get there early though it packs out in a hurry.

It is our second visit to Elephant Sushi and there is no doubt that not only do they serve great food, they consistently do it!I highly recommend this place with special kudos to the Beastie Boys, the Himalayan trout, the flaming seabass and the Hamachi truffles.. though I am sure the rest of the menu matches these.To top this off our waitress was acreal charm!

The excellent attentive staff delivers well crafted clever configurations of traditional favorites that exceed expectations. The innovative chefs are playful as they blend the oriental and the occidental. They caper olive oil with sashimi and roasted garlic.the flaming sea bass is a must as the fog rolls in across Russian hill. The blue flame will keep you warm. This is an intimate dining experience that needs to be indulged again and again to appreciate the genius of the menu

The best sushi. My husband and I ordered a couple of selections. Tried these, then ordered a couple more and a few more after that. Our favorites included the sea bass sashimi and the trout on a block of Himalayan sea salt. So good. We went right as it opened so didn't have to wait for a table. Union Larder is across the street for a great glass of wine and noshes if you do need to wait.

Worth the Wait

Aside from the hour-long wait, it was the best sushi experience I've had in a long time. The prices were very reasonable, the fish was fresh, and the serving sizes were good for the prices. They had $5 lychee martinis and $2 sake bombs. They even gave us some free sake! The hostess, Lisa, was very nice and accommodating (even with the crazy wait). I started with the chips &amp; dip (very fresh tuna) , then I had the Himalayan Trout (also fresh and nice presentation) and the grand finale was the Flaming Sea Bass (comes out in a plate on fire!). Both of these plates were absolutely amazing and very filling. The service was great, with a friendly waitress and fast servings. As for the atmosphere, they had awesome reggae playing in the background, dim lighting, and nice blend of modern and traditional setting.

Solid Rolls. Extremely Long Wait. Go when it opens. Closed for Lunch

Thank you Ana at the front desk for accomodating us. We are staying in SF for a week and I found Elephant Sushi on Yelp on the plane ride from NYC to SF. Before I even took off from JFK, Elephant Sushi already looked delicious. But we sadly found out it ws closed two days out of the week and not open for lunch. Basically only opened for 5 days out of the week for 4 hours. What kind of restaurant does this?When we got there we were quoted over a 2 hr wait at 9PM and fortunately we were seated at 9:50PM. I dont think I would be able to wait longer than that. The food there is solid. Get the Yamachi Sashimi appetizer and the flaming sea bass in the foil. That roll is the most delicious out of all the ones we tried and I am a sushi snob. Its more fushion sushi then sushi at its purest form. If you are ok with that, and come early at like 6PM on a weekday, then yes, its a great spot to have dinner. If they quote you an hr wait, you can kill some time by eating at the ice cream shop around the corner. That is delicious and only was a 5 min wait :)

One of the top 5 places for Sushi i&#39;ve ever ate at!

Was given this restaurant as a suggestion by a friend who lives in the bay area. I told her I wanted a top quality sushi place. She said all San Francisco sushi is great, but I need to try this place.For starters its kinda of the tourist path, which I love! I prefer eating like the locals because you tend to get away from the gimmicky places and get a real taste of wherever you may be.So, Elephant Sushi Happened! I cant say enough about this place! I walked up on it and noticed it was closed. But seen it was opening in like 25 minutes. decided to wait it out. It is a very small place seating maybe 20-30 at most. Within the 25 minute wait it went from me and my wife waiting to about 20 of us waiting, So I knew it was gonna be amazing! When we got inside and seated, the handed out a very well presented little sample of &quot;butter fish&quot;. It was amazing. I was instantly on the hook. So we ordered a pretty serious layout for ourselves. Now, I could try to explain the orgasmic flavors flowing through every mouthful, But I will save that for you to experience.
