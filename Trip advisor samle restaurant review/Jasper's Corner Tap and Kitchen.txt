Nice Restaurant and Bar

Ate here at an off time and there were few people here. We ordered chicken wings, tater tots, Classic poutine, Posh (crab hollandaise) poutine and a burger on a pretzel bun. The Posh pouting had black truffle fries. The tater tots were fried in duck fat. The food was good. The classic pouting was far better than the Posh.They had specials on beers. The place was clean including the restrooms, which is always a telling sign. The waiter was very customer focused. This place is looking cates by the Hilton.

We were looking for breakfast and initially walked past this thinking it was just a bar. Well, the bar is in the front, but there is a GREAT breakfast restaurant in the back. Very clean and good service. Biscuits and gravy and the omelet with goat cheese and avocados were favorites. Very clean and fast. Worth the stop.

Beer and Food Acceptable, Convenient, watch your bill

We stopped in for a quick, conventional meal. I had Kale Caesar. It was very good. The beer list was reasonable. My partner had steak and claimed that it was good. The bill was $56. When the return slip arrived for tip and signature, the bill was $90 run on my card. I questioned. After 20 minutes with the waiter and manager, they couldn't clear it and said they had to charge $0.01. OK, but if I hadn't paid attention I was out $30+. They apologized and I will take this at face value, for now. The scene is quiet, pleasant and clearly convenient. I would recommend on food and atmosphere. But, not being able to clear the erroneous bill is a bit disconcerting.

Went for breakfast a couple times as the adjoining hotel gave discounts. The food was average but they serve items on so many plates. The table was too small for breakfast for 4. One plate for breakfast would be nice. One server we had was not rude but was surly at best. Perhaps a bad day but it should not make the patron's day bad too.Stopped for a drink and snack late one evening, very slow service and the drinks were not properly prepared (whiskey in a spanish coffee?) and when mentioning it, we were asked if we were bartenders. Oh and the snack, the burger was over cooked and dried out and the truffle fries were greasy and did not have the parmesan as promised.

Comfort food with a twist, like the buffalo meatloaf, rich and delicious and the tator tots cooked in duck fat served with curry ketchup and old bay mayonnaise. But the most interesting dish was the dessert, caramel popcorn with liquid nitro. The smoke kept rolling out of the dish, cold and sweet and great fun. The decor is urban chic but welcoming. The prices are very reasonable

Sat and waited 15 minutes for a menu or to be waited on - and it was only 1/4 full. It is Dreamforce week have the staff ready to perform and rake in the money across the street from all your opportunity from the Hilton registrations and room blocks. I get San Fran is laid back, but really you own a business to make money...

I was staying at the Serrano for a convention so thought I would try it.I had the pretzel app. It was ok but seemed like it had been microwaved to heat up.The burger was good. I would have that again. Very large and filling.I had one of the speciality cocktails, they change regularly, and it wasn't that good.Service was hard to judge. I'm not sure I I was there at shift change but I had a couple different servers and had to ask for water more than once

The place has a nice urban feel. The menu for breakfast is expansive enough. The staff were thorough. The food was average. I had a full English breakfast. The eggs were under done with water on the plate, the black pudding unpleasant and the beans note to my taste.The cost for the breakfast was in my opinion high once tax and tips were taken into account. I probably won't return.

Came for breakfast with my husband. First thing...the go to the back sign is confusing (a group of 3 guys before us did the same thing of leaving and going 'round' the side of building looking for another door). When we got in we ordered 2 posh benedicts and a portion of black pudding (British note...this is not the same as British black pudding). I eat a lot of egg benedicts and this one was ok - the eggs were good and runny buy the dish as a whole was quite cold. About 5 mins after we left I had a slight pain in my belly so not sure about the hollandaise sauce. My husband was fine so maybe it was just me. Was quite expensive (around $50 including a tea and orange juice). Might return to try as evening bar.

Menu is a bit limited, but all they do is just right: blueberry pancakes come with lemon sabayon, fish &amp; chips are crisp and well seasoned, and there are unusual but tasty things like rabbit with grits. We stayed at the onsite hotel and overcame our usual miserliness to eat breakfast here because everything (including service) was so good.

I kind of think my title says it. Great staff. Great entrees.... but the sides are very lacking. I got fish and chips and an order of corn cobbettes. The fish was well seasoned, battered, and properly cooked (flakey). The fries were dry and over seasoned (bay leaves), the corn cobbettes were cold from the fridge/freezer after cookeing. Presentation of the meal was awesome.So... decent... but I have to be frank, I found nicer places nearby by using Yelp in a prior visit.

The food was very good. All 6 of us really enjoyed it. Samantha was very friendly and helpful. The food prices are a little steep. $18 for a burger (it was excellent though) and $21 for Fish &amp; Chips. However, what really blew me away was the automatic tip of 18% because we were 6 people. I usually tip pretty good (usually 15% or above), but this automatic add-on turns me off. Granted this is San Francisco and they are not the only place who does this.

Breakfast/Brunch - avoid

This looks like it would be a great place to hang out in the evening but avoid for breakfast/brunch. Service was EXTREMELY slow. Nothing special about the food. It was average. I ordered a Bloody Mary. Wow, the level of spice in that thing was crazy. I let it sit through our entire breakfast until most of the ice melted and was able to drink it. I love spice but that was crazy. Would love to visit again in the evening but really, Jasper's, don't offer breakfast unless you have the staff to cover the tables adequately. Many people left frustrated while we were there (either never received menus or waiter never came to take their order). A ton of lost business lost.

Place was sparsely crowded on a Thursday night. We easily got a table for 6 and shared a variety of dishes while drinking beers. The beers are fine although not as extensive of a list as I'd thought. Food was mixed: nice meat and cheese platter but the fries dishes weren't as good.

A late lunch

We stopped in about 2:45 pm for a late lunch; we had just gotten into town. The menu was just what we had in mind: something different and funky. We started with two cocktails. They were superbly prepared. I had an old-fashioned with Makers Mark (which can never fail) and my daughter had a cocktail from the menu, which was also fresh and delicious. It was fun watching the preparation of both. As we sipped on the drinks for a bit, we absorbed the surroundings and placed an order for the &quot;poutine&quot;. When it arrived it was hot and well prepared with the brown gravy, cheese curds and the tender pulled pork! The fries were thick and well matched with the toppings. Nothing became soggy! Then we shared a crab cake po-boy which was equally delicious. It had a tangy slaw that pulled it all together. Since we were in there at an odd time, there wasn't much of a crowd. We were attended to quite nicely and our experience was awesome!

Had the truffle fries which were disappointing. Sat at the bar and service was a little slow considering one other group of 4 at the bar and the manager was behind the bar as well and never acknowledged us.

Stopped in for a much needed meal. This nice looking corner spot located across the street from my hotel seemed perfect! The location was great, the prices were great, the service was great, and the atmosphere was great...this was CLOSE to a great experience, UNTIL the food came! An utter disappointment!The order of fries while tasty, most of the fries were no longer than two tater tots put together. The side salad with oversized shrimp (added cost - figured it would be salad sized) was alright, but nothing spectacular. The wings - I went because I wanted wings!!! I was so horribly let down! The flavoring was not satisfying!Great staff, great atmosphere - unimpressive food!

Stayed at the Serrano and stopped in for lunch and a cocktail. The service was friendly and the drinks were decent, however the food was below average compared to the price.My guest and I ordered the duck fat tater tots, the Bison Meat Loaf and a Cobb salad. The tots seemed as if they had been quickly microwaved as the Parmesan on top was barley melted and the tots were lukewarm. The salad was pretty bland and not impressive. My guest had the meat loaf. It was tender but heavy for lunch and lacked seasoning.I decided to give this place a second chance so my guest and I stopped in for breakfast - equally disappointing but with poor service. We sat aimlessly at our table waiting for someone to take our order. After about 15 mins one of two servers finally appeared. I ordered the Eggs Benedict and my guest had the American Breakfast. The poached eggs on my Benedict were prepared well however it was placed on a soggy cold english muffin..not very appetizing. My guests eggs were cooked with so much cooking spray that it gave the eggs a strange taste. The strange eggs were accompanied by thin strips of frozen bacon (like the kind you get at hotel continental breakfasts for free), potatoes and toast. For the price, this is the most sad breakfast I have ever had. If you're planning on having breakfast, I think your money can be better spent somewhere else.

If you ever need a tasty, low key, non-crazy option for Mother's Day brunch, this is it. I believe you can even reserve tables (I saw some tables near the bar with &quot;reserved&quot; on it, but please do double check). We had brunch here on Mother's Day and it was nice. The service was prompt, it wasn't crazy busy like every other restaurant, and the food was delish - a nice mix of sweet and savory options.

You can set at the window and look out at the street and people so its a good spot for people watching. It's attached to the Serrano Hotel so if you're staying there you don't have to step outside to get to Jasper's.

With all of the dining options in San Francisco this is one you can skip with confidence. Only two saving graces to our recent visit: the Pilsner Urquell was delicious and the waiter was friendly. I almost felt sorry for him having to peddle a dreadful menu tha was not even Medicare in quality. So if you must visit go for a beer and eat somewhere else.

Awful Food

Terrible service from unfriendly, rude staff and the food was quite frankly disgusting. The poor level of cleanliness on the floors raised concern around the level of cleanliness in areas out of sight of the customer!. I chose a dish that would be very hard to get wrong...fish and chips, yet they did. For $24 dollars one would expect for the food to at least be edible. However the batter was overcooked surrounding what was obviously poorly sourced frozen '????'. I don't believe it was what was described. Eat anywhere but here.

This small restaurant is a gem! Conveniently located right across from the Hilton San Francisco Union Square, Jasper's menu is eclectic and affordable. I dined with a group of colleagues at lunchtime on a Thursday, and there was adequate seating. There were enough interesting (and unique!) items on the menu that I had trouble selecting. And interestingly enough the prices were quite reasonable by any standard. Recommended.

I tried Jaspers twice during the week that I was in SF. The food was delicious. The first meal I had the Chicken Pot Pie. The Chef was roaming around, so I asked a question about the flavor, and he was amazed that I was able to pick out the distinct citrus flavor. Yes, he said he uses a little lemon in cooking the chicken and it was a fabulous meal. The second time I ate here I had their burger. It was a very developed sandwich with great flavor.

Decent Food, Loud, and Subpar Service
Rating: 3
Date: March 20, 2016

I ate here on a recommendation from the concierge at the hotel. It sounded like a quirky, but potentially delicious menu. The have a decent size drink list with a good mixture of drink types. The food menu is definitely American with a Southern influence. Even the dessert menu is &quot;eclectic.&quot; I have to say that they actually have a pretty good mix of items with a little bit of adventure for those that are used to standard American fare. The food itself isn't bad, but did leave me a little disappointed. I had the bison meatloaf which was moist, cooked great, and just the right portion size. However, I really wanted some green on the plate in some form--preferably something with crunch to counter the &quot;softness&quot; of the meal. I think broccoli, carrots, or even a spring medley would be perfect.Now the reason for the average rating: the place was loud. Like really loud. Very difficult to talk even when sitting next to the other person. And then there was the service. I really try not to ding servers as I was one myself once. But we sat waiting for service several times during dinner, and a couple times I witnessed my server &quot;fooling around&quot; with a couple other servers instead of checking on customers. I understand there are slow times at restaurants, but if you are going to &quot;fool around,&quot; at least get out of the view of the patrons.

After hearing good things about this &quot;creative gastropub&quot; we decided to try it for lunch. We were seated at a table that was filthy and we asked for it to be cleaned when we ordered our drinks. The drinks were served and we asked again for the table to cleaned. The server returned wiped the table took our order and disappeared. About 20 minutes later our food was delivered w/o a word from the waiter. The dishes were very tasty and portions were amble, thus the three stars. After waiting too long for the check, I got up and tracked down the manager, who &quot;tossed&quot; the check on the table and left. Again, without a word. After paying we left with a comment that food alone does not a good restaurant experience make. Will not return.

While the menu is not super extensive, it has some surprisingly unusual gems on it. I wish I had tried the fried pig ears, but had room only for the tater tots fried in duck fat (Best tater tots EVER), and the game meat pot pie with the bone marrow chimney. Wonderful crust, but the peas inside looked like they suffered either from the canning process or over-cooking. I don't recall the name of the local bourbon-barrel-aged stout that was on tap, but it was a pint of chocolatey goodness with a fine bourbon finish.

This place would have received a fourth star from me had they not ignored me for twenty minutes today during happy hour in an otherwise near empty bar. Then, after ordering, waited another ten minutes and still no drink. Finally just got up and left. Sad because their food is pretty good. I'd eaten there twice previously, once for breakfast (yum) and a second time for dinner (also yum).

Practically empty on a Sunday evening, but oh so close to my hotel. My food was average, my beers were excellent. The biggest challenge they had during my visit was the lack of personality in their employees. It got to be almost amusing seeing how slow they moved, how few facial expressions and how little voice inflection they presented in their interactions. If this place got a jolt of energy or some active management it could definitely turn the corner.

You enter and are left wondering if you just sit down or wait to be seated - a seated couple laughed and informed us 'you just have to sit yourself down we did the same guys' - more staff presence would be better. Staff are hard to understand and seem to find it hard to understand the british accent in return. American breakfast is good but not consistent, the second visit we had was lukewarm borderline cold. Overall a good little breakfast spot but more presence in the dining areas would go a long way and emphasis on providing better service would make dining here more enjoyable - a general observation is that they tend to congregate in the back areas. Customer focus?

We stumbled upon this restaurant while roaming around the Union Square area looking for dinner on our last evening here.We sat inside in their dining area but the bar seemed a bustling and happening place too. They have a good seasonal beer selection but their cocktails are worth a try as well. 'Streets of Saigon' tasted like Thai green curry put into a glass!The fried green avocados are good to start with. They have a 'better for you' burger which I thoroughly recommend. My wife had the pappardelle which was delicious as well.Overall a great meal with efficient service.

Worst service ever

The worst service that I have had, possibly ever. Food was delivered without any utensils and when we asked for some, we were told &quot;it's not not my fault and problem&quot;. We had to take utensils off the empty tables near us. Additionally, the waitress came around once every about 30 minutes even though empty plates and drinks piled up on the table. What should have been an hour and half meal took nearly 3 hrs.

My friends and I went here for lunch and enjoyed our food a lot (I had the grilled cheese). I was very impressed with the presentation of the food, but disappointed in the service. Our waiter came over once every 20 minutes, and took almost 20 minutes to bring the bill after we asked for it. The restaurant was serving brunch at 1:30 PM, and when I asked for something off the regular menu, they let me choose out of 3 things. Seemed strange given it was already later in the afternoon.

We were in San Francisco to celebrate our wedding anniversary. I don't need to be wined and dined but love sharing small plates with my sweetie with a great cocktail or two and not feel rushed. If we squat on your table we will tip accordingly. We made a reservation to be sure we had a table. Cocktail and beer menu are extensive servers had great recommendations based on what we initiated we liked along with the small plates. We never felt rushed but the server was attentive. We'll be back next time we are in San Francisco.

We mistakenly opted for a meal here as we were staying in the hotel. The room was dark and it was hard to see the menu. The staff were disorganised, we had to ask three times for the fifth of five drinks; it was only an apple juice. There was no atmosphere, no music, we couldn't really see our food. Just as well, some was nice and well cooked other aspects were not. In the end we just wanted to leave. It was also very expensive, for what it was.

Our Concierge recommended Jasper's for a close by brunch. We are staying at the Parc55.

Only needed an alcoholic beverage to complete a great brunch.

My husband and I set up a mini bar crawl for our one night in San Fran so we could explore to area a bit. This was one of our last stops and we enjoyed it! We were there on a Thursday night and it was pretty empty. Good selection of drinks. We got the soft warm pretzel which was so tasty (cheese fondue!), the sliders which were good, but not great, and the smoky mac and cheese which was very good. The service was excellent and they played good jams. Very close to the Hilton in Union Square so it was a convenient last stop on our tour.

after coming back from Honolulu we had diner in this restaurant. The food they served looked nices and tasted very well. My wife had ordered mussels and she found out the taste was not so good.The waitress took care of it very well but at the end my wife decided not to eat it as with mussels and shrimps you must be carefull once the taste is different and strong.The waitress took it away and to make a long story short she did not put it on the bill. Perfect. For her information: it were not the mussels but the taste from the saus.The beer I had: Pillsner Urquelle was perfect and tasted like the Tjech Butweiser.A good place to good and the service is very good.

When I visited Jasper's last month the server looked at me like I was crazy when I asked for a Chicago Dog. He told me he'd worked there a &quot;long time&quot; and they've never had a Chicago Dog. I told him I've eaten @Jasper's for a few years now and always order it. Ultimately the manager settled it for us - no more Chicago Dog. I ordered the sliders instead, and was disappointed mostly because it wasn't a succulent Chicago Dog. I have no reason to venture into Tenderloin now.

Bad bad food. I had the j burger, it was dripping in so much fatty oil that you could hardly taste the frozen patty in the wet bun. Gag-tastic. There are at least two great places (Taylor street coffee shop and urban tavern) in spitting distance so go there instead. The girl who served us also didn't know the menu too well and advised me 'that's how the burgers are?' When I said it was gross. Overpriced as you could get better on a sidewalk.

I almost gave four stars, but then asked myself &quot;what more did you want?&quot; The answer: nothing. Bartender Nicolas (according to my receipt) could not have been nicer or more friendly and helpful. He saw Yelp on my screen and immediately asked if I wanted the free Jasper Fries. We discussed the characteristics of the Knee Deep Simtra Imperial IPA, and he recommended a very good red (Ninkasi Believer) for my second beer. The J Burger was cooked to order, juicy and delicious. The fries were enough for three of me. If you are staying in the Hilton or elsewhere near Union Square, put Jasper's on your itinerary. Last thing: people say it's more expensive than it should be? I say it's in San Francisco; were you expecting a bargain?

We went to Jasper's because it was the closest to our hotel.The food was good, but overpriced. The air conditioning was on full blast - and most of us Europeans had to keep our jackets on throughout the evening.You can't smoke inside (as is the case almost everywhere in the US), so you need to go outside if you want to smoke. Every one of my friends was approached either by a homeless person or a prostitute while smoking outside of Jasper's. I know it's not the pub's fault, but it says a lot about the area the hotel &amp; bar are located in.The waitress and barman were nice, though, and the atmosphere was ok. If you don't want to go too far from Serrano hotel, Jasper's is an ok place to have dinner / drinks.

Stopped in here one night on the way home and was nicely surprised, the service is good, not pushy or fast. We had two really interesting and tasty cocktails. the food looked good and the prices were reasonable but it was bit late for us to eat. It is nice and open, lots of seats and lots of place to stand for a bar that is not terribly large, but it is well layed out and works well, Lighting was decent, you could see across the whole bar with this layout. The music was a bit loud but did not impede conversation. Will remember this nice little corner bar in the future.

On our third night at the Serrano Hotel, we thought we'd give this restaurant a try especially since their menu had been staring us in the face for days. Well, that menu is out of date! We ordered a cheese burger with fries, and the Crispy Piggy with fries. Both were underwhelming. I said well done, they brought the burger to me medium rare, taste was decent. The Piggy fingers were more like bite size crispy pork, the fries were good. The servers were so dressed down we didn't know who was who. Our waiter wore a beanie. The best thing we ordered was the bread pudding, delicious! Would only ever consider visiting again for the dessert.

I love Jaspers because it is relaxed and casual, friendly, good food, fun drinks and nice atmosphere. Sometimes we go early just to get a table immediately and have a J Burger - a very tasty hamburger. Jaspers serves one of my most favorite burgers in the City. Sometimes we'll drop in during peak hours and have a cocktail while waiting for a seat. Bartenders are knowledgeable and will help you select a cocktail or beer to your liking. The beer list is good. Most often, we get a reservation, which is easy to get, and they always have our seats available when we arrive. My favorite foods are: the J Burger, the salmon (they include lots of veggies with the plate), poutine, and fish and chips.

My husband and I took our 3 boys (15, 13, 11) to an early dinner at Jasper's before seeing a show at the Curren. As we arrived at 5pm it was not crowded. We thought it was a little weird for a Friday night, but then realized the majority of the restaurant was closed for a private party. The service was terrific. Their menu had just changed and my son wanted something that was not currently offered. Our server/kitchen worked it out and my son was happy. The food was good, and great for kids ... fish n chips, burgers and hot dogs. The vibe was fun--very downtown SF. And they have a great bar ... cocktails were excellent. I would go back.

I was staying at Serrano Hotel, and was walking in Union Square, when I noticed that a comment on a Trip Advisor member question said that Jasper's was one of their favorite restaurants near Union Square - so that was very convenient for me. So I had dinner there.They have an excellent selection of craft beers on draft. I had the steak and fries, and the steak was absolutely excellent. The service was friendly and I felt taken care of.The only drawback is that it was a bit pricey to me, but they may just be average downtown San Francisco prices, so I wouldn't let that hold you back. I would still recommend this place for sure.

We came across Jaspers whilst walking around looking for somewhere to eat. It was a cool place that had a good vibe and atmosphere.We took two seats at the bar and the bartender was very welcoming and explained the drinks available and also items on the menu. We both went for local beers and settled on sharing a burger and the sweet fry/regular fry appetiser. The bar tender offered to get the burger split for us which was great as many places frown when you ask!The burgers arrived on separate plates and they had given us a portion of fries each plus the app. The burger was huge and overall the food was really good. The beers tasted good so we went for another!When the check came it was very reasonable. You have to check this place out!

Walking to the Golden Gate Theater we dropped by for happy hour prior attending the musical Pipin.We had the happy hours specials of sliders and French fries. A super cold martini and a diet soda were also ordered. The restaurant was jammed and we were seated at a high table for two near the bar. Service was prompt and efficient. Our wait person was both charming and a delight. We were just about the oldest folks in this popular corner spot.We certainly will stop in again when staying in the City for the weekend.

Used this for breakfast whilst staying at Serrano Hotel - food is fine but the service provided by the two young men running front of house is plain poor. Lost orders, little enthusiasm and no great effort being made. Chaps, if you don't want the job move over and give someone else a chance!

I attended a private cocktail event here &amp; want to call out the exceptional service the bar provided. They were thoughtful in their recommendations around wine selections and very attentive -- I never waited for anything or failed to be impressed by their selection based on my preferences. I did not get a chance to sample the food (too busy talking) but would return in the future just based on their knowledge of wines.

Visited this eatery last evening and was incredibly disappointed!!! The menu is very, very limited and particular to specific preferences! Not much choice if u don't eat meat! The service was acceptable, if very slow!!! However, my issue is with the drinks! They advertise one price and charge another!!! Be very careful and check ur bill before u pay! As a visitor to San Francisco, I feel as though I have been taken advantage of!!! Very, very disappointing!!!!

I ate there a couple of times whilst staying at the nearby Hilton. Even late at night it was still a nice easy place to eat. Service was good and food even better for what I wanted. Had a HUGE cobb salad which was delicious and also great burger. Beer was tasty too! Food came promptly and was obviously freshly made. Ambience was good - nice easy going 'crowd' of other people in the bar - but not so much I couldn't read my book whilst eating. Would definitely recommend it.

We arrived in to San Francisco late and wanted to grab a quick bit to eat. Jaspers was accross the street from where we were staying. The staff was friendly and the food was delicious. The devilled eggs and poutine were my favorites but everything we ordered was good. Had a bunch of different appetizers and ate family style with another couple. I would definitely recommend this place.

We visited this bar over the street from our hotel. We didn't make a reservation for food when visiting the first time and so were seated in a quiet seating area away from the main bar. While the food and beer was good the atmosphere of the place was somewhat lost. We revisited for a post shopping beer the following day and had beers and nibbles at the bar. Again they were good but it was like being in a different bar, more lively and appealing than being somewhat out of it the night before. Good place for a beer / cocktail and food if not after anything special.

Stopped in before a show as Jasper's is walking distance to the theatre. Cool &quot;taphouse&quot; atmosphere. Jasper's Manhattan was first rate. I had the flank steak which was frankly unimpressive. It was prepared as ordered but turned out to be tough, hard to manage without a steak knife. The side of sprouts was well prepared. While the menu extends into some interesting entrees, my impression is that the better choice would have been to just order a burger. As the bar and dining area filled for a Saturday night, our (cordial) server disappeared and service slowed to a crawl. My friends all seemed to be happy with their meals.

The place is loud, The Niners were on the tube &amp; everyone was watching the game.The Burgers and the Parmesan truffle fries were were outstanding ! I had this tap on our to do list as the French fries/ frites were voted number 3 in the USA.

Very disappointing in that while the food is good, the staff isn't well trained and service is hap-hazard.I laughed when our brunch sides of toast arrived. I had ordered white toast as there were only two options (white or wheat) on the menu. My husband is not detail oriented and he asked for sourdough.So the server arrives with both, identical toasts and presents mine as white and his as sourdough.Add to that the fact that the servers didn't deliver everything that came with hub's breakfast (OJ and coffee) and the barkeep couldn't pronounce the winery &quot;Trefethen&quot; and this place is not for me.

Despite the fact that there was a robust gathering of prosperous-looking 20- and 30-somethings in the vicinity of the bar (which we had to fight through to get to our table) we were seated quickly. Those around the bar were clearly enjoying themselves, but not drowning-out-your-conversation noisy. The menu was a mixture of old standbys and unusual items. Overall, &quot;pub&quot; would describe the place best. Our server, Amy, was exceptional...congenial, conversational, attentive (but not suffocating), even offered a running commentary as a demonstration marched by (well, maybe &quot;sauntered&quot; was more descriptive; they seldom march in SF). Despite the fact that the place filled up while we were there, we felt no pressure to surrender our table.

Bad from the start

We came to this bar / restaurant on the recommendation of our hotel. From the start the start we should have known it was going to be bad when the greeter told us there was a wait - we said we were happy to wait and have a drink at the bar. There seemed to be a huge lack of understanding about what we were proposing to do as she started to set up 2 places for us to sit down at the service hatch. We told her we wanted a table to sit down at not a hatch. So a few minutes later she came and found us and said the had a table for us (right at the back ) but it wasn't ready so she would get it bussed for us. We sat at and waited and in the meantime watched another couple who had been behind us get seated in a lovely booth in the thick of it by a different hostess.Our hostess came back and said the table was ready but could we carry the cutlery from the current table!!!! We were a bit shocked but carried them over.Our waiter came over and in fairness to him he was great. The wine we ordered was out of stock so we went with another one, my boyfriend ordered steak, it came 10 minutes after mine arrived at the table so I sat and wait when it did come it was covered in Parmesan ( he doesn't eat cheese and wouldn't have ordered it had he known) so he had to leave his meal. He was offered an alternative but by then we just wanted to get out of there. It's a shame but service was of a really low standard - having come from Vegas and Mammoth Lakes were they seem to do it really well and at a much better price.

I've been in this place many times with my friends. Jasper has a nice selection of beer and cocktails, that are great for a night out with friends, and on St. Patrick day they also has the green beer too. If you go there to eat make sure to get the mussels or the burger, both great in my opinion. The only down side is that sometimes can be a little bit loudy when full.

We were really excited about the food we got at Jasper's, both the entrees and the desserts. Jasper's menu isn't very big, but the meals are well prepared and have a delicious and sometimes even humorous twist (pannacotta with garlic... That was new to me and really WOW).Their selection of beer is quite good. So is the service.But the room itself needs something to reduce the noise. The plain echo of other guests' conversations made Jasper's an incredibly noisy place and reduced our enjoyment considerably and made our own conversations difficult. In spite of an extraordinary good meal I can only give four dots.

Stopped in for breakfast, and had a good time. The service was friendly and fast, the portions were really generous, and the food was good.I had the American breakfast which was too big to finish. My girlfriend had one egg scrambled and breakfast potatoes. The scrambled egg was more like three eggs, and the breakfast potatoes were a breakfast all on their own. We both also received toast with butter and preserves, which we didn't expect. It was a nice touch to hold us over until the meals came.The food was good- everything was perfectly cooked and seasoned. The sausage and breakfast potatoes were fantastic, and my eggs were exactly what I needed for the day!

Food and service was OK but it wasn't a comfortable place to eat. This is simply an dining area adjoining a bar although it's under the Serrano Hotel and is promoted to guests as the restaurant. Very dark plain drab plastered walls which affected the accoustics and sometimes got very very noisy. The weather was hot at this time and you couldn't avoid the aircon which made it feel like you were sitting in a refrigerator. When you first walked in it was difficult to tell the waitstaff from other customers as they were dressed so casually, however they were keen to please.

So I was convinced by one the reviews that I read in the mobile app of TripAdvisor. I entered the restaurant and after more than 10 minutes one waiter approached me. I was a little bit upset (and hungry).The place is nice, nice music, good vibe. The table smelled like chlorine and the place had a overall smell of fish 'n chips, oil, I don't know. Anyways I asked for a Cobb Salad and a small tomato soup. The bottle of water was a nice detail.Soup was ok, but the Cobb salad was tasteless, I tried adding more salt, but even the beacon chips and the croutons tasted like being in the fridge all day. So I returned the food.Waiter was fine, but I couldn't believe they charged me for the soup ($4), after I told him that it was the worst Cobb salad I've ever tasted.Anyways, I wouldn't recommend this place for eating. If you want to grab a beer, perhaps.

That really didn't matter to me, because I had the Mandarin Mule and it was mixed very well!We ordered the pretzel and the dipping sauce were so good. The pretzel was warm and soft. The fried pickles were different, because they were not sliced, but were spears. The sauce was sweet and spicy which really complimented the tart taste of the pickle.Service and atmosphere were both very nice.

We had breakfast at Jasper's several mornings, as the Continental breakfast was included in our Serrano Hotel package. You received a nice cup of fresh fruit, coffee and juice, and your choice of bagel, toast, croissant. My advice - don't choose the bagel! It was tasteless cardboard but the sourdough toast was good. My husband had the oatmeal and liked it a lot. I tried the heirloom grains since others on TA had raved about them - yuck! It was like tasteless wild rice to me and not something I'd EVER order again! We had dinner here one night and I enjoyed a couple of the sliders, tasty fries, and a very good salad. My husband had the fish and chips and enjoyed. You can get a small beer for $3, which I liked and I thought their prices overall were very reasonable. It's a casual place with a concrete floor but as others mention, is pretty lively in the evening.

We were staying in the attached hotel, arrived on Saturday evening after an 11hr flight and just wanted some American beer and food. Arrived about 6pm and easily got a table, really good, friendly atmosphere but found the drinks menu was a little limited. We ordered food after a while, and again felt the food menu was a little limited. The food was OK when it arrived, but portion sizes were surprisingly small, and not reflected in the price.I felt the waitress was quite attentive to the 2 guys in our group appearing as soon as their glasses were empty, but I had to actively get her attention for drink orders which was a bit annoying.Not bad, but not great.

When they heard we were staying at the Kimpton they said, Jasper's would be a great place to meet.Three of us had the Negroni - on tap here! The take Plymouth Gin, Campari, and sweet vermouth, throw it into a keg, and voila! Over ice with an orange wedge - delish! Also not sweet, it was a perfect cocktail for me.We decided to stay and have a bite to eat because it was freezing outside (Dec 7 2013) Two of us had the Cheeseburger ($14 grilled all natural beef, jack cheese, ginger dill pickle, brioche bun, garlic aioli, thin cut fries add: bacon / mushroom, $1 each fries: truffle, parmesan &amp; herbs $1 each) one had a mini burger ($3 / 6 / 9 shropshire blue cheese, frisee, sesame bun) and I had the heirloom grain salad ($8, heirloom grains, baby kale, frisee, parsley, mint, tangerine vinaigrette, feta, pickled cauliflower, black cerignola olives, sumach).Hubby and I also had breakfast at the Kitchen three mornings. I'm embarrassed to say I had the steamed heirloom grains (6) all three mornings, they were so good at dinner, I wanted them for breakfast. Exactly the same grains both on the breakfast and dinner menu, but I didn't mind. Hubby had frendh toast $11) once and american breakfast ($16 two eggs any style, breakfast potatoes,apple wood bacon or chicken sausage, toast,coffee or tea, orange or grapefruit juice)The Tap is extremely loud with wall to wall people, but we managed to snag counter seats overlooking the street with no wait. Breakfast, plenty of room. Both are worth trying, use your $10 raid &quot;the minibar or bar coupon&quot; from the Serrano for one of those $9 Negroni's!

Staying in the adjacent hotel. Stopped in three times because Jaspar's is connected to the hotel. Staff were not interested in interacting with the guests. They were all busy doing prep for the evening rush. Very limited menu available before 5:00. Pillars block the view of most of the bar. Overall not a good experience.

We had drinks/snacks and breakfast here while staying at the adjoining Serrano Hotel.The bar snacks (spicy nuts, garlic fries &amp; a slider) were tasty and well presented, the bar was well stocked with a number of top shelf spirits and the drink menu was expansive.Breakfast was delicious and good sized portions. It is evident that they emphasize fresh ingredients in their dishes.The service was friendly, but slow every time we stopped in.

I met a friend for dinner here and neither one of us had ever been. Our waitress was helpful and efficient with the service without being overbearing. We ordered drafts and appetizers which both arrived promptly. The deviled eggs were delicious and the riblettes could be a meal in themselves. We both ordered burgers, a house specialty, for our meals. Cooked to order and flavorful, the burgers were thoroughly enjoyed. I would not order the special fries the next time, but will opt for the mac &amp; cheese which we watched being delivered to another table. The atmosphere was relaxed and the total bill was so reasonable I thought that there had been a mistake. They offer desserts, but we were full from the appetizers and burgers so we did not attempt one but next time, I will pace myself so I can try one of them. There is easy access to a parking garage next door to the restaurant and Jasper's validates which makes the garage a great deal. I live in the City and I have now added this place on my list of quick, delicious places to grab a bite with friends.

We had been sightseeing all over the city and were starving, but wanted something upscale with a good bar selection. We did a little research and discovered this gem located close to Union Square. We called and made a reservation as we were still shopping on Market Street. We didn't have to wait and the place was packed. We loved the atmosphere and the generous drink selections. We had the pork chop with brussels sprouts and the poutine fries. It was delicious!

We ate here on our first night in town (staying at the attached Serrano hotel) because it was convenient and had good reviews. The food was tasty and filling although for the standard I would normally expect it to be a bit cheaper but I guess that is often the risk with hotel bars / restaurants.

Had lunch here yesterday: mid-afternoon it was pretty quiet. Only one sports TV, so we could have a conversation. Started with warm olives ($4) and fries ($3) and flights of beer. The grilled cheese sandwich is amazing: crispy on the outside, melting cheese on the inside, comes with tasty sweet-sour tomato relish. I added avocado, he added pork belly for a really great sandwich. Excellent service. The cocktail list looks great and we will return to try tonight!

Good atmosphere, though a bit warm when it gets busier. Goos mix of clientele on the Friday night I was there - suits from offices, a few trendy types and a few lone drinkers. Standard pub fare. Part of the Kimpton chain of hotels so can charge your room without issuing if you are staying at Serrano. Above average service but that's probably the Kimpton influence.

Dropped by for a quick drink and bite to eat while in the area based on recs from trip advisor. The grilled cheese was amazing...

We went here on reviews about the great hamburgers here. Yes, they were good, not the best, but definitely pretty good. The beer prices were decent and they had a good variety of beers. If you get there early by 6 you are pretty much guaranteed a seat on a Fri or Sat night, however if you are around 8 then its hit or miss.

Jasper's is one of my favorite restaurant / bars in San Francisco. The people you meet there are great, the food is phenomenal, everyone loves the Hot Pretzels but for me it's all about the Grilled Cheese or the Chicago Dogs.Jasper's has a great beer selection which is perfect for kicking back after work. They also make one of the better Manhattan's I've had in the city. Jasper's is one of those places that I stop at every time I'm in San Francisco.

One of the best restaurants I tried
Rating: 5
Date: September 4, 2013

Jasper's is modern and cozy, full of people and lively, so expect more a bar than a restaurant. However, it is one of the best places I ate during my recent stay in the US. As mainly a bar, they have a lavish selection of wines and artisanal beers (try the Drake and the oatmeal one), which they accompany with huge sandwiches or similar dishes. When speaking of sandwiches, forget the basic, standardized, full of mayo, ones of many places. Bread is only the excuse for a rich fish or meat portion, served with vegetables. We tried the tuna one and the (incredibly hot) beer sausage and peppers; another time we took the salads and the desserts, which are characterized by the same originality: e.g. rhubarb and strawberry pies or salt caramel cake. The young members of the staff also deserve a mention for their thoughtfulness. I hope to come again!!

I first read about this place as one of the &quot;best french fries in the US&quot; from Travel &amp; Leisure magazine. So naturally, I was curious and when the opportunity presented itself, I gathered a group willing to check this place out. However, I didn't realize it was Beer Week in the Bay and that they had an event so I wasn't able to make a reservation online. I called and told them that I was from out of town and heard about them from T&amp;L. The host kindly gave me a reservation and squeezed us in before their event started. When the night came, I realized that I miscounted and asked if it was alright to include 2 more people, and again, the host was nice enough to accommodate us. They even gave us a table in the back that was a little more private for our party of 12!And that was only the service, and not the food! I like to thank T&amp;L for not failing me... Jasper's truffle fries were to die for! It was crisp and golden brown to perfection. My entire group agreed! But that's not all, the burgers were juicy enough to eat without any condiments. And the dessert was worth skipping the gym for. It's a little pricey though but a good place to splurge a little nevertheless. My group and I had an awesome dining experience. I don't believe we had any leftovers.

Great restaurant with a decent &quot;American&quot; menu. Good selection of beers too.I ate dinner and breakfast here on a recent trip to San Fransisco. I went with a burger for dinner as that's general a safe bet in an a place that I'm not familiar with. Their J Burger is loaded with rich flavors: blue cheese and bacon onion marmalade.On the breakfast menu, I noticed a couple of items marked gluten free, including the omelet with goat cheese and spinach. Not sure about cross-contamination concerns for Celiacs, but the omelet was delicious.

Read about this place in a Swedish travel book and thought it was worth a try. Would probably not have entered otherwise since it looked crowdy and I wouldn't know if getting a table would be possible. With the book in my hand I went in and managed to get a table. The place was crowded as hell and you could barely hear your own thoughts, but if you don't have all too much to talk about it can almost be nice. It seems to me that restaurants often are this noisy in San Francisco, so it didn't bother me too much. The J-burger was awesome, just like I had read and the waitress was nice. She wasn't as personal and friendly to us as to locals, but still did a good job and knew her menu and beverages. Would go there again if I'd ever go back to SF.

Another Place for Good Small Dishes

We had seen Jasper's previously but didn't go in as we thought it was just a small bar. Fortunately our son, who lives in SF recommedned it as he knows our fondness for small dishes and good wine. Turns out it is more than a small bar - the dining area can't be seen form the street. There didn't seem to be a lot of tourists when we were there but it was somewhat crowed with locals. We were quite pleased with our selections ofSausage bits, Crispy Piggy, Riblettes,Deviled Eggs and Jasper's Fries. The wine was very good - we took the advice of our server who recommended the lower priced California Red. A great discovery this trip. Will try it again next time.

My family and I recently ate at Jasper's while visiting SF on vacation. We were looking for a place for good burgers and the concierege at the Hilton across the street recommended this place. It was a bit of a let down. They only had two burgers on their menu. Both of my teenaged boys were disappointed in their burgers. I had their &quot;Chicago&quot; dog which was also a dissappointment. My wife had a soup and griled cheese. She probably had the best meal of us all. The waitress was attentitve but not very personable, a trait I've noticed of most wait staff in SF. Would I go again? Probably not. Was it horrible, no. Pretty average.

It was my birthday yesterday and when asked what I wanted to do, my response was dinner and a movie. My wife and I work in the entertainment world so it is a real treat when someone else is doing the entertaining! I also wanted somewhere casual that had a good beer menu and a terrific bar and good food. We found all three at Jasper's. My meal started with a nice dark ale from Kona brewing and it was chased with a &quot;Blanche de Bruxelles&quot; - both excellent. Oh right, there was food as well! Try the devilled egg trio - reinvented that age old standard. The chicken liver pate was terrific and for the main course I had a cheeseburger which was cooked exactly the way I wanted it. The only complaint was that the service was a little slow and inexperienced but really, a minor blip in an enjoyable evening.

The volume was LOUD...but it was a fun place. Coming in the front door we were overwhelmed with the noise. We were seated in the back of the restaurant and were able to have a nice conversation. The menu was pretty broad with wonderful, clean food. We thoroughly enjoyed the special salad (large portion easily shared) with fennel, pomegranate seeds and little crouton- like triangles of griddled manchego cheese and a lovely cider vinegar vinaigrette with whole grain mustard. We both ordered the Seared tuna sandwich..we both enjoyed. The piquillo peppers were a wonderful counterpoint to the aioli. We look forward to trying more items from the menu. While we are fine with having a noisy bar, we wish a bit more was done to soften the noise in the restaurant space in back. Even so, we will likely be back for the tasty food. And our service was friendly and efficient.

There was one waitperson. Only the bar area was open for lunch, not the nicer seating area. The menu offered 5 quarter sized cuts of sausages for $5, room temp and unfortunately, delivered with the main meal, not as an appetizer as listed and desired. Also the deviled eggs were delivered 7 minutes after ordering although they were simply retrieved from the refrigerator, as the slight hardening around the edges of the yolk confirmed. The salmon was better than expected for $17 came with lentils. Fish &amp; chips were delicious, not hard from over frying in grease, tender to bite into, accompanied with french fries , $16. The bartender helped out with food service but wasn't informed which table had ordered what so he went between tables looking for the orderers.

Jasper's was busy the Saturday night we were there. There was a line to be seated; lucky for us we had a reservation. The hostess took us right to our table with no waiting for which we were grateful. The waitress was attentive and our food was served promptly. The beer flight was memorable, the salad special delicious. Our main course included innovative burgers and chicken pot pie; all were very good. This place is known for their cocktails and beer list; they don't disappoint. It is a lively scene and therefore is noisy. Not a place for young children, but fine for our teenage son.

The joint was jumping as they say. It was St. Patrick's Day and totally packed with a young hip crowd. But it was so loud you had to scream every word. And I have really good hearing. Nonetheless, the food was exceptional. Jasper's food rating in Zagat's was high and they delivered. Definitely would go again for the food and to see if we can have a conversation next time. Note to owners: try sound-dampening fabrics.

Had dinner at Jasper's after a long week of travel. Was looking forward to a good meal and cocktail and Jasper's delivered. I started with a small salad which had a nice dressing and interesting mix of apples, candied walnuts and tangerine slices. It all worked together well. For dinner, I had a 1/2 chicken with polenta, broccoli rabe and mushroom ragout. It was delicious and caused the group next to me to comment that that it smelled intoxicating. The cocktail menu was extensive and original. It was so good, I planned a return trip.

My husband and I stayed at the Serrano (next door) and visited Jasper's on our first night. The bar staff were friendly and helpful - the waitress (Cindy) was EXCELLENT. Very courteous, not intrusive in the slightest and gave great recommendations. My husband had the J burger and I had the pressed chicken - WOW. Dessert was equally amazing and we could not have been more satisfied with the experience. Ended up returning for dinner another night during our stay and we were just as impressed. Go there and you will not regret it!

What a surprise as the place doesn't look like much. The organic mixed greens is a winner with fruit, hazelnuts, and fresh greens. I was equally surprised at the wonderful grilled cheese sandwich which is more than a grilled cheese sandwich. The relish that is included is great.

I booked this place for our large party in advance of our arrival thinking it would be kind of sports bar atmosphere, perfect for our jet lagged bodies. However, we sat way in the back and it was a really trendy place! Everyone loved it. Delicious food (check out the french fry menu!) and great beer selection, also beer flights available.

The outside of Jasper's is pretty unassuming, but this was a good find right near the Hilton. Went here for lunch solo.

I liked everything about this place. The J Burger was delicious, the service was very friendly yet professional and efficient, and the ambiance was welcoming. It'd be a great place to have dinner with a friend, let your hair down, and reconnect. I did not care for the bangers and mash. I'm not an expert in this dish, but the bangers had a very bitter taste that I didn't like. I was hoping for something more akin to bratwurst or Italian sausage.

We happened into Jasper's after a day of SF sight-seeing around 8pm on a Saturday night without a reservation. The receptionist graciously apologized that all the reserved tables were taken, but we were welcome to hang in the bar, and if any of the bar (non-reserved) tables became available she'd seat us immediately. Almost as quickly, two seats opened up at a large table which we then shared with some other patrons.The wait staff was attentive and friendly, and despite the fact that the place was mobbed was still able to serve our needs promptly. The food, especially the riblets and my wife's burger, was above-average bar food, and Jasper's has a nice array of draft beer options including a few pre-selected flights of different beers as well. Their drink list also has numerous unique cocktails as well, which we opted not to try. Moreover, Jasper's is a good value as well.All in all, Jasper's was a great find. While it would be a challenge for those dining with children, it was a perfect last-minute, we're-hungry, place to go.

My friend and I popped into Jasper's on a Wednesday evening without a reservation as it was close to my hotel. It was quite busy but they had some free tables at the back. It wasn't a great start as it wasn't clear how we should get a table. We and another couple wandered towards the back and got the attention of a waiter (not easy) and were eventually told to go back to the front and wait to be seated. The simple addition of a &quot;wait to be seated&quot; podium-type thing would save this.After this, things went well. The staff were friendly and the food was quick to arrive and quite tasty. At the busiest part of the evening, it was a little difficult to hear each other. I don't think there was any music, it was simply the acoustics of the place when everyone was talking. I couldn't work in that, but I'd eat there again!

My family and I were in SF on December 30, 2012 to see the final showing of The Book of Mormon at the Curran Theater. Showtime was 7:30 PM. We arrived in SF very early, at about 5:00. We went to Jasper's for dinner and was seated right away. We placed our order at 5:30 and we didn't get our food until 6:15. I'm not sure if this is normal for SF, but we were getting worried that we would have to rush.We ordered the calamari appetizer, three bacon cheeseburgers (they forgot the bacon on one of the bacon cheeseburgers) and something else I can't remember. The food was tasty and the service was very pleasant.If not for the long wait for our food and the missing bacon from a bacon cheeseburger, I would have rated Jasper's better than average. I would have liked to have given Jasper's a 3.5 rating, but I just don't think it deserves 4 stars.

Admittedly the restaurant is a little noisy but it isn't offense or too over powering.

A no-nonsense restaurant with a great choice of beers and cocktails; I'd definitely go back.

Service was great, had the steak and it was very tasty as were the fries it came with. Make a reservation, this place was busy on this friday night!

Found this place online and was somewhat skeptical after reading reviews that it was very loud and the food not excellent. Well we found the exact opposite. Maybe it was the day we choose or the time but 7pm the Saturday after Thanksgiving would normally be loud. Service was excellent with the waitress really knowing the menu, the wines and items to recommend.Went with the Salmon which was flavorful and a good size, added the spinach with garlic and it finished it off well.Really liked this place and that it is across from the Hilton on O'Farrell.

I was in town on business and after a few days of conference, I was ready for a solo meal. This place was perfect for that: I sat at the bar and chatted with the friendly bartenders. There was an excellent beer selection, with a good number of local craft brews. I had the smaller garden salad and the smaller fish-and-chips, which were both very good and combined for a very satisfying meal. I watched a Celtics-Heat game (sadly, the Celtics lost) and read my New Yorker and listened to their enjoyable background music (including, happily, the White Stripes). A nice, relaxing evening on the road.

What a great spot! Group business dinner for 10 went off without a hitch, thanks to Jasper's great menu (lots of variety) and a fantastic waitress - Crystal. Jasper's extensive beer list was deemed amazing by the group. Everyone ordered something different from Steak &amp; Frites to Poutine. All agreed that the food was excellent. Portions were generous and prices were fair. That said, a still few had some room for dessert and the Black &amp; Tan and Butterscotch Pudding appeared. The Black &amp; Tan was yummy, but you might want to share as it is rich. To top off the evening, Crystal made it super easy for us to deal with paying by giving us separate checks. Amazing service.

Mmmm, poutine!
Rating: 4
Date: September 18, 2012

Jasper's does a few things very, very well. Their poutine is one of them. For starters, there is a separate Fries menu/order sheet on the table when you sit down. You pick your cut (thin or thick), seasoning and poutine (mushroom and gravy, cheese foundue or chef's choice). We selected the cheese fondue poutine and it was excellent - just the right amount of cheese and cheese curds to give the fries some richness and flavor, without dorwning them. We had several other items from the snacks/starters menu - the warm olives were a hit, as was the warm pretzels with more cheese foundue sauce. The dinner menu is fairly limited, with a handful of sandwiches and entrees to choose from, for the most part classic comfort foods like grilled cheese, burgers, fish and chips. The downside to ordering the fries as a starter is that by the time our dinners came out we were almost too full to eat them. One member of our party thought to save room for dessert and chose the sweet corn beignets with cereal milk ice cream, that was outstanding. Overall, we all enjoyed our meal and found the service to be prompt and attentive.My only complaint about Jasper's was the noise level. It was LOUD. We had reservations and were seated in the dining room, but the noise from the bar (and, to be honest, some of the nearby tables) made it hard to hear each other unless we shouted. If you are looking for a fun, casual place and don't mind noise, Jasper's is for you, but I wouldn't pick it for a romantic evening.

This place was a welcome surprise in the middle of our four day stay in San Francisco. Our reservation was booked using the online system and that night there had been a glitch so the restaurant was being double booked. What could have been potential for diaster and several upset customers was handled with grace and ended up basically seamless. The staff was great and even though we heard the hostess repeat to customer after customer what had happened, her demeanor and poise never wavered. All of the staff was very accomodating and friendly. There were four of us in our party and we all ordered something different, burgers, ahi tuna, pot pies and a variety of appetizers/sides. We all walked away pleased and thought the food to be great. The only not so positive thing I could say is that it is a little loud towards the front, around the bar. If you're hoping a quiet evening out, I'd ask to sit towards the back. Otherwise, this place is a great atmosphere with excellent staff, food and drinks.

This place was a very pleasant surprise. Two of us had the sliders. They were just plain good, and instead of the normal three sliders that most places provide, Jasper's gives you a choice of if you want one, two, or three. Then we had fries. I loved this, they offer all kinds of fries, thin, thick, sweet, and with various toppings. I had the sweet potato with sea salt, my friend had the thin fries.Other folks ordered the Grilled Cheese, and Calamari. Everyone enjoyed their meal. The beer list is extensive. Desserts were also good. We had the Butterscotch Pudding, Strawberry Ice CreamSandwich, and the Beignet. Our waitperson was right on the money and checked in with us regularly. The one drawback, they could use a little more lighting along the wall to enable reading the menu easier. We literally had to use a pocket light.Bottom line: Would eat here again in a heart beat.

Being trapped inside hotels and convention venues for 12-14 hours doesn't give you much time to explore the dining offerings in a locale, so I lean heavily on recommendations from locals. I was told about Jasper's Corner Tap and didn't get around to trying it until my last day in town.Amazing. Their creative combinations and home made focus gave me a dancing delight in my mouth. I tried The Ballpark. A house made sausage. Yum. The appetizer pretzel was tasty, dipped into the melted smoked gouda.The venue is clean and modern. Our waitress was generally friendly, but aloof.I will definitely be eating here again.

My husband and I were in San Francisco recently.We didn't want a big meal and found this restaurant around the corner from our hotel. It's in the Serrano, a Kimpton hotel but it has access to the street without going into the hotel. It was a Thursday night and the bar area which is larger than the restaurant area was busy. We had to wait about a half hour for a table. We went to the bar to wait for our table. Our bartender asked me what I liked in my cocktail and came up with a drink for me. The bartenders there seem to know exactly what they are doing. Eventually we got a table. The food was surprisingly good. We started off with warm soft dough pretzels with a dip and they were very good. I wasn't that hungry so I had the grilled cheese. It was on big pieces of sour dough. I added mushrooms at the waitress's suggestion. The sandwich was really grilled. It was great. I had never had a grilled cheese sandwich like that. I also had the side of Brussels sprout leafs with a little bacon and hazelnuts which were fabulous. My husband raved about his half of chicken dish. I can't remember the dessert we had but I remember it was wonderful. Jasper's is a place that most tourists would pass by unless you were staying in the area like we were. For a hotel restaurant, we thought that the clientele seemed mostly local which we think says something about the quality of the place.

I have been to Jasper's a number of time in my stays in San Fran. Jasper's is located in the Serrano hotel where I have been finding myself staying for the past couple of trips. The atmosphere when I am ther is usually pretty low key which is nice as I usually am getting in from the East coast and are way out front of the usual meal times. The last trip we decided to get a quick bite too eat before venturing out for a normal dinner time. My colleague and I split a burger ... Can't remember which one but I will tell you it doesn't matter ... We had ordered burgers in the past as they are fantastic and paired with their large selection of beers and cocktails you can't go wrong for a light meal or just to sit down and devour a full selection from the menu.

The salad wasn't over the top but was a perfect mix of greens, goat cheese, marconi almonds (a nice up-touch), etc. I asked for their J Burger to substitute what was on the menu (sirloin). No problem. This was a seriously great burger; I had many, this is near the top, Dessert was two ramekins..one with creme brulee, the other chocolate mousse. Everything really was excellent.Nice drink menu and selection of craft beers. Only issue was the not right grouping of beers on the menu; all ales are not remotely the same style; putting belgians and american imperials in the same group as &quot;ales&quot; may be technically correct but also will be very misleading for most.The vibe closer to the bar is much better. The one wall in the dining room looks down a long service corridor; a real decor downer. Put up a partition.

After a day of sightseeing, we were exhausted, so we headed down to Jasper's, which happens to be the restaurant at our hotel. What a pleasant surprise! Jasper's has a knowledgable waitstaff, all of whom were very kind and helpful. The beer list was great, with a full line-up of great brews. The food was a perfect accompaniment. We started with the heirloom salad, which featured delicious tomatoes doused in balsamic, fresh buffalo mozzarella, and a small lemon and arugula salad. It was delicious. I also had the grilled cheese with avocado. It was great comfort food and super-yummy. The fries that I ordered on the side were perfectly seasoned with salt and pepper and extra crispy. My husband had a pork sandwich, which was made in a reuben-style. He raved about how delicious it was. This place was an excellent find.

Stumbled upon Jasper's after a Sunday matinee performance at the ACT Theater. We wanted something other than Grand Cafe or Colibri, so we headed towards Puccini and Pinneti (which BTW, has an amazing happy hour, but that's another review) anyway, passing by Jasper's decided to give it a try. The place is not very appealing and lackluster in the decor department, so we sat at the bar. Great creative cocktails and the diner food was delicious. We ordered the Poutine, a Canadian concoction of french fries with curdled cheese and a rich gravy. The deviled eggs, mini burgers and a grilled cheese sandwich with pork belly and frisee salad were all delicious,. every bite.The young bartenders were very nice and serious about their craft. Good Job!

Went to Jasper's last Friday. It was delightful. Very tasty food of the comfort variety. Extensive bar and reasonable prices. A few blocks off of Union Square, convenient to shopping and the theaters. Wait staff was very friendly and efficient. Every aspect of the experience was excellent.This is not a high end, sophisitcated food, dining experience. It is comfort food that is excellently prepared, at a reasonable price and a very pleasant atmosphere. Everything we ordered was excellent.

Jasper's small plate offerings are best enjoyed when four or more diners can order avariety of dishes. The mac and cheese was particularly noteworthy as were the sliders.Overall, a fun place to dine.

Nice!

Made a meal of small plates at the bar early (6-ish) on a Saturday nite. Everything was delcious. The buttermilk marinated salt and pepper calamari was cooked to perfection, the lemon-caper aioli a nice change from the usual hot peppers or red sauce. Also enjoyed the farro salad with feta, mini-burgers, and soup. Great beer list - tried the Lagunitas IPA. Specialty drinks looked interesting.The menu also includes sandwiches as well as reasonably priced dinners. Service was very good - an enjoyable evening after a long day travelling. Close to Union Square, near the Hilton and adjacent to the Serrano Hotel.
