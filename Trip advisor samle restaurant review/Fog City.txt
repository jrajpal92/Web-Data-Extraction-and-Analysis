I was sceptical of this place when viewing it from the outside. However we had a delicious meal here. The kale salad was excellent, this was followed by their special filet steak dish, which was extremely delicious.Wine selection was great, service was good. It's on the pricey side but worth it for such good quality food.

We went here based on a friend's recommendation. I am so glad we did. The food was off the charts! My husband had the Gnoochi, and he said if all vegetarian dishes were this- he could be a vegetarian. I had grilled porkchops. Also, fabulous. I ate every morsel on my plate. I will say for the price the portions seemed small, but again- the food was so tasty, this could be overlooked as an issue. The atmosphere is very casual. We had reservations, but there was plenty of open seating, we wouldn't have needed it. Our server was friendly, and attentive to our needs. However, several people were part of our experience- all super friendly and pleasant.

In a city the aize of San Fran there are so many choices, but sometimes a repeat performance is worthwhile. I was with business colleagues and they liked the fact that the photos make it look like the Hopper &quot;Phillies&quot; painting.The food is very good, it can be a bit loud during peak periods although the tables in the back are a bit quieter. You can see the Embarcadero from the front windows.Some recommendations, definitely get dessert. The fries are phenomenal. Its just as good at lunch as dinner, and they do have a full bar with a decent selection f affordable wines.I've been many times over the years and am glad they maintaining the quality of food and good service

Fog city continues to improve. Their menu is basic American but done well. Their bar is very well stocked and the service is very good.Their outdoor seating is not great, small 2 sweaters on the sidewalk. Gray for a coffee or cocktail, not so for dinner.Right off the embacadero its a great escape from the tourists.I enjoys it again this past week with a couple of my colleagues. Its comfortable and allows you to enjoy the people you are with.

Having eaten here and enjoyed it thoroughly on our last visit to San Francisco 5 years ago, we had high expectations. While the food was good, portions were a bit small. We probably should have ordered an appetizer, as there was no bread service provided. This was curious, as one would think that a place calling itself a &quot;diner&quot; in a city famous for it's sourdough bread would offer it. Menu choices were much more &quot;fine dining&quot; than diner fare. Prices were definitely not diner prices.

Reservations for 6 - seat us at a table by the front door that seats 8 and has a giant pole separating some of the seats. Not great for conversing. They were NOT busy and they would not move us to another table upon our request. We thought ok move on. This is definitely NOT the same Fog City we remember. Menu was limited and not that many great options as before The comfort food once offered has been replaced with so so options. Service was terrible. Our waiter was not rude but not overly friendly and seemed bothered to take our order. We ordered a round of drinks but was never offered another round. We had great memories of the old Fog City and had brought a couple who had never been even - not impressed. We really were excited to come here but unfortunately will not be back. The makeover inside was beautiful but with all the other options in the City we will choose another place next time.

We only visit the city a couple of times a year. This is the first time we've been to Fog City since it changed from the &quot;diner&quot;. We were not impressed by the food or the service. We liked the appeal of the old style and upscale diner food it used to offer; for a fine dining restaurant there are much better choices so we won't go out of our way to visit again. The drinks were good though.

Once you've worn yourself out on specialty foods, go to Fog City for just good food. Their specialty seems to be that they do regular food really well. There are a few surprises, the Ahi Tartare is really good, but don't order so much that you pass up the Mac &amp; cheese. Ambience is fun, lively and very nice.

I have been to Fog City back when it used to be known as &quot;Fog City Diner&quot;. I was aghast that to hear they were closing with a new concept. Luckily, that idea failed and the current Fog City doesn't stray too far from the original upscale diner concept.The Fog City Burger is always delicious and is what I always get. This time my daughter and I shared a strawberry shortcake which was equally yummy.

I find San Francisco to actually be a hard place to find restaurants, because there are so many places, and so many are either just for tourists or are too hoity toity for my tastes. i find it particularly hard down by the water front, but Fog City is a great alternative, really close to all the stuff on the wharf, but with interesting food that doesn't feel overly fancy. My sons enjoyed the burger and fish tacos, and my falafel sandwich was really good. The aioli combined with the very interesting Japanese twinged fries was also very good, making the fries a very interesting appetizer. Fog City worked nicely for us.

Pleasant walk from ferry building. Great corner building. Decor was upscale yet comfortable. Set in a private booth in the back. Started with deviled eggs and grilled calamari on a bed of corn and veggies. Entrees were enormous burger and fries, split crunchy salad and large plate of pork chops with arugula and lentils with another. Topped it off with chocolate custard with dark chocolate sauce and the B bomb which was a pastry, vanilla custard drenched with caramel sauce. Took another walk again after a satisfying dinner.

The prices are also a little high here, but you are in an expensive city. The menu is unique, and the food is good. I had fish tacos (which were a little small, and soggy). A nice walk up to Coit Tower after lunch, or near the Embarcadero and an easy walk to the Fishermen's Wharf area.

This is one of the best places in San Francisco to come with friends for conversation over a meal and drinks. The drinks are well made and the food is excellent and comforting, but with modern twists such as an unexpected, but delicious sprinkling of dried seaweed shreds on the French fries which are served with aioli as well. There are several small plates on the menu you'll want to share and a few larger main course options.

How do you give one star to a place where the food was actually pretty good? When the service is so bad that they beg for one star.We got to Fog City at 8:30 on a Friday night. First bad sign was that it was half full. (And even at half full it was deafeningly loud). Long story short (very long story) over a half hour to get water. About 45 minutes for drinks. Got drinks wrong. First courses came, then they came again. And once again. Then the waitress got mad at us. (Still not sure why -- we didn't want 3 first courses?). THEN we heard that they had run out of the entrees two of us had ordered (fried chicken). Another long wait and three of us got our entrees. Three of us finished our entrees. And then the fourth one (grilled trout came.To make up for the terrible service the restaurant gave us the tuna tartare appetizer after we were all done to make up for it.Food was pretty good.Not worth the service.And, it was maybe half full.Wonder why.

When you enter this establishment you are hit with the fantastic smell of wood fired stoves. Straight away, this place feels like home. I had the fortune of eating here three times last week. I was in San Francisco on business. This was one of my favourite restaurants we visited. The menu is small, but varied. The portion sizes are perfect, AND the FISH TACOS were extraordinary! Wow!

The restaurant has undergone a complete renovation since we last dined here. Very open space now. Gone are the brass plaques of the frequent diners, and some of the charm; but it has been replaced with clean lines and seemingly more Windows. Lunch for two with no drinks was $60 before tip. Service with a smile, and we were not rushed.

Sadly, your picture represents the best of Fog City Diner of the past. New look, new ownership, and sadly new standards for food. What is still called the Fog City burger at $17.50 is the same size as In-and-Out Burger, and without taste. It's a cool looking place, but doesn't compensate for the poor meal, and pathetic portion.

Met friends while overnighting on a cruise that stopped in SF. Fog City was convenient as it was across from the cruise terminal.Split the babaganoush appetizer for the table and friends had oysters. Mains consisted of 2 gnocchi, halibut, and duck. All serviceable, but nothing special; average size portions. Split one strawberry shortcake among the four of us. Drinks (2) were $12 apiece; wine was $10.25. All in all, nearly $250 tab for four with tip included for a rather non-memorable meal. Doubt we'd return even if the location is convenient.

We were searching for a place to eat a quick lunch and saw this spot on the iPhone Maps, information on the maps told us it was a fun little diner with movie history, and when we walked in the restaurant, that is not what we got. When we went, they must've recently remodeled because even the guy at the table next to us was asking the waitress questions about the previous restaurant and menu. It has an upscale kind of vibe and the hostess and waitress looked at us like we didn't belong. Like I said, we walked in thinking it was a diner. But we decided to give it a try, I ordered potato soup and my brother, a Caesar salad. The food was good, but I don't think I would come back. However, the Chef who brought out our meals was very nice and seemed to enjoy his job.

This is our go-to place when out of town friends are visiting. Food has been always good, service too. Very disappointing when we went this past weekend. Selections for entrees were limited and there were no specials. Got the halibut and while the fish was fresh and delicious, didn't care for the quinoa and sauce. The worst part of it was the service. The waiter barely tolerated our presence, was quite standoffish and condescending. It was embarrassing for us to be treated like that while with friends here from out of town, especially since we had built the place up to them. There was one very sweet female server who was friendly and fun- wish she had been working our table. Certainly not as good as it has been. Will find a new spot to take visitors for sure.

I visited the Fog City Diner a number of times when I worked in the S.F. Financial District years ago. We stopped in there last Sunday night and were greatly disappointed! The redecorated trying to make it more sophisticated but in doing so, in my opinion, they lost all the charm that the restaurant used to posses, such as the old dinner exterior with the chrome and neon sign. The waitresses were dressed in plaid shirts which seemed contradictory to the decor and the whole vibe of the place was unprofessional and dead. Granted, it was a Sunday night, but still...I could have overlooked all that if the food was good. We were under-inspired by the menu choices and settled for caesar salads and split a clam chowder, which should have been called bacon chowder.I would recommend skipping this place altogether.

The atmosphere is great and you see a broad selection of people from locals, business persons on a business trip to tourists. It is an easy place to find in the city and you can usually find parking in the area, not always the case in SF. Love the crab cakes,and just about anything on the menu. It is not your typical dinner.

I've had some really enjoyable dinners here over the years. It's nice to see the wood fires blazing as you walk in the door. Vast selection of drinks but we didn't partake. We sat in the middle of the floor and found it fairly noisy, but the tables are not jammed together so we could still talk (us older folks have a bit of trouble hearing in places where there are two many others talking at once).It's a good menu, but we found it hard to get portions right. My friend had a Caesar salad which was on the &quot;small but artful&quot; size. I had the mushrooms as an appetizer and it was a huge bowl and a great variety of delectable mushrooms; would have been great for two or three (it is sold as a side, not an appetizer). My friend had beef strips with shoestring potatoes (and Japanese spices) - the steak was excellent. I had St. Louis Ribs which came with slaw and I ordered a side of fries. Way too much food, especially after the mushrooms. I should have skipped the fries - there's a ton of slaw and it's nice, not the creepy creamy type, nicely vinegared. I was disappointed with the ribs because they were really slathered with sauce that completely over powered the flavor of the meat.I left a bunch of fries and slaw - it was just too much for me and I am a big eater!

Returning from the Alcatraz ferry we wanted somewhere close for lunch. We came across this with our trusty TripAdvisor offline guide ( a heaven sent when you don't want overseas roaming and can download a city guide for out and about). My husband was craving a clam chowder as it was a bit chilly out on the rock but the standard menu didn't offer it but were tempted by the good reviews and burger/ sandwiches. However much to my husbands delight they had clam chowder as a special so he ordered that and I wasn't super hungry so was happy with half a crispy fried chicken sandwich. It was more like a burger but nice anyway, coming with baby potatoes and pickles. A very hearty meal conveniently located within walking distance of the Alcatraz ferry. Worth a trip if you are in the area and hungry.

Lunch time dining here produces a varied menu of interesting choices. Marketing is everything, so an albacore melt replaces a tuna melt and adds $5 to the tab, but the resulting food is presented much more elegantly and tastes much better than your average tuna melt. Indeed the food is the high point here.Busy place, so book before arriving and request a booth, where the noise level may be a bit lower. If you're dining at a regular table and are over 25, bring someone with you whose conversation is predictable, because you won't be able to hear them.

We haven't returned here since the remodel. We used to come to Fog City every Christmas Eve for lunch or dinner until a few years ago. We decided to re-start our tradition and so had Christmas Eve dinner again this year.It is unfortunate, but we were a bit disappointed this time. I had the Jerk Chicken. The only thing I could taste was cumin. Pure cumin. Nothing else! It was too much...way too much! My husband ordered the hamburger. His wasn't bad. He just wasn't impressed. And for the price we paid, we expected a bit more on the food quality/taste side of things.Sadly, we have decided that we need a new Christmas Eve dining tradition/venue.Please don't misunderstand...it's not that the food was horrible. It just wasn't anything near what it used to be. And my chicken dish was just way too heavily spiced!

After an all day walking tour through SFO we were very hungry and choose the closest restaurant on our way back to the hotel. It was a very nice coincidence and it surprised us totally. Everything was cooked after ordering, no pre-cooked meals you usually get elsewhere. Luckily there were only two seats left at the kitchen bar and it shows it was the right place for good food, new experience, good conversations and a chef who knows how to treat and serve customer. First he asked if we have any questions about the menu, after ordering he explained to us how the food was prepared and flavoured and even he was extremely busy, he always had time to inform you about the restaurant and how it works. Also the cocktails were great, shaken by hand and not from and automate. We enjoyed so much that we went back on our third day for the second time and have been surprised again as the chef remembered us and told us exactly what we had for dinner 2 days ago. Very impressive. But also our server was great, she was attentive and very kind with everything.The bar is very well equipped with drinks from around the world. I had a westfalia beer with my ribs and a calvados after for dessert, which was delicious. It made our long weekend trip, which was not short of highlights even more successful.

Waitstaff was attentive and pleasant. Can't go wrong with this San Francisco staple.

We had just left the Exploratorium and had a hungry college kid and a hungry middle school kid to feed for lunch. Fog City has been a place to go over the years, and since I hadn't been for some time, we decided to give it a go. Our waiter was great, and the food was very good. It was a little over priced, but the overall experience was great.If you go, do yourself a favor and try the homemade custard. Even if you aren't a real dessert person, give it a try. With it they have three options of topping sauces. One of them is a homemade warm caramel sauce. Every single one of us who tasted it, sighed with delight at how good it is! Seriously good stuff.

Planned on going to Coqueta for a late lunch but they were closed already. Walked down the street and stumbled in to Fog City. (Luckily) Had 7 people for a late lunch. Prompt service. Good cocktails. Food was terrific. I suggest the fried chicken sandwich but everyone at the table had something different and they all said it was good.

The original Fog City Diner was one of our go-to places while visiting San Francisco for quite a while, but recently had my first experience since it was updated a few years ago and it was a change for the good. Much more modern and open atmosphere and menu. I dined alone at the bar and service was great as well as the atmosphere. The menu has been updated and the food was excellent. Would recommend to anyone who liked the &quot;old&quot; Fog City Diner and first timers as well.

Good food, pleasant atmosphere, great location convenient to everything waterfront. Stuck with the malady of the original Fog City being an icon in minds of their old customers - so the new version isn't &quot;worthy&quot;. Too bad because the new version is really as good as/better than the original to me/friends. Their bar is far better. A great evening is hanging in bar for wine/drinks/appies.

Fog City has a wonderfully relaxing and comfortable atmosphere, great service and a brunch that's delicious. I had the frittata and the biscuits with warm fruit compote. It turned out to be more than I could eat but the biscuit was too good to leave behind. Do the boxed it and next day from the toaster it was equally fabulous! The Benedict was also happily consumed at our table by a normally Benedict-snob who pronounced it heavenly with crab and perfect hollandaise. Our resident sweet-tooth went with the brioche French toast and allowed the rest of us a &quot;sample&quot; morsel. Next time, I'll endulge and have it as well with their famous bacon. Our waiter was helpful, engaging and just he right combination of diligent and restrained to make it a perfect meal and friend gathering,

I always remembered the old neon sign for Fog City Diner along the Embarcadero but usually avoid diners, apparently to my benefit as the last couple of decades seemed to fade for the old establishment (according to some), until its recent renovation last year. Anyways, a couple of days ago an aunt and uncle happened to be docked at pier 27 on a cruise, right across the street, and the night we were to meet up was sadly a Monday, when so many great places in North Beach are closed. My original plan of great Italian food being crushed, I quickly arranged for us to meet at Fog City- kind of on the fence about going there in the first place. So so many of the places along the water are overpriced and silly, since their draw on the tourist crowd makes it so. But, we went, and it was quite nice, really, besides the bill at the end. We got 4 oyster shooters, $3.50 a piece if I remember right (they were delicious). Fresh, great house-made condiments. We split our dinners, rightfully so since the portions are pretty big. My husband and I split the burger, which was tasty and juicy and just the right amount to split. Our toddler son had chicken tenders and fries, which for some reason was like ten bucks or something, which I think is crazy for kids food. Aunt and uncle had the jerk chicken and a salad, which was huge and they enjoyed. I had two domestic beers and my aunt had two rather expensive gin cocktails, which then pushed the bill over the edge (haha). With two people not drinking at all, and both couples sharing their dinners, plus one kids meal, we went well over $120. We enjoyed our food, and I'm sure they do a very good business being right on the Embarcadero, but as a local, I can't say that I'll be rushing back. They at least need to give customers a break by having a few more affordable local beer options and some reasonably priced kids food, for those idiots like me who thought we were going to something a little more casual ;) But they know they can get away with it, and they probably will.

We had a large group (25) and with advance notice, Greg, the GM made a special concession to provide a special menu of the best of appetizers and a variety of main course options to satisfy the diverse crowd. Well done and we'll be back again, and again.

The concierge at our hotel (Vitale) made this recommendation and we have to agree, the buzz among the locals is very correct. This is a very comfortable chic-diner/diner-chic with a very interesting menu ... something for everyone. We had five selections from the menu and each was exceptional - then desert to top it off. Bubbles for the start and panna cotta to finish.

Unfortunately we'd had a rather big lunch so we did not actually have dinner here but decided to make it a tapas experience sitting at the bar. Appetizers were very generous portions and each was delicious; the kale salad with pepitas was excellent, so was the ahi tuna stickers, and the brocolini with garlic chips and garum was exceptional. Cocktails and wine list were also very good. Great atmosphere in a nicely appointed setting, highly recommend a visit.

Went there with about 8 colleagues and we got a large booth that could've seated 3 or 4 more. The place had a nice smell from wood burning oven somewhere. Service was very good with a waiter who was having a great day. We had several appetizers such as octopus which was chewy but delicious, an interesting take on deviled eggs with bacon and short rib tacos. Dinners came out and everyone was pleased. I ordered the shrimp and grits and it wasn't anything like the southern favorite might be thinking of. So I just rolled with It: It had grits on one side and a vegetable broth on the other, carrots and large shrimp with the tails on. Weird but tasty. I think the operative word at this restaurant was delicious but expensive.

Stopped in for lunch before an Alcatraz tour, because it was convenient. Deviled egg appetizer is very good, but $9 for 4 eggs? Come on. I had the fried chicken sandwich, and my wife the tuna salad melt. We both thought they were okay. It's a nice clean place, with a good location. Not a bad choice if you don't know where to go and just want something close to pier 33.

We had a good time and I can't wait to go back next time I'm there. We were not super hungry so we ate light. Next time I am going to try the delicious brick oven fired pizza.

Like visiting an old friend, I have been making a point to visit The Fog every time I am in San franscisco. If you like things to stay the same, the Fog could be a disipointment. They incorporate &quot;what's hot&quot; in dinning, with a bit of Fog flair. Things seem to always be a bit different. This is not cutting edge culinary; just a dash of current trends. Well prepaired drinks at a very friendly bar, good service (but certainly not fast food) with fresh fair prepaired in interesting (not too funky) ways in a restaurant with great atmosphere and a beautiful view ... especially when the fog comes rolling in. There is no better excuse to order dessert and another drink ... waiting for the fog to clear ...

Overpriced Crap Cakes

My girlfriend and I mainly came here because we saw the place on the travel channel and they raved about the crab cakes. So that was the main reason why we went there. We ordered the crab cakes right off the bat for an appetizer, then a bowl of their soup and a cubano sandwich to split. Perhaps it was the travel channel that hyped up the crab cakes but when they came out there were two total crab cakes that were the size of a sand dollar. They also disappointed me in taste, there was very little meat compared to the breading. I expected more from the travel channel review and the price of $18 for two little crab cakes. Other than that the rest of the food was great and the service was great.

I know this place gets great reviews but I just did not like it. The service was good but the food (why do we go to a restaurant?) was just not that impressive. And for the price, REALLY not that impressive.Falafel was served on white bread 'roll' that was 'toasted' - dried out would be a better word. Falafel can be a little dry sometimes so when you put it with the dried out white bread it is just bad!The 'eggplant dip' served with pita bread was good but a very small portion for the price.Fact is, it was close to the symphony outdoor performance and the only thing open - or we would never gone their in the first place. I do not recommend this restaurant - average to poor quality food and way over priced for what you get.The nice wait staff was the only positive thing in Fog City.

If you are going, the Hamburger is really good; served with homemade cheese.

This place was requested by a local relative when I offered to take her and friends out for dinner. The menu is not extensive but everything that we ordered was very well executed.

The decor is a take-off on the former diner (or so we read), but this is really a trendy restaurant. Wine list was limited, no European offerings at all, but there was a nice Armagnac to have at the end of the meal.

They came with kurikake and aioli dip, and so that made them a little better, but they didn't give much dip. So basically, I got a burger and fries, a soda and with tip, I walked out $35 poorer.

The broccoli was amazing. It was a good sized portion of long stemmed broccoli, with a mildly spicy, oily flavor. On top of the dish where thin toasted slivers of garlic. &quot;Best broccoli I've ever eaten,&quot; said the bartender, and I concur.The crab cakes were just ok. Honestly I expected a bit better for seafood in this locale.

Unlike many iconic restaurants, the food in Fog City Diner is wonderful! And the view is wonderful (if it's not a foggy day). Portions are small - perfect size. And unlike fancy restaurants that serve their food on sterile-looking white plates, the plates are rustic looking and add to the appeal. Their ice cream (frozen custard) is a must. Save room! I accidentally ordered the caramel sauce for the ice cream and it was wonderful beyond words. Reservations highly recommended.

This place looks small from the outside but it sure packs a punch! We went for a light lunch before our flight and everything was so good! Definitely try the fries!!!!! And the bloody Mary's are amazing! The deviled egg is such a good addition! We hope to return for dinner soon!!

Awful service, tiny portions, overpriced food. Had to wait 2.5 hours for food, continuously asking for bread (received at 2-hour mark). When asked for food to-go, rude staff cancelled half our orders.

First, the bad: my group of 8, WITH a reservation, still waited over an hour for a table. Now the good: they were extremely gracious, offering us multiple appetizers &quot;on the house&quot; including fries, brussel sprouts, deviled eggs, calamari, and tacos. Everything was very tasty. I had the short ribs... tender and seasoned perfectly. Others in my group had steak, chicken and pasta. Everything was delicious. Can't comment on price, since someone in the group picked up the tab. It was a pretty cool looking place... probably a good date scene.

More misses than hits in this formula-concept restaurant

First, a tip of the hat to an attractive space that show-cases one of the most brilliant bars I've ever bellied-up to. It's a deep-vee shape (think NYC's Flatiron Bldg) with onyx top that seats close to 40 people.Cocktails ($12-$14) are tasty, but if you look closely, they are pre-made in batches. I know, it shouldn't effect the flavor, but it allows them to be robotically prepared by indifferent bartenders - it's a cost saving mechanism that saps the soul from a bar experience. Let's face it - do you really go to a bar because they have a different flavor of bottled cocktail mix than you can buy off the shelf at BevMo?And then there's the food. App's are generally in the $10-$12 range with adequate portion sizes. Roasted Beets with Goat Cheese sauce was fine, but the Goat Cheese sauce was not much more flavorful than a Bechemel. Short Rib tacos are simply flopped on a plate and under-seasoned. Not bad, just unremarkable.Biggest miss was the Braised Beef Cheek with Duck Fat Potatoes ($24 - one of the least expensive entrees, most of which were in the $30+ range). The Cheek was kind of shredded, sort of not, and just deposited as a small pile of protein on the plate. Reminded me of a pulled-pork that had been scooped out of a steam table tray with an ice cream scoop. Interesting, but lacked depth of flavor and (yet again), lacked seasoning. The Duck Fat Potatoes were a tragedy. One of the very few high points of indigenous British cooking are the Sunday dinners with a joint of protein and oven roasted potatoes that are painstakingly basted with hot grease (laced with duck fat at better restaurants) to create a sumptuous potato with a golden brown crust enclosure to a fluffy baked-potato center. Fog City's version was a boiled potato (which makes a fluffy center impossible), with a vaguely roasted exterior - no hint of basting. Yet another example of short-cuts in execution.By far the star of the evening was the Mac &amp; Cheese ($11). Great flavors with a well-browned top-crust; and large chunks of smoked ham. One of the better M&amp;C renditions I've had.Overall, the owners of this new version of Fog City are numbers-guys (or gals). They have a concept, they have invested in time-saving short cuts, and the end product shows. It's not bad, it's just unremarkable and feels antiseptic. Il Forneio and Hillstone are both nearby and are better examples of well executed formula-concept restaurants. With exception of the aforementioned deep-vee bar, there is little reason to return.

We always come here to eat when we visit San Francisco. The restaurant has a great atmosphere, the food is always a treat, and the staff are really nice. I see other people have commented that service is a wee bit slow, which I would agree with, but we come here to relax and enjoy our dinner, so why the rush? I highly recommend the Wagyu flank steak frites. I know I should comment on how great the steak was (it was cooked to perfection), but I have to say the shoestring fries they serve with it are just brilliant- really salty and moreish. Try the panna cotta pudding cake for dessert - what a finish to a fantastic meal.

Went for dinner at the start of restaurant week. We did not eat from the prix-fixe menu, we chose some other items we heard were great.Had a reservation, arrived on time and waited maybe 5 minutes for our table. Not too bad. Waited longer than usual for someone to bring water or take drink orders. They have a nice wine, beer, and mixed drink menu.Good views out to the Bay Bridge and a busy neighborhood. Nice atmosphere (this is more than a diner) but very loud when busy. Open kitchen so you can see food prep.Had the deviled eggs to start, Fog City burger and pork chop for mains. All were very good and this was more than enough food for two. No room for dessert.This is a great place for hearty comfort food done in a much more upscale way than your typical diner. Relatively high prices but this is a popular area in an expensive city. I believe you are getting what you pay for. Will go back for brunch some time.

Food took about the same again. Hmmmm. And the children sitting at the bar? Whats that about?

Family of four (two teens) ate here after our Alcatraz tour and were very pleased. It's a few blocks away from the pier which is nice so the place does not feel touristy. Food and service was very good, interesting menu, place has a nice modern decor and vibe to it. Definitely check it out if you are looking for something other than the junk they serve at the piers.

Same location, still great food, and a nice change to the seating - now there are two &quot;common&quot; tables between the booths at the windows and the kitchen/bar area, so if you don't have a reservation you can still get a seat and possibly meet some interesting people. We opted for small plates instead of a regular dinner, the fries and the brussels sprouts were wonderful, the oysters excellent, and the coffee granita was amazing. I will definitely keep coming back, no matter what name!

Wife and I had lunch here with our 12-year old grandson after an Alcatraz trip. The diner is pretty hard to see across the main waterfront street, but we were very pleased with lunch. I had salmon smorrebord, which was excellent, and wife had ahi tuna and was very pleased. Grandson's cheeseburger, alas, turned out to be nothing special. Fairly pricey for a diner, but highly recommended as a place to take a break along the waterfront.

Stumbled on Fog City while walking in San Fran one evening. Set back on the Embarcadero its a classy cool styled diner.Inside its light and airy with a nice space around the tables. there is also bar seating.The menu isn't huge but still has plenty of choice and the smell of the wood burner is a great temptation. Service is prompt and attentive.The calamari starter is superb and was followed by wood smoked clams and pork chop mains. All the food we had was well presented and perfectly cooked. Save room for the frozen custard which is a delight.Quality local/micro brews and coctails complete the picture for this well above average restaurant

If memory serves, Fog City Diner once was the subject of a &quot;They don't take the American Express card&quot; television commercial. If so, that policy has changed because mine was accepted.I gather, from another reviewer, so have the building and the menu changed. I know nothing about that, because this lunch was my only time here. I liked it a lot.Not crowded at 11:30 on a Saturday in October. Four small plates were plenty for two - crab cakes (very good); deviled eggs with crispy quinoa and bacon (very very good); golden and red beets in goat cheese dressing (excellent), and; brussels sprouts, quartered and sauteed with pear cubes (outstanding).Eighteen wines available by-the-glass. A sort of take charge waiter, but with good judgment. Memorable all in all. I'll return someday.

Found this little diner by accident. We couldn't find the place we were looking for so stopped in this diner. Four women looking for a nice meal before heading back to Ohio. We decided to sit at the end of the counter where we could watch the sous chef. The evening manager explained the menu and all about the restaurant. Everything is very fresh and absolutely delicious. The chef answered our questions as she prepared steaks, lamb, salmon and a wide variety of side dishes. It was a wonderful dining experience and the perfect ending to a girl's trip to wine country.

Years ago this was a favorite spot. After a bad spell, Fog City is back. Food is super tasty and creative. The small and large plates are fun to share and portions generous. We particularly enjoyed the Deviled Eggs, Broccoli, and heavenly Brussel Sprouts. The French Fries were special as was the Mac and Cheese. Fish and ribs were cooked perfectly and served hot...really important to me. Next time I will have the Roast Chicken!The only reason I reserved 1 star was because service was slow; even though our waiter was knowledgeable and nice. It also was way too noisy for me but I realize this may be an age related issue.

While visiting San Francisco, we made sure to once again dine at the Fog City Diner. We were not disappointed. The service is excellent, and just as the last time, our server described a special of the night so well, we strayed from our original menu choices. He also paired the wines very well. When our meal was devoured, we left full and more than satisfied. Thanks again Fog City!!

We have been going here for years and always have a good experience. The recent remodel is very nice but our favorite is sitting on the sidewalk terrace on a sunny afternoon - the sun hits in just the right gentle angle and it's a quite street off the busy Embarcadero, so there is always plenty to see. The food is very good, healthy, creative, tasty - perhaps not the finest in SF but certainly &quot;very good&quot; and the ambiance, location, wine/cocktail list and excellent service make this one of our go to places. Enjoy!

We returned all excited for our first experience of the &quot;New&quot; Fog City. So very disappointed. Service was good, reservation prompt, and ambiance SO different. All the old &quot;comfort diner food&quot; is gone and now it all seems a bit too &quot;trendy&quot; and &quot;current&quot;. Helpings are HUGE. The green salad and whole chicken are MORE than enough for two. Pork chop was AWESOME! A simple &quot;Lemon Drop with Grey Goose&quot; was the worst I have EVER had, anywhere. Undrinkable (but I managed). We brought our own wine and paid a corkage and just had the one cocktail and it was still $200+ for 3 with no desert/coffee/extras...... Waiter tried to push &quot;let me choose your deserts&quot; but we passed. VERY loud and boisterous bar scene, which makes dining experience awkward, as the bar is down the entire middle of the restaurant. Feels like eating at a bar, instead of a restaurant WITH a bar. We left sad and disappointed. Perhaps us &quot;old regulars&quot; (we have gone for MANY years) are NOT the crowd that is being thought of or catered to. Such is progress in the Big City......

This was one of the best meals we had in our whole three week American trip.We were seated on bar stalls at a tall narrow table, and had a brilliant view through the panoramic glass windows all round the restaurant of bustling city life.I had chicken sesame salad with candied peanuts, husband had calamari, one daughter had crabcakes with basil aioli and the other had a fried chicken sandwich with nothing else in it. We also ordered a plate of grilled peppers to share and had great fun trying to make sure Dad got the hot ones, though none of them were mouth-blasting. Then for pudding I had frozen vanilla custard with egg yolk caramel sauce, husband had chocolate panacotta, and the girls shared two chocolate and orange doughnuts.Our waiter was glamorous and friendly - we had lots of fun trying to say 'to-may-to' and -to-mah-to' in each others accents, and all in all it was expensive but very worth it.

What a great place to eat in a town that is full of great places to eat! I started out with their famous Milk Punch cocktail which blends brandy, rum, with lemon and spices and some clarified milk. I normally do not order drinks like that from the menu being a straight Titos/soda kind of guy but that one sounded interesting. Glad I did because it was really done well.Crab cakes were fantastic as expected and the pork chop was very good. Nothing to special there but it was nicely prepared and hit the spot. My favorite course had to be the french onion soup, MAN WAS THAT GOOD. I eat that dish a lot and it was one of the best I have ever had.Great atmosphere and the service was very good as well. A little loud so be aware of that but nothing at all that would keep me from returning. All in all this was a terrific experience.

For my meal, I ordered two appetizers - the crabcake with pesto aioli and a beet salad paired with a glass of Grenache. Everything was perfectly prepared and the combination of flavors superb. My husband thoroughly enjoyed the Wild Boar Spare Ribs, and my 7year-old daughter ate a gigantic cheeseburger. Can't wait to eat there again when and if we ever return to San Francisco!

I'm a recent transplant to San Francisco, and have been vaguely aware of FCD for awhile. But somehow I got the idea it was a diner. Dropped in for dinner on the way to the movies at the Embarcadero Centre; it's not a diner, but is more in the American bistro format. Food was average, but I would give them high marks for a friendly staff who are ready to pour a large selection of fun cocktails. I would go early as the place appears to pack out.

Fell upon this as we were searching for food and had walked most of Embarcadero unsuccessfully looking in at Pier 7 or 9 for something we liked the look of.The welcome was good and the menu looked appealing. There was a good selection of beers and the cheese biscuits with rosemary were really tasty.The menu seems to show that the chef is really concerned with the origin and quality of the ingredients - also that they are willing to go a bit left field - the fries with bonito flakes and furikake was a tasty novelty. Artichokes with aioli were pretty damn good. The burger was memorable if a tiny bit expensive. Finished with a delicious cruller with caramel sauce and frozen custard.I'd go back at a moments notice if only there wasn't an 11h flight involved.

I've been wanting to try this restaurant ever since seeing it in an American Express TV ad campaign years ago. Friends who had been to San Francisco also recommended it, and I finally had the opportunity about a week ago. I had already been to a couple of the typical tourist-type restaurants on the wharf, so I was pleasantly surprised by the location, atmosphere and food at the Fog City Diner. It is (mercifully) located at the corner of Embarcadero and Battery, away from the heavy tourist crowds at the west end of the wharf. The restaurant has had a recent facelift, and is more in keeping with the upscale and cutting-edge menu. I tried the famous hamburger, and my wife had the ribeye. Both were terrific: properly seasoned and prepared. The staff was very friendly, and even called a cab for us when we were leaving. I would definitely recommend this restaurant.

Although my first experience was not good, I would give it another shot. My burger was prepared incorrectly and very rare, the cost was almost $20 for burger/fries/water. The bartender and the cook seemed visibly bothered that I needed to return my food.The food finally returned after my colleague was completely done with his lunch. The second time around, the burger came out much more well done than I like but it was getting late and I was hungry at that point.The place looks great, the bar design is unique and I know that my colleague enjoyed his meal and for that reason, I'd try Fog City again if I'm in that area.

We had dinner with ny fiancee here on a Sunday afternoon. Conviniently located if you are out for a stroll on Embarcadero. Food was delicious but we found the portion sizes to small and we stayed hungry. We both are small people. It's ok if you want a drink and a snack but not good for dinner.

I've seen many reviews of Fog City Diner referencing the word &quot;touristy.&quot; Well, we were spending the night in San Francisco while on a cruise and decided to try a local eatery for dinner. This was amazing! We were able to walk to it from our ship, the dress code was casual and the service was excellent! When we arrived around 7:30pm, it was noisy (good, vibrant noisy, not overwhelmingly noisy) with locals enjoying drinks after work at the bar area. We were seated without a wait at a table inside. You can dine outside also, but we thought it was too warm. The diner is open on 2 sides to the outside, so cool air conditioning on the inside wasn't blasting, but it was tolerable. Our waiter helped us make our dinner choices with wonderful recommendations. We dined on several appetizers along with the flame grilled garlic shrimp and the wood oven clams. OMG, outrageous flavors and freshness and textures! The portions weren't large, but enough to be able to taste everything we wanted to and really enjoy it! We're glad we had just enough room left to try the frozen custard dessert with an array of sauces. This was a restaurant you take memories, not doggie bags, home with you!

One might be put off by Fog City Diner's touristy location across from the pier, but the quality of the food and freshness of the food are actually very good. The menu had many seasonal items, and I thought all of the dishes at our table tasted wonderful. Service is good, the restaurant and facilities are clean, great views and people watching, with fresh, seasonal dishes that will not disappoint. Don't let the touristy location scare you into thinking this will be bad, poorly executed food -- it is well thought-out, and quite good.

$17. burger / 2 dollar turd

$17. hamburger review . . .You would expect a patty larger than 1/4 lb. and gee, you might even expect it to be cooked the way you asked for it. When the waiter asked how it was I said that it was overcooked. He explained that it was a burger that was &quot;a tribute&quot; to fast food burgers. No apology. This burger was a tribute to a turd.I don't know about the rest of the menu but I would steer clear of this item.I have a feeling this version of Fog City doesn't hold a candle to the exceptional quality of the former Fog City Diner of the 80's and 90's. That place was great !

Change Can Be Good
Rating: 4

Be forewarned, the &quot;new&quot; Fog City is not the Fog City Diner of old and generally that's good news. Remodeling opened up the interior, providing more window tables, a much-needed expanded bar, and a welcome overall face lift. The menu has dramatically changed and is more creative. Typical of the &quot;new&quot; Fog City lunch is an excellent open-faced smoked salmon sandwich with egg salad on rye, nicely garnished with fresh radish and fennel. Crisply roasted Brussels sprouts with pear, which was very tasty, has replaced the mac &amp; cheese. Dinner is predominantly a smaller plates/tapas menu with dishes meant to be shared. The menu, like the diner, has been given a needed face-lift, but the food is not perfect. Today, the Sunday brunch ham hash was served with undercooked eggs. The wait staff isn't particularly attentive, which appears to be a short-staffing issue, but they are very pleasant. This is a solid but not incredible restaurant. The prices are reasonable and not San Francisco over-priced. We will return, knowing this is a good casual dining site.

Our experience was of confused staff and very odd dishes. They didn't know if they were serving dinner or lunch, and the staff weren't communicating with one another so our order was wrong. None of the ambiance of the former diner is intact. My dish was a mess of soggy bread, deli turkey and sloshy cheese sauce. It was really revolting. Very disappointed.

Bring the real Fog City Diner back!!!

We went here for a valentines meal whilst on honeymoon in the city. We hadn't booked do were pleasantly surprised that they managed to squeeze us in. To start with we had a bread, can't remember which one but it was cooked in the wooden stove. Then we had the mushrooms in a paprika stew - yummy. Closely followed by a pork dish and a duck leg dish. Pudding was a frozen custard with a caramel sauce and my husband chose the apple pie with chilli. I supped cocktails throughout the evening whilst husband had wine. The service was very attentive , the food delicious and we loved the open kitchen with the wooden stoves. Also loved the way the food was served, in dribs and drabs and very informal. Fabulous!

The menu appears a tad fancy, but it's not. Just great, fresh and tasty food. Some plates are designed for sharing and it's a great way to try out the menu.The highlight, especially if you're a dessert fan, is the Chocolate pannacotta cake- oh my it's good! You probably won't want to share it with anyone!If you want a table then you will need to book as it seems to be packed every night, although eating at the bar was just as much fun.Think neighbourhood bar and bistro- not pretentious, just fun!

Our first experience (and it won't be our last) was the best. Came to celebrate my Husbands Daughters' Birthday and the food was out of this world. We had the Cauliflower Nugges, Brussel Sprouts, Deviled Eggs, Furikake Fries, Kale Salad, County Line Chicories, Wood Oven Whole Chicken, Berkshire Pork Cheeks, Oven Roasted Carrots, B Bomb, Frozen Custard, and the French Crullers. Even if you order just 3 appetizersand an entree, its plenty for 2 people. We will definitely be going back the next time we are in the City.

Chef-owner Bruce Hill has five restaurants in the Bay Area. Each is unique, each memorable. Fog City is his newest, redesigning an iconic SF spot. The decor is model and beautiful , comfortable. and classy. The blazing brick oven fire contribute so the atmosphere as well as the tastes. The wrap around bar is crafted from stunning wood; the specialty drinks, exciting. But you visit Bruce's restaurants for his creative cooking---and Fog City exceeds expectations. The &quot;snacks&quot; were amazing, especially the deviled quail eggs and the Brussels sprouts--who knew. We had four snacks, a fabulous salad as an intermezzo, two terrific entrees--the wood-fired swordfish and the wood-fired boned whole chicken--and the most amazing carrots. Save room for the curlers for dessert,

In spite of some previous reviews, we found the Fog City to be welcoming, with an extensive menu of eclectic dishes at reasonable prices (for San Francisco). The &quot;shared plates&quot; were excellent for our party of 4; we had a variety of fish, vegetarian and meat dishes; all very fresh and flavorful. Favorites included the roasted brussel sprouts and salmon carpaccio. Our server was efficient, knowledgeable about the wine list and very friendly. This is NOT your mother's diner! Great place, and great location; we took a nice walk along the Embarcadero after our meal.

While it's truly a shame that the chrome diner look on the exterior has been replaced with a drab, false brick face, the interior has had a welcomed overhaul. Overall, prices are perhaps a tad on the high side. But there are plenty of tasty selections, as well as some reasonably priced wine selections, that make this place worth a visit. Succulent and juicy, the roast chicken not to be missed.

Yes, the menu is a bit limited, and it is a little pricy, as other reviewers have noted, but it also offers some rather creative cuisine. We enjoyed the food very much, and the service was good, even though it was during lunch and crowded. I liked the diner layout, and it seemed to carry over the feel of an earlier era. Just be prepared that it will cost a bit more than you might expect, if you've been lunching around town.

Really cool joint right across from the Embarcadero. Old school diner layout and feel which is a nice touch.

The restaurant itself is kind of tiny but I still feel like it would be good for large groups. Will probably try again next time we are in the city.

Visited in Oct 13, after walking past in evenings and it seeming busy. decided to see for myself and was not disappointed. The interior is great, smart but informal, with a great atmosphere. The staff are extremely welcoming and warm and took time to talk through the menu and ingredients. The menu is interesting and uses fresh, good quality local ingredients. We ordered a main each which you will need to order a side with - the burger as an example comes on its own and then you can choose to order a selection of veg or chips, but each dish is outstanding, despite being a slightly unusual way of ordering. Def worth a visit, great service and very tasty fresh and imaginative food.

Went here right after it reopened as FOG CITY and I have to say I was disappointed. The place is attractive in it's design, but the noise level is almost unbearable. The menu was explained to our table as being small plates to share, but we found almost everything we ordered not very easy to share. The duck we ordered was extremely expensive ($26) for one duck leg. How are three people supposed to share that? I think our server was lacking in her knowledge of the menu. We were never given any serving utensils with our small plates or much attentiveness. Other tables with different servers seemed to be getting much better treatment.This was by far the most expensive and the worst meal I had on my visit to San Francisco.

Outwardly, this would seem to be a typical throwback American diner, but the menu hints at something more special. The quality keeps up on the menu's promise, too. I sampled all 7 items my family and I ordered, and every one was superb. The clam chowder was the 2nd best I've ever had, only BARELY exceeded by the Yacht Club in Silverdale WA. Wish I had a larger family so that I could've ordered a few more things! Portions were not large for the price, but this place is not about volume, it's about quality. Charming waitress GiGi was the icing on the cake! To be honest, this meal was more creative and far tastier than our dinner at Roy's two days earlier, which was almost twice the cost.

Robert C., our server, was great...offering suggestions and checking back. The atmosphere is really classy too, but you can wear jeans and feel at home.

Pretty close to pier 39 is the Fog City Diner .... not the 50's diner style on the inside but the outside has that great shiny look.Inside it looks more an uptide restaurant, but the staff is very nice and helpfull, price wise is not bad either, the food is great and there is a lot to choose from ......

This place has such a cool atmosphere of a great old diner. The service is great and the food is deliecious. I had an order of sweet potato fries and then a butter lettuce salad with candied nuts and cheese. I loved it and Ill be back again as always.

Met friends from the Bay Area for dinner on a Friday night. They made reservations. Table was ready when we arrived. They call this a 'Diner,' but don't go there expecting the huge menu and bland food found in your typical east coast diner. The menu was eclectic, the wine list was first class, the food was spectacular!!! The only thing which resembled a classical diner was the prices--very reasonable in my opinion.The only downside to the evening was the view. Normally there would be a view of the San Francisco Bay and the Ferry traffic to and from Marin County. Currently, there is a view of major construction underway to prepare for the next America's Cup. Oh well, the cost of dining in paradise...

I went here because of the comedy 'So I Married an Axe Murderer'. I expected diner food but it was much more than that. Lunch was excellent (Pear salad, and I'm not a pear fan but it was excellent!!) , so came back a few days later for Supper (snittzel I think it was - and very tastey) Easy to get to, with the F Street Car, get off at Greenwich (I think)

Not your average diner experience. I actually didn't know what to expect a friend suggested we go there and all I knew was that the diner was in &quot;So I Married an Axe Murderer&quot; but it was so good. Best onion rings ever, served with homemade spicy ketchup. Mostly tapas style food and drinks named after old school famous folks; I had a Marilyn Monroe, it was excellent.

Terrific view of the ships sliding by in the evening light, a fabulous staff who graciously made suggestions, which were fantastic ~ from the small plates, to the desserts ~ and all this for a very reasonable price in San Francisco. Who would have thought that something with 'Diner' in the name could be such a delight. We loved this place!

We spotted this restaurant on our way back to our hotel after a day on the pier. I hadn't heard anything about it. We stopped for dinner the next evening around 5 PM as we had hungry kids with us. It wasn't busy and parking was available on the street in in front of the diner. The diner itself is fantastic, small inside but right out of the '40's or '50's. The service was top notch, our server was very quick. Our food was extremely fast coming to us once we ordered. It was all delicious. Our kids ordered milkshakes (their specialty) and they both said it was the best they ever had! I would definitely recommend anyone trying Fog City Diner!

This restaurant was recommended by the guide on the bus tour and we would certainly pass it on to others. We had not booked but this was not a problem and were even given seats in the window. The menu contained a very good choice of meals. We opted for the Chicken Schnitzel with Garlic Mash. It was delicious. We followed up with yummy Strawberry Cheesecake and delicious Butterscotch Creme Brulee. And all of this for a price comparable with prices for similar in the UK. Very pleasant and helpful staff. The only downside was the couple sitting at the table next to us - they clearly wanted everyone to hear their conversation.

We stopped at the Fog City Diner after our trip to Alcatraz Island as it right on The Embarcedero and on the way back to our hotel just off Market street.The menu was electic with down home comfort food with a city slicker twist. I had the chicken tacos - delish!!! The sourdough bread was to die for.Service however was lacking...our waiter was rude and ignored us pretty much the whole time we were there. Thank goodness for the &quot;bus boys&quot; as they were fantastic and on top of things.All in if you want some good eats stop by. I'm sure the other waiters/waiteresses were lovely. We did see some people being very attentive to their tables.

Fog City Diner is easy to get to, as it is right under the Coit Tower and a few feet from the Embarcadero and Greenwich stop on the F Line. The setting is a traditional dining car layout, but with a full bar and creative menu. We had a great shrimp cocktail, a tasty Anchor Steam Fish and Chips, and wonderful steamed pork buns. Dessert was a great strawberry malted. The service was attentive it has a great view of the piers, and we had a great evening out!

We ate here before our night tour to Alcatraz. I had the shrimp and grits, my husband had the crab cakes and my son had the pork buns. The shrimp and grits were very good, thought not the best I have ever had. The crab cakes were small, 3 on the plate with no sides. They were good though. My son also liked his pork buns. The chocolate lava cake was the best. The service was very good and the diner was beautiful. Would definitely recommend this place. Worth the walk.

Ten of us showed up here after the lunch crowd and before the dinner crowd on a Wed afternoon. We had no problems getting a table. I've been to the Fog City Diner numerous times in the past 20 or so years and once again, I have NOT been disappointed. The atmosphere is classic, the service professional and friendly, and the food AWESOME!There is a fully stocked bar and a decent wine list. The menu includes salads, sandwiches, vegetable dishes, seafood, meats, burgers, desserts, and their &quot;classic&quot; dishes which includes San Francisco's signature seafood dish Cioppino (sorry, all the other cities that claim it as their own is sooooo wrong, it is a true San Francisco dish and so far I have not found a decent place outside of SF that can make a good one). The menu is an eclectic blend of all that is San Francisco. One should not have any problems finding a menu item that they cannot order here. Finally, there is table dining, counter dining, and outside dining.If you are expecting &quot;diner&quot; prices then you may be in for a bit of shock. The average price for a lunch or brunch dish is about $15.00. Dinner prices averaging about $20.00 and that does not include a salad. In addition, considering it's SF and the location, the prices are really not &quot;that&quot; bad.... especially since the food is not just your average meal. However, that being said, the portions are huge. The server even commented that anything above the sandwich list is &quot;appetizer&quot; portion. I'm not sure how much the average diner eats but everything that we ordered could have easily been split by two people.Every single person at our table enjoyed their meal. I can only fully comment on my own meal which was the organic fried egg BLT with avocado, basil aioli, on a home made wild rice sourdough. It was WONDERFUL! I was a little apprehensive about the bread based on the description but it was amazing. For the sandwich it was grilled to perfection and I could have had it sans sandwich filling. The menu doesn't state that this sandwich also comes with a side of french fries (sweet potato fries are $2.00 extra) or cole slaw. The sandwich and side was huge! The bacon was not see-through and everything was fresh. The flavors blended perfectly and I give many kudos to the chef who put it together!The Fog City Diner is a restaurant that I will return to as long as it is in existence. I have never been disappointed by the service, food, or drinks. Plus, it's just a cool place to have a meal at....

Fog City Diner is certainly not a typical &quot;diner.&quot; A friend told us that we must try Fog City Diner while we were in SF. We ate lunch outside on a beautiful June day. The service was good and the food was terrific. We were in the mood for burgers and fries so that is what we ordered. The burgers were very large (could be easily split) and delicious! We had truffle oil fries which were amazing! The prices were high if you were expecting &quot;diner&quot; but we were not. Would highly recommend!

We visited San Fran in foggy February, but were blessed with four days of cold but glorious sunshine. We ate out quite a bit, as you may imagine, but the Fog City Diner, which is on the harbour front, near Fisherman's Wharf is a great spot for lunch.It has that typical diner look from the outside- very 30s style grooved alloy, and inside mostly banquettes for four with tables. A few outside, if I remember rightly.A little pricey, diner-wise, because they generally they are low-price workmens' eateries, but this is way above the usual level. Interesting, varied menu, typical American quick, efficient, sassy service, excellent food.

After we finished our afternoon at Alcatraz, we were tired and needing a lift. The beautiful diner sounded good on electronic &quot;paper&quot; so we decided to give it a try. We each tried a couple of items from their &quot;small plates&quot; menu; standouts included the Crispy Curried Cauliflower w/ spicy thai basil aioli; 3-cheese Mac &amp; Cheese,and Grilled Chicken Satay w/ lemongrass peanut sauce. But the hit of the dinner were the malts, Chocolate malted milk shakes are a part of their Dessert menu, and have to be one of the best we've ever tried, made with vanilla bean ice cream and (I think) chocolate fudge sauce. We'll find this diner again next time we come to town. Great atmosphere &amp; attentive service.

I wish i could transport Fog City Diner to my hometown. We ate here our first night in San francisco because I vaguely remembered it from my last trip several years ago. It was a great way to start our vacarion! Our waiter, Andrew, reccomended we do several small plates to share and we did so adding salads and soup to round out our meal. It was all delicious! All of the staff was very friendly and helpful. We enjoyed the rather retro interior as well. We also ate lunch there on our last day. Although Andrew was not our waiter that time, he did remember us and even asked about our vacation. Yes it was a bit expensive, but most places around the Embarcadaro are.

So like alot of other reviewers we stumbled upon this place after an evening trip to Alcatraz.It was after 9 when we walked and we were seated quickly. Nobody came to take a drinks order but we were given water eventually. The menu selection was only ok but we found something to eat and ordered. I had fish which was very tasty and my husband had a burger which he liked. Overall the food was good but the service left a bit to be desired. Price was average for San Francisco in my opinion. Wouldn't be in a hurry back if I'm honest!

Thanks to fellow TripAdvisor contributors, we found this spot right by the pier where we were to board our boat to Alcatraz. My sweetie and followed the suggestion to have the fried fish filets (which I think were maybe Haddock?) which came with fries and a salad I believe - as well as an appetizer of small tacos. The wine and whiskey cocktails were delightful, the appetizer was tasty and the fish was amazing! Including tip for 2 people with one alcoholic drink each our bill as $68.00. This was our best meal in SF and we loved the waiter and atmosphere - nice but not stuffy with an old diner/jazz club feel. I would recommend for sure.

A buddy and I went into San Francisco from the East Bay, and decided to hit the Fog City Diner for brunch.We were seated quickly, and that was nice. However, that's pretty much where the excellent service ended. We sat in our booth for a solid 20 minutes before anyone even offered us coffee. When the waitress finally came over to the table, she apologized, saying that she thought we were her co-workers.Seriously?My buddy ordered a Bloody Mary, and he got it about 15 minutes later. What was extra-special about it was that it wasn't served on the rocks, which is customary with a Bloody Mary. He shouldn't have had to ask for ice. I ordered coffee, and I think they may have had to trek to Colombia to pick the beans.I ordered the biscuits and gravy, and it was... fine. There was nothing special about it. The biscuits might have been able to spend another minute or so in the oven, but they were fine. The sausage definitely could've used a bit more flavor. Again, it was just... fine. If I lived in San Francisco and had out of town visitors, this is not one of the places they would be eating.On a scale of 1 to 10, the food here was a 5. This is San Francisco, got Pete's sake. The food should be better. What absolutely killed the whole thing for me here was the service. It was atrocious. No one should wait 25 minutes to order coffee, and the server should save the excuses and the apologies and get with the program.If you're hungry, there are simply far too many options available along the Embarcadero, and I would highly recommend you find one...

My hubby and I saw this diner during one of our walks and made a note to go back as our city (St. John's) is also known as &quot;Fog City&quot;. The diner was a little more upscale than we anticipated, which was actually very nice. It was a cool evening so we ordered our favourite comfort foods from the menu: Hubby had a burger and I had the mac and cheese. Both came promptly and were so good. The mac and cheese was very creamy and tasty, baked in a single serving dish.I found the service very good. They were quick to take our orders and fill our water glasses, but they didn't come to our table every few minutes to ask how everything was, which I find very annoying at other restaurants. The atmosphere was also very nice. My only complaint would be that the food took some time to come, something to keep in mind if you are in a hurry. In our case, we were just there to relax, and the food was worth the wait.As I mentioned earlier, this is not your typical diner where you would see lumberjack coats and trucker caps at the counter. It's a nice, cozy restaurant, with a wide variety of food, and is therefore a bit pricier than a regular diner. Don't let the exterior fool you.

I have eaten here many times over the years. The food is usually very good. Four of us dined there recently. Two had burgers which were very good. One had the BLT which was also tasty. I had the butter lettuce pear salad and sweet potato fries. The fries were great. I would not recommend this salad. It was a pile of butter lettuce with a few slices of pears scattered around and some dressing. They forgot to put the walnuts on it as well. It was very plain...about $12 of plain salad to be more precise. Hopefully, this salad recipe will get modified. Everything else was very good.

Came here after the alcatraz tour as it is the closest restaurant to where the boat drops you off. I remembered it from the movie So I married an axe murderer and thought it would be neat to check out. We were not that hungry so we shared a mac and cheese and a sourdough bread. I had a beer as well and our bill was over $30. Checked the menu and all the meals are quite expensive. No complaints about the food tho was very yummy. Also the music was excellent made you think you were back in the 50's

The restaurant has undergone a complete renovation since we last dined here. Very open space now.

Trying out places for our son's upcoming rehearsal dinner, and had Fog City Diner recommended. Went with friends, and ordered quite a variety from the menu, starting with drinks &amp; appetizers. Drinks were nicely made &amp; fresh. Appetizers were not your run of the mill: cumin cauliflower, chicken satay, excellent oysters on the half shell. couldn't miss the mac &amp; cheese, so ordered 1 to share (with real bacon). While it was hard to decide what to order next, so many enticing selections, we settled: fish &amp; chips, pot roast, chicken schnitzel, pork chops. All were really nicely prepared &amp; upscale. finished with desserts and coffee.Location is right on the Embarcadero, easy street parking on a Saturday night. Will definitely eat here again, and not just for son's rehearsal dinner :-)

Went with friends who say it's their favorite restaurant in SF. Had made reservations and were seated right away. The menu choices were so unique and varied it took us awhile to decide. I went with the Chicken Schnitzel which was delicious. Husband had the rib eye with truffle fries which he enjoyed a lot. We split a salad which was tasty but very light on the goat cheese and walnuts it was supposed to include. 4 of us split a dessert - had to ask for utensils for that. The cake and ice cream were delicious. I would definitely eat here again, though not too often as it is pretty pricey. Nice treat while on vacation for sure.

We were in San Fran on spring break with our 8 year old son. I stumbled across the Fog Diner in a tour book and it was mentioned in my sons book from the library - San Francisco A to Z or somthing like that. Easy and fun trolley ride tom out hotel in Fishermans Wharf. We were able to get reservations on their website. We were warmly greeeted and given a lovely booth near the kitchen. Cool decor - excellent drinks. WE were excited for what they had in store!We couldn;t possible decide one an entree so did a sampling of a lot of small plates that did notdisappoint! I had the pear salad that was not only beautifully presented but delicious! We had to try the Cheddar biscuits with rosemary apple butter and my son adored them! We ordered the pork sliders (well I did but my husband could not keep his hands off them!) and the slaw - so good!My husband ordered the crabcakes and samosis and thought they were quite tasty. The service was the best of any resturant of the week and such a cool atmosphere.

We were running around San Francisco and had twenty- five minutes to eat after parking at pier 23, and before hopping on a bus tour. Literally ran into the diner. The hostess gave us immediate attention, and took orders with suggestions as to what could be prepared quickly. The staff did not mind us invading their counter area while we waited, and the man behind the counter set us all up with water to go. The hostess had our orders boxed, labeled, and bagged while never giving any indication that we were any bother at all. When we made the bus (with about 90 seconds to spare), the food was divine! I really want to go back when we have an opportunity to stay a while. Thanks, y'all!

After much research, the Fog City Diner was a must for a trip to the Fisherman's Wharf area of San Francisco. From the faux gas lanterns to the big band music playing, one can hail back to the 40s...as long as you don't look at the prices. The prices are not out of range, but this is like no diner you've ever been to. From the stellar kubota pork chop to the half-pound burger, you can't go wrong. We decided on 4 small plates, and the hoisin pork sliders were the best of the lot. Peppery crab cakes were excellent, if you like the peppers. Solid kids menu.

I found it funny that someone actually had the nerve to post that &quot; The food is small portions and expensive. ...My iced tea had no flavor of tea and I was not informed by the waiter. (what the waiter was supposed to inform you your iced tea had no flavor?) and I paid $62.00 for 2 kids snacks and 2 adult snacks with my bowl of soup.&quot; I am so glad this reviewer was not going to return. It will make the experience that more enjoyable for the rest of us who think Fog City Diner is a great place to eat.The truffle fries are to die for, the Seafood Cioppino was a portion large enough for us to share, and while we do not feed our kids &quot;snacks&quot;, they really enjoyed the sliders! The service was professional and friendly. This was a perfect place to celebrate a birthday!

The place is beautiful to look at. The food is small portions and expensive. I had a bowl of cream of mushroom soup that was watered down so much I had a hard time tasting the mushroom. My iced tea had no flavor of tea and I was not informed by the waiter. They did not charge me for the tea. I paid $62.00 for 2 kids snacks and 2 adult snacks with my bowl of soup. I will never go back here again

This is the place we have all family and friends visit when coming to San Francisco. The menu is everchanging but some staples never leave. The decor is deco and the staff still dresses as such. Macaroni and cheese is always great and the truffle fries are easy to share. The bartenders are friendly and treat you with an extra touch of class.A great San Francisco experience

I don't do restaurant reviews but we took our family along with Grandpa and Grandma to Fog City Diner after a day around SF. The meal was great. The schnitzel chicken was awesome. My kids even said &quot;my new favorite food is now crab cakes&quot;. It used to be pizza. The service was great, the kids menu made it easy and since it was my first time, I thought the ambiance was nice as well for kids. We had a party of 7. The milkshakes were also awesome.We were seated promptly per our reservation. All the food was good. The menu, per the vets in our group of FCD, was pared down, but the quality excellent.Best meal of trip.

Luckily, I was able to secure a reservation for a part of 20 as part of a work conference which included customers with less than a day's notice. Within an hour we had a menu put together and half of a private room. They were pros.With large groups, the appetizers are served family style. The Truffled French Fries with Asiago cheese went fast. The Chicken satay and onion rings were finished only slightly less quickly. I had the carrot ginger soup which had the right balance of ginger. For my main course I had the salmon and asparagus. What was most impressive was that every dish was properly cooked and seasonsed - very hard to do with a large crowd.Dessert choices were all yummy - bread pudding, molten chocolate cake or sorbet.If I am in San Francisco again, I will definitely pay a visit again.

Never pass up the truffle fries and the fresh oysters. The burger is good. Calamari, tuna tartare, clam chowder, onion rings, are favorites, and we like to get a selection of appetizers instead of a big plate, so we can have our favorites. For a big plate, the pot roast is mouth-wateringly delicious. Lemon meringue pie for dessert, which we usually have to take home. If they offer it, get the hot fudge sundae. The biggest downside is the parking situation. Very expensive meters were installed a couple of years ago, which severely curtailed our visits to this long-time favorite. $15 in the meter for a lunch spoiled our day.

If you think you are stepping into a regular dinner, think twice. You are not. This is slightly more upscale yet it is essentially an American restaurant with more refined version of your typical diner staples. I remember the Ceasar salad being really good, as was the fish.We took a group of Swiss visitors to Fog City Diner and we were super impressed with the quality of the food. We were seated in the back of the diner to accommodate the big group (20) and had a great meal for a pretty decent price. Nobody could finish dessert...they were so rich.For us the restaurant made a good lasting impression after a long week of work, running around, eating sandwiches, and meeting new people.I highly recommend it to take visitors, grab a nice lunch (event at the counter), and take a group.

I had worked a block from the Fog City Diner at Levi Strauss &amp; Co. in the late 80's and had lunch and dinner there many times so decided to return on a business trip last year. My wife had never been there and she loved the architecture - we both loved the food and wine. In this era when so many businesses are closing, it was nice to know an old friend was there and so was the quality.

I live in the SF Bay area and come here for special occaisons or sometimes for lunch. The food has always been great and this trip (my son's birthday) was no exception. Started with the great Cheese biscuits and Jalapeno cornbread along with cocktails and calamari. I had an excellent ribeye steak, my family had yummy salmon, pork chops, and hamburger. Everyone enjoyed their meal. Too stuffed for dessert.The menu is not as sophisticated as it was years ago, and some food critics have faulted the place for that. But my experience here has always been great and that's why I keep coming back.One tip that I recommend: If you order all of your courses at the beginning, often all of them will arrive too close together. I don't want my entree to come when I have just started my salad. So the tip is to order each course as you go. The food comes out of the kitchen fast, so you won't have to wait long.

We heard Fog City was the place for the best burger in San Francisco and really hope that's not true! We visited on a Saturday in the early afternoon and found the diner pretty crowded, a good sign. We were seated fairly quickly and our server was engaging. We both ordered burgers; while the menu doesn't mention it, the burgers are served with a large side of fries which was a nice surprise. We typically order burgers well done as its too hard to predict what will be served otherwise, however our server suggested medium and we agreed; we both order steak medium rare as a frame of reference. When our meals arrived we dressed the burgers, cut them in half, and found them raw. While the exterior was cooked, they were flash cooked and the entire center of each was completely raw. We pointed this out to the server who apologized and took them back to the kitchen. When he returned it was clear the cut patties were returned to the grill and cooked to a perfect medium, placed on a new bun, and delivered again. While my wife's meal was okay, they forgot to put the bacon, lettuce, and onion on my burger, and the plate was obviously left under a heat lamp as the pickle spear was cooked and shriveled. I mentioned the bacon to the server who offered to go retrieve some but I asked him to leave it alone.In the server's defense this was a kitchen problem, not a problem with the wait staff. As an apology the server delivered a dessert after our meal.While the burger, when it was finally made right, was good, it was not great. Perhaps other food is better at Fog City, but frankly when I'm in San Francisco again I'll try some other restaurant rather than take my chances here.

I've always loved the look of the fog city diner, especially as it was featured in 'so i married an axe murderer'. I was last here in 1991, bet returned this year with my new wife for a birthday meal. We found it to be really really great. We were a little late getting in, but were welcomed by friendly staff. Our waitress was genuinely friendly and interested in speaking to us. The diner is so well maintained - finish is really top notch, and booths very comfortable. The food was amazing. We had main and dessert, with the price being just a little more than run of the mill chain places - WELL worth the extra. Special mention for the creme brulee - wow it was good! atmosphere inside very nice and chilled with great music. bar incredible. all in all a very special night, and this is now one of our favorite spots in the city.

I ws here a few years go when it was more like a high quality diner.( I think I had mac n'cheese and a couple of beers) Not really a diner now and underachieves for the price. too expensive for the overall quality. Wanted to try the first courses we ordered ( &quot;small plates&quot;) before deciding to have a&quot; large plate&quot;as a 2nd course or another small plate Felt pressured by the staff to choose and was actually asked whilst still eating the first course to decide. One of the starters was the stir fried brussel sprouts...not sure if it was supposed to be burnt, however the crabcakes were excellent. Fish and chips were nothing compared to anything you would routinely get in UK or my favourite fish resturant in Berlin ( crisp batter and flakey cod with thick cut fries not thin fillets i think in breadcrumbs and standard fries) but the tartare sauce was very good. Spareribs were OK There are other places in San Francisco where you can eat similar for less. The style and ambience of the restaurant is a big attraction and the food is OK but based upon other reviews I expected better Overall felt disappointed

Stopped for lunch when waiting to go to Alcatraz. We got there quite early - 12.30 ish and they were already busy. We could not get a seat outside (but this might have been because there was a bicycle race just down the road) but got seated by a window inside very quickly.The service was excellent and the food really good too. We shared the tacos and a burger and it was lovely and fresh, really tasty and served promptly and nicely.My only complaint is that they do not have enough toilets so although very clean you do have to wait quite a while!

Retrain The Hostess, Good Food

I walked the block and sat in the park next door until 11:32 - they open at 11:30am. When I arrived, the hostess promptly told me it would be ten minutes and I could wait outside. I asked her if my watch was wrong and she allowed me to sit at the bar...after I suggested it. (There was an elderly gentleman that received the same treatment who opted to remain at the bar for his meal.) 11:40 came and went and the hostess seated 2 tables. I finally made my way back to the hostess stand to remind her of my existence and she found a table. It is strange that a small incident like this ruins it for me but I don't like being made to feel like an imposition and it steams me to see an 80 year old man treated poorly.Ironically, table service was great. I had the black bean soup and fish tacos - both were good. I would recommend the Mac and Cheese and the chicken schnitzel from previous experience.

My system does not handle gluten well, so I can't eat wheat. I ordered the rib eye with fries, which were tasty. Then I wanted dessert.The menu boasts a flourless chocolate cake, and I love chocolate. I asked the server to check with the chef to make sure the dessert is completely free of flour and wheat. I had told the server several times during the evening (as he explained the daily specials, etc.) that I could not eat wheat. The server checked with the chef, and then he told me the cake had no wheat/flour at all. Great! I ordered the dessert.The dessert comes with a topping - little chocolate &quot;drops&quot; or &quot;pearls.&quot; I grabbed three of them with my fork in one bite. Then I felt the *crunch* when I bit into them. Please, oh please let that be rice, I thought. I asked the server to please check again with the chef - does the topping have wheat? The server checked again, and, yes, the topping contains wheat.I am now in a lot of pain as the wheat makes it through my system. The manager stopped me as I left the restaurant to apologize, but of course, it was too late. There was nothing that could be done once the wheat had entered my system.Please be careful if you have any food allergies and eat at this restaurant. Ask to see the ingredients list for yourself.The service was otherwise slow but friendly.

My husband and I ate here on our visit to San Francisco - after seeing this restaurant featured on Food Network. It's a diner, but the food is much tastier than your typical diner fare. We had a bunch of small plates - the corn chowder (incredibly rich), curry cauliflour, calamari (yummy and not chewy!), chicken satay strips. I ate most of the small plates and my husband had the pot roast as his main meal. Everything was tasty and the food exceeded our expectations.We also had dessert - I had creme' brulee' and he had the bread pudding. Both were fantastic. We'd eat here again if/when we're back in San Francisco

Had a very late lunch (early dinner?) at the diner during our March San Fran visit. We had a great meal - this is not your average diner. First we ordered the combination bread basket - one of the best items we had during our week in San Francisco. Jalapeno cornbread with red pepper jelly, a sourdough loaf with garlic and butter, and cheddar biscuits. Yum! My husband ordered a green salad - don't remember what cheese and which nuts it included but it was delicious. And I had the pot roast with vegetables - incredibly savory and I would absolutely order it again (although a look at the web menu today suggests that it is not available this time of year). No room for dessert - not after that bread basket! Service was very good, in fact, if anything a little too formal for us. So all in all a great experience, although the second most expernsive meal we had in the city. I would highly recommend FCD, as long as you are not anticipating a regular diner experience or prices.

Becca, our server, gave us the &quot;bums rush&quot; from the time we sat down. It took much to long for her to show up at our table and then when she arrived she wanted to know if we had decided, never volunteered any information, certainly not any of the specials. I found out that there were in fact specials after she offered them to an adjacent table when we were well into our entree. She never asked if we would care for another drink even though my husband had no beverage for the majority of the meal. This was the worst service we've had in years. All that said, the truffle fries were pretty great, but not enough for us to go back.

We decided to visit a new restaurant on our last night in SF even though we had eaten at three other good eating places; we were not disappointed.The Diner was originally the Officers' Mess and is lovely inside with lots of polished wood and separate booths along one side. We rang to check they had a table and as a result they saved us a booth. (If we are lucky enough to visit SF again we would ring and request a booth as it really added to the experience for us).The service was excellent, the waiter was really informative about what was good to eat and was attentive but not overly so. We ate delicious Clam Chowder, Crab, Chicken Snitzel, Burger and fish. Vegetables were cooked really well.This is a long way from your bulk standard diner and indeed does not open until late morning. Would definitely recommend for a restaurant type meal. Delicious.

My boyfriend &amp; I shared the pot roast (recommended by our waitress) as well as the mac n cheese. Both were incredible. The pot roast melted in your mouth and the mac n cheese was just perfect - indulgent &amp; cheesey &amp; perfect.We had some mildly annoying children sitting on the table next to us who could not stop screaming &amp; running around, but I won't hold that against anyone - kids will be kids. There are funny little plaques around the restaurant (like by the coat rack) that you need to read - they were cute!The best part of our experience there was that the food was so good, my boyfriend left his credit card there!

Was told about this restaurant from friends who had visited many years before. We were staying on the Wharf and could easily walk to this establishment. Didn't have reservations but were sat at the bar while we waited for a table. We had enough time to have one drink and our table was ready The restaurant has a great atmosphere, loud but not obnoxious. Looks just like a diner should but with an upscale feel. The crab cake appetizer was delicious. I had panfried sole with asparagus and pureed cauliflower. It was delicious. My partner had cioppino which was good but we did have the same dish at a seafood restaurant another night and it was slightly better there. Great wine choice by our waiter to go with both of our meals. I have to say the desserts alone would be worth dining there. My partner had a bread pudding with a cinammon bourbon sauce and cinammon ice cream which was to die for!Don't let the word &quot;diner&quot; fool you. It is not greasy diner food. Dress up a little and enjoy a fantastic meal at a great restaurant!

I ordered the mussels they were ok served in a Red Curry sauce with a side of sourdough bread... I prefered the Rosemary Garlic bread instead (did I mention that this bread was glistening with butter and garlic?) mmm hmmm If I go another time I will not be ordering the Mussels they were &quot;fishy&quot; smelling.Dessert selection I hear is OUTSTANDING but we didn't order as we had to head out to the Disney museum for Cerise BF to check it out over at the Presidio.Full bar and great service Happy Hour begins at 3:00pm - 6:00pm PERFECT!Respectfully Reviewed

The only &quot;diner&quot; about the Fog City is the name and the fact that it is a silver diner-appearing&quot; building. The menu changes per season and there are no milkshakes, etc.I had really great fish tacos and my husband had a very good chicken schnitzel(spelling?)with garlic mashers. We sat outside for lunch and it was lovely. The menu when we were there had numerous interesting items which I considered like ahi tartare with quail egg (don't think any regular diner has ever had that on the menu)

Not fancy and mostly frequented by tourists, I think, but we had a good experience here. Made a reservation on OpenTable, we were seated immediately, the waiter was friendly and helpful and always around when he was needed. Traditional old-fashioned diner decor. Definitely a diner menu with a lot of comfort food, but well prepared and presented, generously sized drinks. I had the pot roast and the apple tart which were both quite good. Bread pudding with ice cream was humongous.

Two of us went for dinner. Had the Truffle Fries (FF with truffle oil and topped with grated cheese - great with beer). Every plate has a twist. My salmon came on a bed of veggies and fried gnocchi- really flavorful and lighter than i though they would be. The Cioppino was a large plate of well mixed seafood in a light red sauce. Desserts were varied and plentiful and coffee/capuccino slection was very good. A bit pricey ($120 for the two of us- soup to nuts). Easy parking on the nearby streets using the pay meters.

We actually happened across the dinner on our way back from Alcatraz, we were actually looking for a coffee and a beer... That we got and more! Ended up sitting at the bar to begin with, coffee turned to wine and the atmosphere was great. We ended up deciding to say for something to eat and moved to one of the tables. Food was good, our waiter tried really hard, and the atmosphere was okay (we were actually seated around the back - a little quieter than the main area). Overall a very enjoyable experience.

This restaurant has a wonderful upscale &quot;diner&quot; ambiance and outstanding food. I had crispy Japanese pumpkin with gorgonzola fondue, shaved fennel and cinnamon grain mustard vinaigrette. This was one of the best dishes I've ever had! The flavors, textures, temperatures (some cool ingredients and some warm) and presentation were outstanding! Every mouthful was magical. The pumpkin was amazing!.... crispy on the outside and firm on the inside.... I thought cooked to perfection! I had this with an excellent New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc. For dessert I had another outstanding dish: fuyu persimmon, cranberry and golden delicious apple crisp with vanilla bean ice cream. I ended with an excellent espresso. Service was ordinary.

We were taken to the Fog City Diner by some new friends to experience San Fran. cuisineIt is great. Very central and a great atmosphere. Retro in design and VERY smart. Like an old milk-bar type set-up except it is VERY up-to-date. Bright and shiny.The staff was attentive, although our waitresses, who had been very charming was upset because of a miscalculation in the tip. This was because there were two separate accounts....but is was sorted.The food was great and there was a good selection. we went elsewhere for dessert just to experience another restaurant

Interesting menu of modern American versions of comfort food. The cheese biscuits with apple butter are a nice starter. The cioppino was not the classic SF version, but had a &quot;kick&quot; with a hint of asian spices. The desserts were immense, clearly intended to be shared.Good selection of California wines by the glass, as well as local draft beers.The service was friendly, quick, and efficicient. For its tourist location, and interesting menu the prices were surprisingly reasonable.

The title says it all. If you are heading to San Francisco, don't waste your time or money. My wife and I recently visited California for 10 days, driving up from San Diego and ending our trip in San Francisco for the last 3 days. We were very excited for lots of delicious foods when we got to San Fran. We had some fantastic meals all along the way, sprinkled in with some that were not all that great, but on the last morning in San Francisco we decided to hit the Fog City Diner, which we had passed by earlier in the week. When we passed by the placed was packed, and my wife told me that she had seen something on The Food Network about Fog CIty. Well, I have no idea what could have been so good about the place for The Food Network to spotlight it. First off, I was hungry for breakfast, a regular eggs and bacon breakfast that you get in ANY so called DINER. We got there at almost 11am, and I thought they may not even be serving breakfast anymore. I was wrong. They didn't serve breakfast AT ALL, in fact they hadn't even opened up yet. What kind of a diner doesn't open up until lunch time I ask? Well, the awful, fake a$$ kind of diner who wants to look sophisticated and upscale and then gouge the customers for overpriced Denny's food. Actually Denny's would be a vast improvement. We rolled up at 11, they told us they open at 11:30, no big deal, we decided to kill time for a half an hour in the park and come back. We come back and are the first customers in the door. We ask for a high chair for our infant son. The hostess must have gone across town to retrieve a high chair. Next, the menu was very limited, not that I would mind so much if the food was good, but oh well, our expectations were high, after all they were spotlighted on Food Network. My father in law who was along for the trip, ordered some clam chowder, the waitress obviously wrote it down, but the chowder never came, and when we mentioned it again to her, she just shrugged it off and said oh I didn't hear you. Whatever. So I come from Pennsylvania, where diners are CHEAP and GOOD. I realize that things are expensive in San Francisco, and that's all good, so I figure the $14.00 cheeseburger ought to be pretty tasty. I noticed that any other toppings on the burger are $1.00 a piece, so if you want a really tasty burger, you can bank on close to $20.00. This was already strike 3 for the place in my opinion and I hadn't even placed my order yet. When I did get my burger it just flat out sucked. I was so hungry that I ate it without complaint anyway, because I didn't want to ruin anyone elses morning, but when the waitress asked how it was, I wanted to tell her &quot;not nearly as good at In and Out, and only 4 times the price&quot;. The rest of the families meals were not much better and about $100.00 later we all walked out of the place feeling violated. Even the local tourist magazine at our rental suggested to go there for the scenic views, but there isn't even much to look at. A busy street along the Embarcadero alongside a bunch of piers. The only thing really good to say about the place in my opinion was that they had spotless windows.

Having read conflicting reviews of this landmark San Francisco restaurant, I went with some concerns. However, they were unfounded as this is a great place with good food, excellent warm and friendly service and a good choice of drinks although like all American restaurants, the price of wine is high - how can Australian wine be cheaper than Californian grown a few miles away?Go for the experience, enjoy the style and remember that this is not a greasy spoon diner - much more up-market. Enjoy !

We had plans later in the day on the Fisherman's Wharf and wanted to see Coit Tower. This restaurant is steps (LOL!) to the Coit Tower steps that lead to one of the best views of SF and the Bay...We had Sunday brunched and had a great meal. We opted to sit outside as it was a beautiful spring day. So nice to be off the main street and in more residential road. Had great, prompt service. The Bloody Mary's were unique (waitress wouldn't tell us the secret ingredient), and worth the visit alone.Started off with with the Jalapeno Corn bread and wished we got the basket of all three. Unique and to die for. I had the cheddar biscuit with sausage gravy---it was a bit heavy, but flavorful. Friend had the Smoked chicken Hash--which I would highly recommend. Not too spice or heavy, but with lots of flavour.We had a GREAT experience for Brunch .

I've been going to this restaurant off and on for the past several years and the I'm not sure that when I get back to the Bay area, that i would go back again. The service was dreadfully slow, the food was OK and it's a bit over priced (yeah I know, its downtown, near the waterfront and all, but...). My colleague and i ordered a salad, hamburgers, the garlic bread and 3 beers and it was close to $90.00 with tip. A little tough on my expense account these days. On the street parking was free, as it was after 6. Nice atmosphere and location.

My partner and I were looking for a quick bite while walking through San Francisco. As we were pressed for time (trying to get to an event), we were happy to come across a diner. Generally, when I think of a diner, I think of a place to grab a quick and cheap bite that may or may not be very good. Fog City offered the opposite: fabulous and moderately expensive food at a snail's pace. We both ordered grilled chicken sandwiches with great toppings. The fries could not have been better. However, the service was inattentive. When we first arrived, we sat about 10 minutes before the server came to get our drink order. I finished my glass of water halfway through the meal, and it was never refilled. I would go back for that chicken sandwich, but only if I had extra time to linger over my meal.

Sandy Salad
Rating: 4
Date: January 16, 2009

This diner is smaller than it looks from the outside, and the wood and lighting etc. are unusually attractive. You think it's gonna be funky but instead it's classy. The host, a nattily dressed gentlman, was quite charming and should be given a raise. Fog City has a limited menu. Short, I would call that a short menu. Took about 2 minutes to read the whole thing. There is almost nothing for children and vegetarians. The prices are kind of up there, but not crazy. I ordered a salad with pears and bleu cheese. It looked beautiful, but there were only four tiny cubes of pear. The lettuce was gritty. I was in a huge rush because I was working at a theater and had to leave in 15 minutes. I just kept hoping it would get better. When the waitress came by, I told her (I figured she'd appreciate the feedback) but I also said I didn't have time to get a new salad. She said, &quot;Oh, I saw them washing the lettuce, they wash the lettuce really well.&quot; You know, that's not a helpful comment. So I'm either lying, stupid or I exist in some invalid reality. She meant well and was a nice person, but the professional, consumer-friendly thing to say is &quot;I'm sorry'. She offered me a new salad, but I didn't have time. I ate becaue I was starving and I was running late. She did not take the salad off my bill, which I can understand, but it would have been nice if she did. The onion rings were excellent. I will return when I have plenty of time to send back the sandy salad.

We came here 5 years ago on vacation and returned recently, our fond memories of the place firmly guiding us to expect the same terrific type of experience. Such a huge disappointment!Although a lot of the menu items are the same, what we received was a pallid comparison to the original thing. Truffle fries, while good, seem like a hastily-thrown-together cheap substitute for the real thing (which used to be truly excellent). Burger was good (expensive) but not great. Children's menu is sadly tiny, unimaginative and very overpriced ($7 for buttered noodles with nothing else? Really?), and they weren't willing to do a half-portion of any of the menu items instead. Also, the meal we ordered for our young daughter didn't even arrive until 10 minutes after ours(!). Smoked chicken hash was greasy, lukewarm, and had almost no actual chicken in it (lots of shredded potato and uncooked peppers). Bloody Mary was room temperature and bland (like getting tomato juice from the can). When I ordered another, just a little spicier please, I got something that was so hot it was ridiculous and actually painful to take a swallow (my husband called it &quot;smart-[----] hot&quot;). Glass salt shaker had a giant chip in the bottom where salt was actually spilling out. We got a lot of &quot;Sorry about that&quot; and no other real resolution. Sad to say, we won't be returning, and our once-fond memories are no more.

We split a Japanese eggplant and onions appetizer - tasty but smallish portion for the cost. I went &quot;upscale&quot; ordering the Filet Mignon &quot;cooked medium&quot; with bleu cheese mashed potatoes and broccolini for $23. Nice price if the quality of the dish matches, but it didn't. The filet was overcooked (came out medium - well, almost well done), and still managed to be lukewarm. IThe mashed potatoes were almost cool. t must have sat on the counter for 10 minutes waiting to be delivered to my table. I almost never send back meals, but should have done so this time. The other person in my party had better luck with a burger (nice portion) topped with cheddar cheese, mushrooms and onions. It came with crispy, tasty fries for $15. I should have done the burger.Wine by the glass is a bit on the pricey side, given that the other dishes appear to be more reasonable.Last comment: We were seated in what I thought was a good location - in the &quot;echo&quot; room, next to glass windows looking out on to the Embarcadero. Good people watching location. I then learned two things: 1) the &quot;echo&quot; room is given that name because of the unique accoustics. Conversations taking place on the other side of the room are amplified such that it seems they are sitting right next to you. You can hear EVERYTHING being said (so naturally we started whispering!), and 2) we couldn't help noticing a few very small flying bugs on the windows, which almost drove me out of the restaurant completely. There was no place to move and I wasn't interested in trying to find another San Francisco restaurant to go to on a Friday night in high tourism season.Overall, unless you want a hamburger, I'd go somewhere else.

Fog City Diner is a diner type retaurant just off the Embarcadero in San Francisco, roughly between the Ferry Building and Pier 39. It is an attractively decorated building with aluminum siding on the outside and stained wood booths and tables on the inside, giving it an Art-Deco feel.Menu items are upscale version of old diner favorites; garlic fries, mac-n-cheese, burgers, etc.Service is professional if not warm and friendly.Items delivered included a corn-clam chowder; thin and watery, missing its corn, and with a handful of clams,not all of which were fit to eat. Garlic fries came well prepared and seasoned. A cream of asparagus soup was well executed. A hanger steak was fairly prepared, a tiny steak at that, and came with nibs of corn garnishing the potato side.In all, small portions for the amount charged, stiff yet professional service, and a bit noisy inside.One ought to do better in San Francisco.

I went here with some friends. This place is easily noticeable from Embarcadero with the shiny exterior that glares at cars driving by. Luckily, it's not like that inside. The food is ok, I ended up getting the Buffalo burger, I liked my friends food better. For an appetizer, get the fries, it's a gigantic mound of fries which is worth it, if you like fries covered in cheese.

Stumbled across this traditional diner after descending the Filbert steps from Coit Tower, yes we walked up from the other side. The descent was amazing such a beautiful haven, how fit you must be to live up here. We were thirsty and it was gone 12, well it was actually about 2.30pm so called in for a quick drink and ended up staying a couple of hours.We had such fun being entertained with magic tricks at the bar, even getting to test one of the new wines they were having. Yes it is touristy but hey it's also a traditional diner what more could you want from an afternoon in SF.We enjoyed our time there that we even ventured back one lunch time to sample the food. Really good and boy the portions were too big for me. To find it walk past Pier 39 Southward keep going till you reach Battery and it is across the road. You cannot miss it. Worth a little side trip. Well we think it is.Go try for yourself you will love or hate it.

We stopped at Fog City Diner on Easter morning this year, for breakfast before we headed back home to SoCal. It was recommended to us by some locals on the streetcar, so we gave it a try. A wonderful surprise! I had a delicious omelette with asparagus and mushrooms, my husband had the steak and eggs. Very good food, excellent atmosphere and great service. A short walk off of the &quot;F&quot; Street streetcar in the Embarcadero area, and because it was such a beautiful morning, we sat outside. Our waitress was very attentive. We truly enjoyed ourselves at Fog City and look forward to returning again.

We were riding the F-line along the Embarcadero discussing where we wanted to have dinner, when my husband spotted this cute little (very snazzy) diner. We made a spur of the moment decision to go there and got off the trolley. The menu wasn't quite what we expected - a bit more upscale than what you think of as &quot;diner food&quot;, but they did have hamburgers (which was what we'd hoped for) so we stayed for dinner. A hamburger and fries was about $12, which is a bit much, but I must say it was a truely delicious meal. It was on a wonderful bun and the meat was flavorable and very good. The condiments were served separately so you could put on what you liked. Mayo was not included, but when we asked if it was available, it was quickly brought. The fries were outstanding. I'm not a big fry lover, but these were not your normal fries. The outsides were crisp and they didn't feel or taste oily as is so often the case. The whole meal was memorable - which is weird to say for a hamburger. They did have a few other options for around $10, but mostly the entrees were in the $15 - $20 range. We went early and by the time we finished our meal there was a line of people waiting. It's located at 1300 Battery Street right where it runs into The Embarcadero. They have a website [-----------]- .

The woman who was seating parties forgot about us, causing a 20 minute wait to be a 45 minute wait and did not apologize when we asked her if she had overlooked us, but seated us right away at one of several open booths/tables. Our waiter lavished attention on the table opposite us, six people who were ordering multiple drinks each and many, many small plates, while we were two people who were ordering a usual-sized meal and no drinks. We sat with water only for 20 minutes. After not getting dessert for at least that long, I complained to the manager. Dessert appeared immediately, and the waiter told us that he had noticed it wasn't warmed enough so he had sent it back, causing the delay. He did not tell us this until after we complained. The food was nothing special for the price, and the small plates were minute--the scallop dish had two very small scallops in sauce and some arugula on the side, much smaller than any appetizer I have ever ordered. The general impression we got was that the staff needs to be attentive to all diners, not just regulars or ones who will leave a big tip because of a big check. With so many wonderful places to eat in San Francisco, we recommend that you skip this one.

Prior to a Giants game my wife and I decided to dine again at the Fog City Diner. We had eaten there several times before and wanted to see if it was &quot;holding up&quot; Happy to say it was.Always something interesting on the menu-like fried green tomatos. Always a great wines by the glass selection and a waitperson that knew what they were doing. This restaurant remains a standard for me that very few others meet. Sure, there are restaurants that offer more complex cuisine but none are as &quot;all around&quot; good as Fog City.
