Stopped in for breakfast on my one morning in SF as I'd heard from multiple sources that this place was unmissable, and it was well worth the walk there.I ordered the much lauded and instagrammed avocado toast and a black coffee. It's now two weeks later and I'm still thinking about it. Can't wait to be back in the area to try more from the amazing looking menu.Staff, service, atmosphere were all great.

We walked here from hotel nikko as i like healthier natural food &amp; less tourist places!There was a small queue at 9am the main server sadly had little warmth and couldn't even muster a smile or a hello!(maybe had a long week?)The homemade granola was nice a bit too sweet...they do almond milk coffee which is a bonus.It was a busy place (not as busy as everywhere we walked past) with a constant but very fast moving queue we only had to wait 5minutes to get a seat (you order then get a table) &amp; it soon emptied out after 9.30am.Full of local hipsters!The menu is great if you like eggs / sourdough / fresh bread.

Black lotus rice porridge with coconut milk and fresh fruit yum,orWarm quinoa bowl with kale, sweet potatoes and Brussels sprouts-add poached eggs for an awesome finishing touch, or maybe the avocado mash with pickled jalapenos and scallions on top comes with a poached egg but add another, my son votes for the spicy baked eggs, oh hell, everything is good and satisfying, with awesome fresh baked breads,cookies,and pastries and coffee. If you go during the holidays, don't miss the twice baked pumpkin almond croissants.The place is small, and it's seat yourself, but seats open up quickly. Don't let the neighborhood scare you into staying away from this gem! You might even run into Frances McDormand and her famous in his own right hubby here.

A colleague and I popped in here for breakfast, just around the corner from our hotel.I had an outstanding cappuccino and a delightful pastry called a citrus brioche. Both were perfect and I will return on a future trip.

Always incredible

This cafe is the same every year i come to SF.Always a bit of a hike from my hotel BUT always worth the walk. whilst in SF came here every morning for coffee and breakfast.The coffee standard in Australia is a lot different to the USA so it was amazing to find a cafe that matches what i am used to back home.Each morning i tried a different breakfast menu.. ALL incredible , these two are my favourites:Egg white sandwich - surprisingly tastyVegan granola - amazing , i wish i could have this every morning in Australia!Baked Eggs - oh my goodness, no wordsCoffee - always on point A+

A handful of us walked all the way from Howard street after the valet recommended Jane on Larkin to us! The hot chocolate was handed over within minutes of ordering and the avocado toast was to die for. Absolutely worth the walk through the shady streets of SFO!

Great name &amp; cafe but staff with attitude

Good cafe if you're nearby but staff too cool for school (esp woman with gingery hair on till) &amp; downer musicNo English breakfast tea - was given earl grey with half &amp; half apparently 'something similar' ....

I visited Jane on Larkin on a Saturday around noon. I was swayed to stop in after viewing photos on social media &amp; reading about the delicious coffee.I ordered a latte &amp; a gluten free brownie to stay and waited about 3 minutes before getting a table to sit after a table of 2 left. One of the gentleman cleaning the tables was a bit rude when I asked if he could grab the coffee mug that was leftover from the last customers.The latte wasn't on the strong side which was a bit disappointing since that's what drew me to Jane. The gluten free brownie was an absolute delight! A fudgy chocolate center covered by a light crunch outside. So good, I bought one to bring back to my boyfriend. The gentleman who cleared the table rang me up and was a bit nicer this time around.I was tempted to grab another treat to try - there are a ton of delicious looking baked goods available (and VARIETY), but I didn't want to be greedy!*I walked over from Union Square. The neighborhood isn't the greatest so keep a lookout &amp; be safe!

Area it is in didn&#39;t make us feel comfortable

Good breakfast but coming from the UK, didn't feel comfortable walking the 3 blocks from our hotel, past all the poor people either sleeping rough or going through the bins.

Salmon platter and pastries were great! My son enjoyed his huge plate of granola with fresh fruit. Nice design and wonderful staff.

We are breakfast here a few weeks ago - the food and coffee is good but nothing particularly special, and the whole place feels like it's trying a little bit too hard to be cool. Unfortunately the pecks reflects this, so it's not particularly cheap. It is a good spot for people-watching though!

Wish I could start everyday at Jane!

I've been to Jane twice now and I wish there was one on the East Coast. The fruit is fresh and plump, the scones are absolutely some of the best I've ever had. It's a great cappucino that they brew - woke me right up! Sure it's a bit pricey, but worth every penny. It's a bright, stylish shop with great tunes playing in the background.

Avocado toast!

Right in the middle of The Tenderloin (google it if you don't know what that means) your taste buds will cry for their coffee and breakfast. A very cute coffee and bread making spot this will for sure be at the top of our list every visit. Get the avocado toast and enjoy the most refreshing breakfast around. Love it here!

Fantastic breakfast

Don't miss this place if you are looking for a fresh modern breakfast! I had the avocado toast and it was lovely. My friend had the chia pudding and according to her it was the best chia pudding she had eaten! The coffee is great too. I will definately come back. Tomorrow!!

Great spot to eat in and outstanding baked bread to take away

We have been to Jane on Larkin and Jane on Fillmore. Both have great, high quality bread, pastries, food and smoothies. This time, we sampled the ham and cheese croissant (amazing), the yogurt with granola (as expected but very good), green smoothie (awesome) and egg white sandwich. The sandwich was packed with fluffy egg whites, avocado and hot sauce (we chose to leave off the cheese) and it was simply delicious.The coffee is wonderful and the staff are great.The neighborhood looks a little rough but it really isn't. If you aren't familiar with San Francisco, one block can be great and the next block look a little tough. Don't let that bother you. In fact, the some of the ritziest hotels in town at Nob Hill are just a few blocks from the &quot;tenderloin.&quot;On the day we were at Jane, the service was very, very slow despite not being too crowded. That is the only thing that made this a 4 star rather than a 5 star review.Highly recommend that you give it a try. The prices are quite fair for the location (SF) and the quality.

Great coffee, eclectic and energetic.

This great place has become my go to coffee source while visiting in San Francisco. Great baked goods, a limited but well done breakfast menu and delicious, artfully presented coffees. The help are a treat to deal with and great visually to a people watcher like myself.Patronized by an eclectic group of San Fran city folk it bustles with friendly energy. My latte was a work of art, love this place!

I'd been a longtime fan of Jane on Instagram before I finally got a chance to visit the bakery while on a business trip. I cannot say enough about this place, their breads, the coffee and (not least) their staff. The fig and walnut bread, sourdough bread and kouignamann (sweet puff pastry) are of such high level of craft and taste. The neighborhood it's in (Tenderloin) might be a little sketchy at times, but you should be fine exercising minimal caution. Definitely a place to visit of you're interested in bread baking,or love bread, coffee and/or pastries with all your heart :)

Actually stumbled across jane on our way to mr holmes &amp; knowing jane on Fillmore we knew they did great coffee. This location is no exception. We also had a salad &amp; sandwich for a light lunch &amp; both were good.

Great coffee. Good pastries.You really won't need any signage to find this wonderful coffee shop in the neighborhood. All you need to do is just follow scent and sight (perhaps with the help of some modern technology). This lovely cafe crafted up some top notched espresso drinks and artisanal baked goods. Step in for a drink and enjoy the sunfilled room in a lazy afternoon, weekends really don't get better than this.

Best quiche ever!! We tried two different , one with broccoli and one with spicy sausage. Normally vegetables get saggy in quiches-not here!! The sausage in the other one was very tasty. Good produce. Coffee perfect! Friendly staff. Soon coming back!! Then bringing som bread home to try as well as we have not found a great bakery in SF for bread yeat. Great value as well, nice clean decor. Eat in or take out available.

Great pumpkin croissants

Jane on larkinContext: we've been twice, once as a twosome, once with five people both in the late morning.Atmosphere: sunny, open space with lots of tables, probably seating for 20. Wifi available. Biggest issue for many is the tenderloin within which the cafe rests. If you want to avoid most of that area, come via Sutter street, which is just north of the cafe. Order at the counter, take a seat and they will being the food. Customers can be friendly.Coffee: very strong coffee and some unusual choices like an on tap iced coffee. Not for the faint hearted. Also, an intriguing selection of tea.Food: really excellent pastries. The twice baked pumpkin croissant is flaky and gooey with real pumpkin and pepitas. They have rolls and Danishes as well. They will heat the cinnamon roll for you. They also serve meals but we haven't ordered that.
