We visited the Alamo Square Seafood Grill because it was close to our accommodation and because of its high ratings. Although we had a good time, it was not an evening that merited a &quot;5&quot; rating. Food was tasty, but not inspired, and the steak on the menu (offered as an option for non-pescatarians) was overcooked. That said, this place is the type of cozy and friendly place that anyone would welcome in a neighbourhood. We were delighted to learn that on Mondays the wine list is half-price.

We were excited to try this place out. We showed up early for our reservation, she (the host?) rudely told me she would not be able to seat us until 10 min before reservation. That would have been fine, but they had a ton of tables open, no one was waiting, and it was the way she said it! I then went to tell my friends and she rudely asked us to wait outside. I then changed my reservation on open table to move it up (it was available) and she ignored us. I gave it 1 star because people seemed to be enjoying the meals, but we never got to try the food.... we left and went to a friendly amazing Mexican place near by!

Food was excellent, service pretty slow. Verrrrry long delay between appetizers and entrees, but to their credit were perfectly cooked. Had grilled salmon, calamari appetizer, and also a salad on the specials menu, and you probably would be in good shape ordering just about anything here.

This is not the place you go in a hurry. But if you have time to linger and want a great meal, you should try it. Get reservations! The server took all the orders and then served the restaurant on his own. It is that intimate. He was patient and friendly but very efficient. Our food was fantastic. Moist fish and full of flavor. Will definitely return!

A must-visit restaurant whenever I'm in town. A small dining area with big time entrees. The fish entrees have always been moist and flavorful. Although &quot;seafood&quot; is in their name, I've enjoyed extremely well prepared steak and chicken dishes. If your on a strict budget, inquire about their diner specials from 5:30pm to (I think) 7pm. Make a reservation and enjoy the best of San Francisco.

Our party of six was pleasantly surprised by the high quality and flavorful taste of every entree and appetizer. The restaurant is small but the single server did an excellent job of getting the orders correct and to the table as soon as possible. Two servers probably would have been beneficial but then the prices would most likely be higher. Be patient and enjoy an excellent dining experience. A must try eatery!

We had a lovely meal here. We booked online beforehand which I'd recommend. There seemed to be around 4 tables waiting to be seated for the entire time we were there - it gets busy so booking ahead is definately a plan. Slow service unfortunately as there simply isn't enough staff so be prepared to wait.We'd go back but when we had more time.

This seafood restaurant was recommend by friends. It is in a nice neighborhood close to the famous &quot;painted ladies&quot; Victorian homes on Alamo square. Several of us had the pre fix dinner which was a great deal. We bought our own wine and the corkage was not bad. I think they were training people as we had to ask for bread. Our server was right there with the meals. I would go back again .

Great food and not very expensive. We both had the prix fixe dinner, including soup or salad, trout with rice and mixed vegetables, and a meringue dessert. It was interesting, delicious, and $14.95. The news must be out because it was crowded at 6:15 on a Sunday night. Reservations are available through Open Table.

Great starters I had Calamari, other half had ceveche,lovely and fresh, mains were just as good &quot; chicken and Red Snapper&quot; too full for dessert. A most enjoyable evening meal. We found this through Tripadvisor. Well worth a look. 10/10

Very nice little neighbourhood venue. Only about a dozen tables, with a small but very tasty menu focused largely around (no surprise) some very tasty seafood. I had crabcakes to start (very good), the snapper (fish very good, the green peppercorn sauce was a little bland), and then a most exquisite floating island - the best dessert I have had for many months, bar none.

I've eaten here a number of times, and have consistently enjoyed our meals. It's a great value . The food is very good. Lively and casual atmosphere. Andre, the owner, is very accommodating. Among other items, they are known for having 4 different fishes, which you can have cooked one of 4 different ways, then served with one of 6 different sauces. It's a great concept, you can have it your way. I'll be back

This is a small restaurant - seats maybe 30 people with an interesting menu of both meat, veggies, and seafood options. The wait staff were lovely. The special seared Ahi tuna with broccolini and smashed potatoes was delicious. My husband had the Beef Bourganoun (sp?) and licked the plate. Dessert was a molten chocolate cake. The background music was soft jazz and the noise level was OK for conversation.

I was super excited to visit this restaurant tonight. One of my good friend was in town tonight and we decided to go celebrate his birthday there. I had made reservation tonight on OPENTABLE for 7:30pm for 3 people. We arrived early around 7:15pm. I enter the restaurant and told I believe a &quot;French, Tall, Skinny frame...Collar shirt and jeans guy&quot; that we are early but if there's no table yet...We will wait but letting you know that we are here. He was absolutely extremely RUDE and said &quot;Not yet...GO WAIT outside&quot;.7:30 came and still no table or anyone giving us any update. We waited outside with another couple.7:42 pm - The French guy I'm assuming that he's the owner...came out with 2 glasses and a bottle of White Wine...Went over to the couple that is waiting outside and offer a glass of wine to both of them. He walk back into the restaurant after pouring them each a glass of wine and did not acknowledge us or give us updates about our table.7:52 pm - Finally, he come out with both hands up in the air and said &quot;OOOOOKAAAY&quot; Table is ready...no apology!!! Seated us and we were promptly served water.8:04 pm - Again, The French guy comes over and start taking our order...Not half way taking our order he put his order pad down...said &quot;Sorry...I need to go say good bye...to a party of 6 that was leaving&quot; He goes out side for more than 5 mins...start taking selfie with them.8:10 pm - My friends and I decided to leave the restaurant...On our way out, we told him that we are not going to dine here...and his respond was &quot;OK&quot;.This is one of the worst experience for me and my friends tonight at this place. It's so sad that this restaurant has high hope but definitely lack customer service. Visiting the ALAMO SQUARE SEAFOOD GRILL was certainly an experience to remember, but one that I never hope to repeat and would not wish upon anyone else. If you are tempted to try this restaurant for seafood...GO SOMEWHERE ELSE LIKE TADICH GRILL OR WATER BAR.To the french guy...You absolutely need to learn about manner and excellent customer service. You are so rude and disrespectful!!! I hope that this review will help others when selecting restaurants to eat in SF. I will spread the words to people that I know and let them know not to come to your restaurant!!!

We had tickets for the Sunday evening Symphony and couldn't get in to the usual, nearby haunts. My friend found this gem online. Our table was in a cozy corner overlooking Fillmore's quiet neighborhood. We enjoyed a couple of glasses of wine and the prix fixe seafood menu for less than $80. Delicious food, attentive -- but not intrusive service -- in a quiet place where conversation didn't have to be shouted across the table. A traditional feel with a country French menu.

Alamo Square Grill is our go-to for a great weekday dinner where you get quality SF cuisine without the pretension or price-gouging. The food is consistently great and we know we can count on excellent service every time. If you go on a Friday, you'll get to meet the owner Andre. He is as special as the place! The kitchen can always accommodate my wife who is a vegetarian and their beef bourguignon is not to be missed. I recently recommended it to a co-worker, who told me it was one of his favorite places too! We were raving together, so I wanted to make sure to write this review. For a warm, cozy neighborhood spot you won't be disappointed.

Grilled seafood place

This place is cozy and unlike the usual American restaurants which could have loud music, noisy patrons, noisy dishes clanging in the kitchen etc. it's a little dark but generally quiet enough to enjoy a meal in peace or enjoy a conversation without raising your voices. Make a reservation before coming as this place is popular. I had the grilled snapper with garlic parsley sauce, where I also enjoyed the grilled vegetables on the side. The grilled carrots and zucchini maintained the sweetness of the vegetables and not overly salted or peppered to cover the taste of freshness. The snapper also tasted fresh but I wished the garlic parsley butter had been warmed more before serving. I also had the floating island dessert, which was a meringue with raspberries and blueberries around it. It was delicious but I was looking forward to something more satisfying. I probably should have had the chocolate cake. The meal came up to approx $28 including tips, which was decent in my perspective.

Three of us enjoyed a wonderful Sunday night meal at this little unpretentious French bistro. We were able to make reservations, were seated immediately, and warmly welcomed. We wanted fresh seafood well-prepared, but simply prepared.We all chose Pacific coast Red Snapper from the Oregon coasts. We did not expect the prix fixe menu to be available on a Sunday night, but fortunately, it was . A perfectly dressed salad of very fresh greens was the first course. The fish was sauteed perfectly and served with a light green pepper sauce, fresh vegetables and rice. A blancmange with both caramel and chocolate sauce was beautifully presented as dessert. There was a good supply of crusty bread with olive oil with a sauce vert provided as well. I was happy that the management had not decided to watch my calories for me! The price was an unbelievable $14.75 . The wine list had many affordable options too. If I were lucky enough to live in S.F.,I would be a frequent diner here! The restaurant is handy to the Muni (22) and that night we found free parking available too..

Made it back toe the Grill for another dinner with more family. We enjoyed it so much last time we had to try it again. And they didn't disappoint us. We had two different dishes among the four of us, two off the menu and two fixed price dinners. All were very good. The fixed price meal is so reasonable at $14 for 3 courses that it's hard not to get it. The entree is slightly smaller than a regular entree but it was plenty of food for the guys and would have been too much for our lighter eaters. We went at 6:30pm which is a better time as it gets busy at 7:30pm. Service is still good with a full restaurant but better earlier.Now for some details. Wonderful service from Jackie and the staff throughout the meal. The crab cake appetizer is very good and consistent with our earlier visit. The Sea Scallop in Red Pepper Beure Blanc sauce off the menu was very good; nice spice on the scallops, and a nice sauce. Also some nice asparagus. They came with a wonderful mushroom resoto I'd have enjoyed more than the rice in our two blacked Ani Tuna dishes. The tuna was done well, not too blackened. By default tuna is cooked to pink inside but you can adjust that as you want. The fish dishes came with carrots and brussel sprouts that were also enjoyable. For dessert we had the special meringue with a caramel sauce and the vanilla creme brulee; both were well received and nice portioned. We split three among the four of us. Add a beer and bottle of wine and you're all set.This is going to become a standard stop on my visits to San Francisco, or for anyone visiting our family in the area.

What an adorable place. It is like walking into a French Bistro. And the prices are amazingly low. Where can you get a halibut dinner for $21?They had 5 fishes the night we went. You chose your fish and then chose grilled, poached, sauteed or blackened and then the sauce. It came with rice and a vegetable medley - I don't usually like vegetable medleys but this was delicious!My husband had a really nice salad before dinner and we split a dessert - floating island. It was the only disappointment - it was good not excellent.Service was great, you can BYOB, and the Uber car picks you up in minutes to take you back to your hotel.We will definitely be going back next time we are in San Francisco.

We sat in a beautiful window bench seat really enjoyed the Alamo Square Seafood Grill.

For seafood fans, there is a selection of &quot;catch of the days' and you can order them blackened, broiled, poached etc then have them finished in your favorite sauce (I had the butter/lemon) and this experience was $16! My partner loved it and we'll be back again....absolutely certain.

We ate here before an opera, and it is well-placed for the opera house, symphony hall etc.Perhaps eating so early in the evening meant that they hadn't got into the swing, but the food was a bit variable: nothing unpleasant or inedible, some dishes really nice, others very ordinary. It's probably best to order the specials; my wife had a whole fish the name of which I forget which was apparently excellent. I had swordfish from the regular menu that was just about tasteless and gave the impression of being a bit tired.

We had positive experiences 10 years ago or so as we ate there before the SF Symphony. Therefore, we were looking forward to our experience on a Monday evening as we were headed for the SF Airport. Unfortunately, our previous positive experience was not repeated. The salads were OK , but the fish dishes were not. My swordfish was a bit dry and the Pomodero sauce tasted &quot;canned&quot;. My partners Mussels smelled fishy and tasted old. The French Fries were soggy. Definitely an off night for the kitchen.

DH and I had dinner with my 2 nieces at this small restaurant on Fillmore St. I must say it was the perfect choice. Service was friendly and not rushed (which we really appreciated since we hadn't seen each other in a long time) and the food was well......just perfect! The grilled swordfish was delicious and DH had the salmon on the prix fixe menu. Now, he isn't much of a fish-eater but declared the salmon was really excellentNieces' dinner were also declared excellent. Everything was prepared with imagination with an eye toward flavor. I give this restaurant 5 stars.Only problem is parking....not many spaces in the area and a public parking lot is several blocks down the hill, i n not the nicest neighborhood.OH...and IMO, this is a small, intimate restaurant, a bistro-type of place, a casual date place. Definitely NOT a place for kids.

Started with Calamari tho the sauce had a slight curry taste....you can opt on the preparation of your fish as well as sauce.....both the salmon &amp; halibut were nicely done....finished with the cream puffs, so so. A good experience, a bit of a hike to Davies Hall.....good neighborhood spot, very good value.

We made a reservation a week before our anniversary trip to SF. I was really looking forward to some great seafood and this place didn't disappoint. But more than the food (which was great!) the service and ambiance were really awesome. Its a smaller restaurant, with maybe only 10 -15 tables at most, which led to a really intimate feeling, even between parties. I loved how, to us outsiders, it really represented the culture of the restaurant scene in the city. The menu is simple but had some great options. We ate the calamari (which is as adventurous an appetizer as my husband was willing to explore). I really wanted to try the escargot but he wasn't having it and there were simply too many items on the menu to try them all. We also had the chowder, which was good, but we probably could've split one bowl just to get a little taste of it, as by the time we got our entrees (me, the salmon, he, the ribeye) we were full. My only complaint, and this is one I have for most restaurants, is that the sides that accompanied the main course seemed to be an afterthought. I often wonder if restaurants do that on purpose because they know that it usually goes to waste. I feel that the vegetable dishes are only really superb if you order a vegetarian entree. There was a mixed veggie sautee that came with both entrees. Mixed zucchini and brussels. Mine came with an orzo/rice pilaf that was pretty bland. My husband's steak came with a big pile of fries and onion rings that were tasty but seemed a little of an insult to the rest of the dish/menu. Perhaps my expectations were too high. Bottom line, excellent job on the bread and dipping sauce, appetizers were thoughtfully made, and entree protein was delicious. If you fill up on that, you won't mind the &quot;plate filler&quot; veggie and starch. Also, the wine list looked amazing but I'm pregnant and my husband doesn't drink so we didn't get to experience it. I'm sure it would've made the meal even better (as well as the dessert menu, which we were too stuffed to even consider). If you're looking to get good seafood and experience a quintessential &quot;little restaurant in the big city,&quot; don't miss this place.

We ate here on a recent visit to SF and had a very enjoyable meal. Starters of salad and crab cake were good - the crab cakes looked over-cooked but actually were very crisp and tasty, and the salad could probably have done with some dressing, but was fine. Similarly, the main courses of fish were tasty and well-executed. Staff were friendly and the restaurant has a nice, cosy feel to it. Overall, a good experience and I recommend it.

It has been awhile since I had been at this place (and written a review), so I was pleased to find that this restaurant still rates as one of my favorites in San Francisco. It's a fish place, but I went with the daily specials. I opened with a terrific peach and heirloom tomato salad. My entree was roast pork, which was perfectly cooked. My wife and daughter had peppercorn trout and blacken salmon, respectively, and both were very happy with their meals. Prices were moderate, so this place rates as an excellent value. I'm looking forward to our next visit.

I eat here almost every time I come to San Fran (which is at least every other month). And it is very consistent in providing great food at outstanding value. Tonight I started with the New England Clam chowder and it was excellent. And for my entree, I had the blackened snapper with green peppercorn sauce. And it was very good. And it was Monday so I am having a bottle of Rose that is excellent. And a lovely dessert finished the meal. The three course meal was 14.5 because I got the early bird special. That is a value you cannot beat any where (most less San Francisco). And the BEST part of the entire experience is the fantastic service you receive. Ken is warm and welcoming host/server. And very efficient at the same time. That is not an easy combination to achieve. But by achieving it, he increases the dining experience immeasurably.

I am so glad I tried this restaurant rather than fighting the crowds at some tourist trap. The service was great. My waiter was friendly, knowledgeable and attentive. The food was really good from the apetizers to the deserts. The muscles and the escargot were fresh and delicious. I especially recommend the shrimp ceviche which provided a great mix of flavors that surprised me. I had the mahi mahi and my wife had the snapper, both prepared perfectly to our specific tastes. The waiter picked a perfect wine to compliment our meals. The side of root vegetables were really good. As for the deserts I had the flourless chocolate cake and my wife had the profiteroles. Phenomenal! At the end of the meal, the waiter offered to call us a cab which saved us the hassle of trying to figure out how to get back to the hotel. I thought the vaue was amazing and I was pleased by my bill. They could charge more although I hope that doesn't change. I really liked this place and I highly recommend it. I felt right at home. I will definitely be back.

I was wanting to find a local, non touristy restaurant to celebrate youngest son's graduation during our vacation. We had one day in San Francisco and I wanted this dinner to be memorable without breaking the bank. I reviewed everything I could find on TA, Yelp and Urbanspoon, and even asked questions on the forums. I finally chose Alamo Square even though it didn't have very many reviews, but the ones posted were definitely positive. I can absolutely say this restaurant definitely fit all I wanted; delicious food, amazing service, and a small, quaint, non-party atmosphere. We started out with ceviche and crab cakes, both of which were delicious, but the crab cakes were excellent; both sons had the tuna; I had the red snapper; and husband had the rainbow trout. All delicious. The waiter was more than happy to substitute different items on our plates; and was always there to promptly fill our glasses and ask if we needed anything. Even though it is a small place, he was the only waiter there for the evening, and you would not know it. He was even the &quot;bartender&quot; as he served our bottle of wine and beer. I was very impressed with my find, and would definitely go back if I am ever in San Francisco again.

Would not expect a seafood restaurant in this neighborhood. However, this place is a real gem. The food was excellent, and the prices are extremely reasonable. We had a 6:30pm reservation. The place was empty when we arrived. By 7:30 it was packed. The noise level was very tolerable (I hate real noisy restaurants). The service was a little slow when it got really busy. They also have some very interesting daily specials as well as fresh daily seafood (you choose the method of preparation and the sauce).. Plus there are wine specials with free corkage on Wednesday, half off bottles on Monday and half off glasses on Tuesday. We'll definite return. Suzanna was our waitress and she was a lot of fun as well as efficient.

My husband and I wanted to find a seafood restaurant that was off the beaten path ie not Fisherman's Wharf. And we were really happy we found this little gem in the Alamo Square neighbourhood. We went on a Wednesday night, which is free corkage and had booked a table for 6:15pm. It was not busy but quickly filled up within an hour. The menu is not extensive and not surprising given the name, most entrees are seafood but one of the specials that night was pork. But I would not suggest this restaurant to anyone who didn't want seafood/fish. We started with the calamari appetizer and it was very good. For the entree I had the blackened snapper and my husband had the swordfish. The fish was cooked perfectly and nicely seasoned -just enough spices. The mixed grilled vegetables and rice were a nice complement. We topped it off by sharing a tiramisu and were totally happy with our meal and it was a fantastic price to boot. Highly recommend and we would definitely return when visiting San Francisco

We recently had a convention in San Francisco and set out to take some clients to a restaurant that was small and in a quiet neighborhood off of the main path. WE FOUND IT. Alamo Square Seafood Grill was the best restaurant. Initially we stunned the employees when six of us walked in and they didn't have our reservation (Open Table didn't make it through for some reason). It took a little bit to seat us but once we did, it was perfect. Everyone had something different and they each raved about their food. Great atmosphere and service too!

We loved the quirky ambiance, with piles all around the wall seating, nice art, low light. The seasoned vegetables were ridiculously good, the trout small but delectable, but the calamari stole the show. Very nice waiter, accommodated us and our messy baby. I would have liked a wider variety of fish on the menu and our bowl of chowder seemed like 1/2 a bowl, but still a nice time.

This is really a local neighborhood restaurant, The night we were their, it was quite busy the night we went. We picked our appetizers before we started to look at the dinner menu. Good Thing, otherwise we woould probably still be waiting for our food. We waited over 15 minutes between when our empty appetizer plates were taken away until we were served our entrees. Our small water glasses were not refilled until we had finished dinner. While it is known for its seafood, the best value on the menu was the Steak and the Chicken dishes. My risotto did not have the creaminess one would usually get, but the other people had delicious starches on their plates. The prices are good, the food was good, but not great. I could hear conservations from across the room. It was quite noisy most of the time we were there. With only 2 waiters in the restaurant, it was probably not enough for the business that night.

Our party of six was pleasantly surprised by the high quality and flavorful taste of every entree and appetizer. The restaurant is small but the single server did an excellent job of getting the orders correct and to the table as soon as possible. Two servers probably would have been beneficial but then the prices would most likely be higher. Be patient and enjoy an excellent dining experience. A must try eatery!

A must-visit restaurant whenever I'm in town. A small dining area with big time entrees. The fish entrees have always been moist and flavorful. Although &quot;seafood&quot; is in their name, I've enjoyed extremely well prepared steak and chicken dishes. If your on a strict budget, inquire about their diner specials from 5:30pm to (I think) 7pm. Make a reservation and enjoy the best of San Francisco.

This may be the best value in San Francisco. I started with the salad, which was dressed perfectly. My main course was the blackened trout. Delicious. Perfectly cooked and seasoned.

I went there with two other guys an a sunday evening. We had a table reservation but there were enough free tables for people without a reseration. The service was made by only one guy who was not so much too friendly like they are usualy in us - restaurants and he made his job really good.The food was exzellent. Sure, there are better restaurants but not in the same or close by price categories. The serving sizes especially the appetizers were very good. We had fried calamari, escargots and and a salad with schrimp and avocado and everbody was surprised at the good taste and the serving-sizes.The interior is plainly and not overloaded with decoration.It is a very nice small restaurant to have real good food and a cozy evening with friends.

We were jet lagged and worn out from our first day in San Francisco. We wanted seafood, but didn't want to fight the crowds at Fisherman's Wharf nor deal with the long waits on North Beach. We did a little research and found this restaurant, a 5 minute cab ride from our hotel.This is a small restaurant, with tasteful wine-centric decorations and intimate seating. It has a pretty small menu featuring 5 different fishes, cooked however you choose and with whatever topping you choose.Our table had blackened Red Snapper, Mussels w/chorizo and the special of bay scallops, caulifornia risotto and asparagus. All we cooked to perfection and simply wonderful!!!Our service was excellent and fun.We had great meals and great times here at the Alamo. Definitely a do-over!!!!

The service was great and the food was even better. We both had the prix fixe dinner the night we dined here. The first course was your choice of either a dinner salad or celery soup. My husband's salad was a simple bowl of mixed greens, very fresh with a tasty balsamic dressing. My cream soup was brilliant. Next we had the main course, consisting of grilled salmon and mixed veggies with rice. Delicious. Lastly, we were treated to a dessert of bread pudding. I am finicky about my bread pudding, having grown up on my father's recipe, and I have to say that this bread pudding was excellent. You are probably thinking that this incredible meal must have cost us and arm and a leg, but no...we had all that for just $14.50 apiece! We did not drink any alcohol with our meal, but it looked like they had an extensive wine list. Don't miss out on this little neighborhood restaurant. We were hoping to return for another meal but our wanderings kept us from being able to make it back there. Next trip to SF, we will surely return!

We ate at the Alamo Sqaure Seafood Grill on New Year's Eve. It was a prix fix menu but it was wonderful. Reasonable portions, great presentation and wonderful service. I recommend this place. The concierge at our hotel said he had never heard of it when I inquired as to how far away it was. He should know about this place. It is very unassuming in appearance but definitely has good food. The only thing that could use some work is the wine list.

We chose this restaurant because we were renting an apartment near Alamo Square but we'd gladly travel the length of SF to eat here again. Most of us chose the prix fixe menu of blackened salmon served with sauteed vegs (brussels sprouts, unique squashes and carrots) which was accompanied by lobster bisque or field greens and followed by (only disappointment of the evening - chocolate souffle which was leaden but flavorful). One in our party had the special of the day - filet mignon with pancetta and yukon gold potatoes and grilled asparagus. This meal was (if possible), more amazing that the salmon. Portions were generous and prices made this a comparatively economical choice. On wednesdays, you can bring your own wine and there is no corkage for up to 2 bottles if 2 entrees are ordered. The service was great until the restaurant began filling up. The waiter/host was assisted by the sous chef but was clearly taxed. We would highly recommend this restaurant and think the locals have a gem in their midst.

Had Christmas Eve Dinner here with a friend. Chose ASSG due to the TripAdvisor reviews. We were disappointed. We had the Prix Fixe 3 course meal. All courses were good. I had a mushroom bisque and scallops entree. The bisque was delicious and the scallops were good. The third course was a dessert. We waited for an hour after our entrees dishes were cleared, and the staff had yet not taken our order for this course. We felt we were being ignored as the tables around us were receiving attention, where we were not. Finally I flagged down a server, who did apologize and offered us complimentary wine. Once our desserts were brought out, they were both good, but we were the last party in the restaurant, having been ignored through the latter part of our meal. Definitely not worth a trip from Union Square based upon the lousy service. We would have been better off not making the trek to Alamo Square.

We have visited Alamo Square Seafood Grill several times over the past couple of years, and it is consistently excellent. This is a small neighborhood restaurant, charming and comfortable, with friendly service and excellent food. They specialize in seafood, with some wonderful appetizers and great seafood entrees, as well as fabulous desserts. We eat healthy, so we ordered our salmon grilled without any of the several sauces they offer as options, and it was tender and delicious, just superb, served with rice and vegetables. They write the day's specials on two chalkboards, one on each side of the dining room, but they also offer a full menu. If you order fish, you can choose the method of cooking and the sauce... made to order! For dessert, the flourless chocolate cake is to die for, but they offer several other desserts for non-chocolate lovers. Be sure to make a reservation, as they can get busy.

Two of my adult children and I dined here last night, based on the glowing TA reviews, and we were not disappointed. This is a low-key neighborhood seafood charmer that blends innovative seafood preparation with laid-back service. We had a subtle celery and fennel soup, seared scallops with asparagus and wild mushrooms, grilled snapper beurre blanc and a grilled ahi tuna bernaise. We found the ordering process for the catch of the day by preparation and sauce type a user friendly way of simplifying the menu. Nice, small, reasonably priced wine list (we had a Cote du Rhone blanc for $30). Would come back again in a heartbeat.

Made it back toe the Grill for another dinner with more family. We enjoyed it so much last time we had to try it again. And they didn't disappoint us. We had two different dishes among the four of us, two off the menu and two fixed price dinners. All were very good. The fixed price meal is so reasonable at $14 for 3 courses that it's hard not to get it. The entree is slightly smaller than a regular entree but it was plenty of food for the guys and would have been too much for our lighter eaters. We went at 6:30pm which is a better time as it gets busy at 7:30pm. Service is still good with a full restaurant but better earlier.Now for some details. Wonderful service from Jackie and the staff throughout the meal. The crab cake appetizer is very good and consistent with our earlier visit. The Sea Scallop in Red Pepper Beure Blanc sauce off the menu was very good; nice spice on the scallops, and a nice sauce. Also some nice asparagus. They came with a wonderful mushroom resoto I'd have enjoyed more than the rice in our two blacked Ani Tuna dishes. The tuna was done well, not too blackened. By default tuna is cooked to pink inside but you can adjust that as you want. The fish dishes came with carrots and brussel sprouts that were also enjoyable. For dessert we had the special meringue with a caramel sauce and the vanilla creme brulee; both were well received and nice portioned. We split three among the four of us. Add a beer and bottle of wine and you're all set.This is going to become a standard stop on my visits to San Francisco, or for anyone visiting our family in the area.

We just had an early dinner at Alamo Square Seafood Grill. We lucked out, there were 3 of us and arriving at 5:30pm we got their only available table -reservations are a must. Their dinner menu is only one page of entrees, but they must know what they do well and they stick with it. We were amazed that the prices were very reasonable for San Francisco, and when we tasted our food all 3 of use were totally delighted! My husband had one of the specials: Grilled Scallops. There were 4 large scallops, served with fresh asparagus and potatoes. My son had seared Ahi with garlic/parsley butter, served with rice and grilled vegetables. I had grilled salmon with provencale sauce, the flavors of the tomatoes, olives and capers were perfectly balanced, and the grilled vegetables were perfectly prepared. And their french bread with olive oil/basil/parsley is an awesome starter! Great dinner with wonderfully fresh ingredients. Keep it coming!

Top notch food, especially fresh fish as main course and all appetizers. We had calimari, mussels and totally crab, crab cakes and heirloom tomato salad as appetizers - all large portions and great. Main courses of red snapper in butter sauce, and scallop dish were best choices of the four dinners. Good selection of wines at reasonable price. Desserts, both creme brulee and no-flour chocolate cake were outstanding.Prices were very fair, with value for money. Nice ambiance, off the main tourist path. Definitely patronized by locals.

Went to Alamo Square Seafood restaurant on our visit to San Francisco. It is a nice little neighborhood restaurant in San Francisco. All the dishes were very good and reasonably priced. We went on a Monday because they had wines half priced. It was crowded and there was only one waiter. We were not in a hurry so it did not bother us. The waiter did a good job considering he had at 10 tables to serve. Would recommend the restaurant.

We wanted great seafood so we came to Trip Advisor and quickly settled on this spot based on the rave reviews. While it was a nice little spot with solid food, there was nothing in the food or service to merit the raves on here. If, like us, you have only a few meals in town, this probably shouldn't make the list. We had the mussels. Then one of us had the prix fixe and one the blackened snapper. No complaints really, except that the merengue dessert with the prix fixe was inedible. But nothing was better than a solid seafood restaurant in any other place or even a good meal you cook at home, and nothing was a must-have. The ambiance was cozy and friendly - the tables are so small and close that you inevitably talk to those around you.

A friend recommend this little restaurant to me, right next to Alamo square in San fran. I was staying in the hotel Carlton near union square, loads of touristy restaurants in that area, so I jumped in a taxi, only cost $10 with tip, so really local.Quite a small place, mainly local diners. The girl who served us was really nice, I had the crab cakes, all home made proper food, the wife had roasted cauliflower soup, my word was it good, just so tasty. Had seared tuna and red snapper for main, followed by an incredible apple bread pudding.Iv been to some top end restaurants in my time, but for pure food. &amp; taste it's up there. Please trust me, it's really good value, and the food is top end.Jonathan. X

Excellent service, good food. Went on Free corkage Wednesdays and brought a nice bottle of wine that we had picked up in Monterey. Service was friendly and the atmosphere was comfortable. Seafood was good. Would go again when in San Francisco. Online Reservations worked excellent.

I am loathed to write a review saying I much we enjoyed this place, as I want to keep it a secret all to myself.For San Francisco, it's sensationally good value given the quality of the food and the atmosphere. The enthusiastic French owner waits the tables which adds a touch of realism (that happens in France all the time) and they have some great specials like half price wine list on Mondays and free corkage on Tuesdays.Bottom line is that we ate like kings in a wonderful intimate romantic atmosphere and were pleasantly surprised by the bill. We will be back, no question.

Average at best, patchy, not all bad. Mussels were great!

Locals love it...and for good reason...it's cozy, fire burning in the welcoming hearth, 'everyone knows your name', etc. BUT as visitors to the region, using TA as our guide? I'll be VERY direct: the food 1st: beautifully prepared mussels served in a HOT pot, lovely spicy pesto dip with the complimentary crusty 'bread for the table' were the high points of the meal. AND the pomme frites &amp; onion ring sides were terrific!Our other 3 dishes were not up to the mark: both fish dishes were overdone and tending to dryness. My steak, ordered medium RARE was served medium well: and it was skinny / thin (1/2 inch thick?). Service was patchy with one overworked tireless server tending to the entire room. Decoration is fine / clean &amp; tidy.The neighbourhood with the 'painted ladies' only a few 100 m away, and the Hayes district on our walking route after the meal was interesting, and we were happy we made the journey to the Alamo Square Seafood Grill.With 'seafood' in the NAME, one might expect a higher STANDARD?'Grill' suggests some expertise at cooking a steak?Not all bad, average at best:3 circles for everything but the 'value: just over a C note ('Uncle Ben' ),after the BYO wine charge and a gratuity, so it's not a bon marche: 2 circles there.Perhaps an early diner (pre 7pm) from the neighbourhood ordering the daily 3 course 'special' at under 20 bucks feels differently, but that's our experience.

A good local restaurant serving very tasty seafood and steak at a reasonable price.

On our three night stay in SF we decided to visit this restaurant based on TA reviews. We were not disappointed.It is very much a &quot;local restaurant&quot;, the antithesis of larger and chain restaurants. The atmosphere is low key, laid back, intimate and warm.The menu is not the most extensive you will find, but it covers most bases.Our order included fried calamari to start which had a delicious crispy coating, blackened red snapper with bernaise sauce and the Rib-eye steak, all of which were well cooked and very enjoyable.The wine list was good, and the wines that we ordered by the glass were well above average.The total bill including wine and a tip was $95. A bit pricey, but we felt that the price was a fair representation of the quality of the food. I'm sure the set menu served earlier in the evening is very good value.

This charming neighborhood restaurant was the most memorable of all in our week's stay in San Francisco. We were delighted with this find, off the beaten path with top shelf food, a charming atmosphere, and personal interaction with the owner, who casually spoke with people in French all about the restaurant. The fresh trout &amp; snapper choices from the menu were excellent, as was the ribeye. Unique and flavorful olive oil served with the bread before dinner. A great find!

This was our first time in San Fran, so we made a quick stop at the painted ladies with the obligatory photo op, and then ran through the pouring rain to the Alamo Square Seafood Grill.It was a Sunday evening, and we had made reservations in advance. We were promptely seated in a corner table which we quite liked. The interior is cozy as many others have described and the atmosphere is very casual and relaxes.That night, there was only one waitress on staff so the service was slow, yet polite, which worked out great for us as we don't like being rushed.The food was great starting by the baguette with the delicious pesto oil. For appetizers we had the crab cakes and the salmon tartar. They were both fabulous. Great taste, great presentation. For mains we had ahi tuna for my wife, and rib eye steak for myself. Again, everything tasted delicious, and we were quite happy overall.The wine list is a bit basic, but I guess it goes with the simple bistro fare theme.My wife and i truly enjoyed this restaurant and would highly recommend it to foodie type tourists.

We took a girls trip to San Fran and really didn't know what to expect when it came to Grill. From the outside it looked unassuming but once inside this cozy spot you knew the food had to be good. We were served warm bread but the best part was the dip...OMG, it was so good I asked for the recipe. I'm a true lover of fish (and not just bcuz I'm a Pisces) I ordered from the Prix Fix menu but had my Salmon blackened...it was incredible! My only suggestion would be to make reservations...it's a small spot and many people turned around because of the wait and the limited serving staff. All in all, I would definitely recommend ASSG.

We took a bus to the restaurant from downtown San Francisco because it was raining that evening. The restaurant was fairly empty with only two tables filled. We sat wherever we wanted (in a corner on a padded bench with a table) and had the menu of the day special ($15 for soup or salad, tuna entree and dessert). It was fantastic! The menu of the day is only available from 5-7 pm so be sure to get there early. You also should make reservations so the restaurant is expecting you.

Five of us had dinner at the Alamo Square Seafood Grill based on the reviews in TA. We were not disappointed. The restaurant offers a pleasant neighborhood bistro ambience, with good seafood at a moderate price. I had the Mediterranean fish soup and it was excellent. And on Monday nights the wine is half price, so you gotta love the whole deal.

Everything about our experience here was wonderful. We walked in (with reservations) and were immediately taken to a cute table in the corner for two and greeted by our waiter. It was a Wednesday so we took advantage of the no corking fee and brought our own wine. The food was delicious from the freshly fried calamari to the perfectly seared ahi tuna and red snapper. Everything was so fresh and delicious. Even the desert was amazing. We were also pleasantly surprised with our bill being as low as it was for a fabulous romantic eventing out!!!

I chose this restaurant because of the good reviews. We had reservations for 7:30, but came in more than an hour early and were seated right away (good thing, the restaurant was packed within an hour). The menu included several fish dishes prepared different ways with an assortment of sauces. Meat dishes were available also.The restaurant is small and difficult to move about when busy, but the food was excellent. I highly recommend it for a romantic dinner.I did give a 3-star rating for service. There was only one server (I think he was the owner) for our Monday night dinner. Service was a little slow, but the food made up for it. I'm looking forward to going back the next time I'm in San Francisco.

After being recommended this restaurant twice in one week, I knew I had to try this place. Both recommendations came with rave reviews for the prix fixe menu, given a limited budget. The prix fixe menu, available 5:30 until 7, comes with soup or salad, the chef's entree of the day, and the dessert of the day.My boyfriend and I both ordered the prix fixe menu. The bread came with an excellent dipping sauce, tasted like butter and garlic and parsley. The bread was nothing special, but that was the only food item that wasn't amazing. My salad was pretty normal and his zucchini curry soup was fantastic. The entree, salmon with a Bearnaise sauce, was excellent. Extremely fresh with a flavorful sauce. Even the rice and steamed veggies were excellent! Dessert was a &quot;floating island,&quot; or meringue in custard. I had never had meringue quite like it but it was delicious. Also, my boyfriend was able to enjoy a Krusovice, a Czech beer he hadn't been able to find since Prague, another factor that will be sure to ensure our return to this restaurant!The restaurant also has a great ambiance. Dimly lit and very romantic, everything is very nicely designed. It's a small restaurant and the waitresses were friendly. The food came quickly, but when the restaurant filled up service did slow down a bit. Certainly not a bad place to have to wait a little while though!

We wanted somewhere that served good fish on our last night in San Francisco and we found this place after looking on trip advisor. It is fantastic, I can't recommend it highly enough. It's in a neighbourhood location but was a very short taxi drive from our hotel. Because of it's location it seems to have more local custom than from tourists which can only be a good thing. We went on a Wednesday night when they offer free corkage on BYO wine which was a good deal. Our waiter was friendly and happy to answer all questions that we had about the food and San Fran in general. The menu is small, essentially there are 4 fish of the day and you can choose how it is cooked and what sauce you have with it. That's my kind of food; simple and well done. There were several inventive specials as well which turned out to be delicious. We couldn't resist dessert which was an excellent creme brulee and profiteroles with an ice cream filling instead of the traditional cream. Delicious.The ambience in the restaurant was great even though it was quiet. Service was brilliant and overall the whole experience was brilliant. It was the only thing that made me want to return to San Fran - go go go!

Best meal of our San Francisco trip

We needed a restaurant within walking distance of our bed and breakfast, but this turned out to be the best meal of our week-long San Francisco visit. Calamari and crab cake appetizers were light and flavorful. Each of the four of us had a different entre, and they were all excellent. The various sauces were light complements without overpowering the perfectly cooked fish (salmon, cod, mahi mahi) of each dish. Whether the side was rice, risotto, or potato, it was excellent; vegetables were steamed or sauteed just right. The bouillabaisse could be the best I've eaten. We had a late meal, but the early evening three-course prix fixe for about $15 looked like an incredible deal. Don't be afraid if there isn't a typical San Francisco long wait for a table, just be thankful. We loved the good service and intimacy of this cozy restaurant that was much better than others where we waited over an hour earlier in the week. Prices were great, especially for a meal of this caliber - under $100 with appetizers and tip (no alcohol) for four adults. They offer an extensive beer and wine selection or BYO.

Around the corner from Alamo Square and the famous &quot;Painted Ladies&quot; Victorian homes, this neighborhood restaurant has some delicious sea food dishes. The night that we dined there, it was very quiet so the service was outstanding. The dining room was somewhat spartan with almost no ambience, however, the meal more than made up for it. Their pear tart dessert was wonderful.

For my birthday, my boyfriend offered to take me to any restaurant of my choosing, i.e.: Gary Danko, Michael Minna or Kokkari. Without hesitation I yelped, &quot;Alamo Square!!!!&quot; I absolutely adore this place! I live about a block away and mostly go on Wednesday nights, when they have a no corkage BYOB. This neighborhood gem has the food of a four star restaurant along with a delightful and friendly staff and insanely affordable prices. BTW, my birthday dinner... Mussels w/frites, a beautiful seasonal salad, perfectly roasted Mahi Mahi w/teardrop tomatoes, broccoli rabe and a fresh corn and mashed potato mix and ending with a pear tartine.

Visiting my son and family in San Francisco. They said this place was very good and they were right. Got dinner which included salad or soup. I got salad which was very fresh, entree which was blackened snapper and dessert which was bread pudding. Fresh vegetables served with entree were spinach, brussel sprouts, carrots, summer and winter squash all sauteed together. Everything was excellent. Only one server but she worked very hard and was very pleasant. Would highly recommend especially on Wednesday nights when there is no corkage fee.

The place is a hole-in-the-wall and it's off the beaten track but it serves up some of the best steak and seafood in the City at non-City prices. The service isn't always the best but the food is worth the wait. Great selection of wines and if you're lucky, Andre, the owner, will be there and help you order the best combination of fish, how it should be cooked, and what sauce would go best with it.
