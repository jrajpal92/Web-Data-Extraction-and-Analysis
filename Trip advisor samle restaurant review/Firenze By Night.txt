If you are going to Little Italy to grab some Italian food, stay off the main drag (Columbus) and try the family-owned places on the side streets. Our hotel concierge recommended Firenze by Night and it did not disappoint. The owner met us at the door and made us feel at home. Our server was old-school Italian and really went the extra mile to make our family feel welcome. Make sure to call ahead for reservations.Dan's Travel Tip #1: Make sure to try the Prosciutto &amp; Melon.

We were in love with this place! The employees were all Italian and knew their stuff, in fact I had my waiter order for me! Food was so good, definitely not like chain Italian restaurants!! Prices were reasonable! The atmosphere made you feel like you were back in time and exactly how you would picture a family owned, real-deal Italian place to be! I especially loved the celebrity wall!

I have been to this restaurant several times and the food has been good overall, but not impressive. The pasta is good- pasta dishes would be my choice over some of the other dishes we have tried. Even the specials have not been as good as the basic pasta dishes. Seafood dishes have been disappointing considering the proximity of fresh seafood markets.

This restaurant has a cozy atmosphere. I was impressed with the prompt service and appreciated the nice touch of our server lighting the candle lamps when we sat down. Our food arrived promptly, which was impressive, since we had a good-sized party. I enjoyed my ravioli and wish we would have had time to stay for dessert.

This storefront restaurant is located on the fringes of Chinatown and North Beach. A friend had recommended it. What a find! The Italian food was outstanding, and the service excellent. There was an informal atmosphere about the restaurant, but they were serious about their food. The sauces in particular were excellent, as were the specials of the day. For the City, we thought that the prices were very reasonable.

I have been to Firenze by Night on several occasions with family and friends and each time was so glad I went back. One time, while in SF on business, my colleagues and I decided to stop in without a reservation and the host recognized me, seated us (table of 6) right away and we had a magnificent time. The food is tremendous, the service friendly and personable and the prices quite reasonable. Try Firenze by Night, you will be so glad you did!

My husband and I took his coworker here upon the recommendation of a friend back home and a local we met the night before. I was expecting a lot, but the meal was just fair. I wish I had ordered one of their award winning dishes. The Ravioli Della Mamma was ok, but the coworker we dined with ordered a nightly seafood special and really enjoyed it. The service was wonderful. The atmosphere was genuine and charming.

We went to this restaurant for dinner for my Italian boyfriend's father who just turned 83. I had the cannelloni stuffed wth chicken and prosciutto. Dad had the risotto and mom had the veal wth pesto. We had antipasto platter beforehand and shared 2 tartufo di chocolate. Mmm. Outstanding service. Would love to eat here every night if I lived here!

Once again Trip Advisors steered us right! We made our trek to Firenze right here in North Beach. The wine selection is very good and we settled on a nice Chianti Classico. We ordered the Prosceitto and Melon which was a nice combination and a very cool appetizer on this humid evening. I ordered the papperadelli toscana and my wife the gnocchi. Every bit was perfect! The waiter was excellent the menu awesome and the ambience just like Italy. A great North Beach Italian night!

My husband and I had a great dinner here while enjoying a short stay in San Francisco. We had mussels &amp; clams marinara and stuffed mushrooms as appetizers - the shellfish were great but the mushrooms, while flavorful, were a bit oily. Shared gnocchi and farfalle with rabbit for dinner - both were served steaming hot and full of fresh pasta. Definitely the best gnocchi both of us have ever had. The service was really lovely and we never felt rushed. Cozy, unpretentious little place. We really enjoyed our meal here.

Fantastic Italian Restaurant in North Beach of San Francisco. Make reservations as this place is excellent and gets busy. Quality of food is fantastic. We had Italian sausage stuffed mushrooms and carpaccio as appetizers. The stuffed mushrooms were better of the two. For entree we had their famous gnocchi and veal scallopini all a romana, both great. Finished dinner with dessert, cappuccino, and a shot of grappa. Waiter was very friendly and responsive to us. Would go back here again with every visit to San Francisco.

Firenze By Night is in the heart of North Beach (Columbus and Stockton)...a lively and diverse neighborhood (many young Silicon Valley tech people live there). The restaurant is inconspicuously located in the middle of the block. Mostly patronized by locals, the food and service are wonderful. Suggestions: try the snails (the Italian version) and sit in the bar area as it's quieter. And, desserts are awesome. Dinner for three with a $50 bottle of wine (and a martini) and tip was a bit over $200 (and we had a lot of food!).

If you are looking for great Italian food, reasonable ambiance in a non tourist environment at a reasonable price this place is perfect for you. Located in North Beach and easy to find. We started with procutto and melon and a mozzarella and tomato salad. Both were very good. Eggplant for Sally and pasta bolognese for me. Very good. Wine prices were reasonable and we promised ourselves to return the next time we are in San Francisco.

A friend told me this was the best Italian she's ever had! So we decided we'd give it a go when we came into town. The pasta was delicious AND homemade. I had a full order of rabbit tagliatelle while my husband had a half order. He also had braised lamb shank which was also fabulous. We arrived at for our reservation a few minutes early and sat at the bar. The bartender was friendly, as was Paolo, the manager. If you want good Italian in SanFran.....go!!

We were not disappointed in our first visit to this restaurant. We wanted Italian, and we got Italian. The portions were generous, and the food arrived steaming hot and delicious.

I now understand why this restaurant gets so many high reviews on Google. This place is great!If you are looking for good food, good service, good prices, and a very pleasant atmosphere, Firenze by Night is the place to go.I came here with my niece on a Saturday night, and we truly had a lovely evening. It has a good selection of Italian dishes and seafood. I ordered the Petrale seafood special. It was delicious. I know I need to return to taste some of the many pasta dishes that are on their menu.The restaurant also gets one extra star for the clean, white tablecloth that was on the table. I notice detail, and I appreciate this refinement. I also noticed that many of the other restaurants in North Beach did not have tablecloths; they were not as refined and too touristy.As for suggestions: 1. Parking is difficult - you may want to take a taxi or Uber over to the restaurant. 2. They open at 5:00 pm - I suggest you get there early as the tables fill up very fast. 3. Try walking around the neighborhood (Little Italy/North Beach) after dinner. Find an Italian pastry shop or an Italian gelato shop.

Sought out this place while on a recent family vacation in town and it was definitely worth seeking out.Arrived with no reservation about 8pm on a Monday and were seating with essentially no wait. Restaurant looks like a classic out of the 50's (which I mean as a compliment), with nice Italian murals on the walls and old wine bottles in wicker and low lighting; looks like it has been in business a long time. The staff seems to be all from the Old Country and our experience felt very fun and authentically Italian. Our waiter was very friendly and professional and I felt comfortable using my menu-level Italian. Our two teenage children really enjoyed their choices even though they were a bit outside their range of experience (our son tried the capon).Based on other reviews I had to try the gnocchi. Literally the best gnocchi I have ever had in my life! It says &quot;award winning&quot; on the menu and I can see why. Don't miss it.Some other tourists in the place but also some obvious locals for whom this seems to be a Special Spot. Deservedly so.

For San Fransisco it was a great find and the prices were very good, as we found a lot of restaurants very expensive and we live near London, I highly recommend everything, but the special hand made Gnocchi was exceptional as were the specials, go go go to this restaurant you will not be disappointed , thank you Firenze for our fabulous meals and great service you made both nights very special and to all the staff

This was recommended by our hotel concierge. What a great choice! The food was delicious - fresh and authentic and perfect. The service was excellent and everyone was friendly. The only thing holding me back from 5 stars was the noise level - very loud! We got stuck sitting behind someone who clearly doesn't eat out much and thought he had to shout to impress his friends. The whole place was loud, but that was not to take away from the food and service.

The atmosphere was good with Italian waiters over-playing Italian waiters. The veal dished were made by old meat and tasted as if they had been in the garbage can for ages, The Antipestos were acceptable but not great. I strongly advice you never to go to this turist trap. The 4,5 point rating must have written by the resturant people themselves. I visited the place with friends from Italy and they were visibly embarrased.

We ate at Firenze 20 years ago bc someone recommended that it was great traditional food with that real Italian family ambiance with the family service. And it was and still is. We have been back 4 times since in the past years and this past July 2016, it still delivers the same wonderful food with the wonderful people. and its not touristy. This time we had the Porterhouse steak with our pasta order of chicken spinach fettuccine and the steak was as good as one in a real steakhouse. The pasta delicious as usual. Can't beat this place. Should try the gnocchi. It's the best.

This restaurant certainly doesn't need another great review but I could find no fault. From the lovely bartender that made a perfect negroni to the spot on server we felt that we were in great hands. We started with the snails that were delicious. The focaccia was perfect to sop up the butter and not over the top garlic. I had the gnocchi and my husband had the veal special. Everything was great. Finished off our wine ( which was an Italian super Tuscan recommended by the bartender) with some biscotti. Very affordable and we will definitely return.

Made a same day reservation (thankfully) for dinner after the 6pm Beach Blanket Babylon performanceGot there early (was a 2 hour wait without a reservation by the time we arrived) so enjoyed a glass of wine at the bar. The bartender was very engaging and it gave us an opportunity to see why we made the right choice - the aroma of the food, the bustling atmosphere, and the many handshakes and hugs with the owners from guests leaving only got my tastebuds fired up.We each had an appetizer (I had the sausage stuffed mushroom) and the flavour and portion size was perfect.I had the roasted quail with Barolo sauce and it was exquisite. Words cannot describe how flavourful this dish was. My wife had the ravioli and the pasta &amp; sauce had that handmade texture and flavour. Our son had a veal with a pesto sauce and it was as great as it was unique.Service was attentive with a fun server from Sicily - yes, that authentic.Good value was on point especially for the quality.This place is a must go to and we would not hesitate to return.

Dinner with some long-lost friends in early July, a fantastic experience. The restaurant is in a fun part of town, where Chinatown is spilling into North Beach, mixing their respective vibes (restaurants, stores, and so on) in a really fun way. We started with an appetizer and wonderful bottle of wine, with a sparkling water and bread basket. Two at the table went with the Spinach Alfredo (great choice) and I had the very best Gnocchi of my life (made on-site and created to perfection). Generous portions will leave you full, keep room for dessert if you can. One at my table was an old friend of the restaurant's (another chef in San Francisco) and we were treated to complimentary Cannoli. It. Was. Phenomenal. (I once went on a self-guided &quot;Cannoli tour&quot; of Boston's North End, and this was better than all of them).Reservations are a good idea, particularly on busy weekend nights. Budget enough time to be leisurely and really enjoy the meal (and the company you bring with you). It's an easy mile-walk to the Pier-area, and I felt perfectly safe doing it around 9 on a Saturday night, if you're looking for something to do after dinner (and want to walk off some of the delicious carbs!).In conclusion : I highly recommend.

Decided to go out to dinner before the fireworks so no reservation. Waited about 15 mins and seated at a table for two by the kitchen...smelled great. Staff all speak Italian, so English was a second language. With a nice glass of red wine and delicious bread, we ordered veal Milan and pasta in Rabbit sauce. Both were delicious. Dinner was not cheap, $92 with tip, but it was excellent. Wouldn't bring small kids since the food is all prepared fresh do it takes a while. Try it and I believe you will like it.

Traditional Italian food in a nice setting. Crowded restaurant, with tables really close together. Open for dinner. Definitely make a reservation. The gnocchi were top shelf, and the linguini buon gusto were a nice surprise. The tiramisu was very good. I think the tomato mozzarella salad could have had a more flavorful tomato. The host was nice, and service was really good. We never heard the specials though. Wine is reasonably priced, with bottles around $40 per bottle. Budget about $40 per person for three courses. Full bar. I'd go back.

This was recommended by the hotel. We arrived and there was a wait and we chose to eat at the bar. This turned out to be a really good decision.

The gnocchi was incredible. The seafood special was very special indeed. We travel extensively, and this was one of the very best meals we have had. Highly recommend this beautiful restaurant.

After seeing this restaurant highlighted on our hotel room's advertising channel for local sightseeing we decided to try it. My wife had her doubts about the gnocchi but it was like many others have described: pillows of heaven with a cream based tomato sauce that allowed the gnocchi to be the star of the dish while perfectly complimenting it. I had a seafood linguini special which truly was special with properly cooked calamari, muscles, clams, scallops and shrimp throughout. And unlike some restaurants that skimp on each of the seafood options, there was plenty of each to share and seek out to try again. The dessert was tastey though the entrees easily stole the show. The service was good though if you aren't used to Italian service (which is more about letting you enjoy the meal then being at your elbow at every turn) you may find it a bit slow. My wife particularly enjoyed the Italian accents of all the wait staff. The atmosphere feels inviting but formal with candles at each table and origami made out of your napkin. Definitely would go back when in town again!

My family came here for dinner after attending Beach Blanket Babylon. We were hoping for a really authentic Italian dinner. We were very disappointed. The food was quite ordinary...even bland.

We will not be back.

With a huge choice of italian restaurants in North Beach area, Italian it was going to be! We chose Firenze as it looked vibrant and full inside with lots of happy faces. Lucky there was room for two. There were a few groups that increased the noise levels but i don't mind that. Service was very quick and efficient and our drinks arrived promptly. i had my heart set on steak and had pictured a large Bistecca alla Fiorentina, Lucky this was on the menu but it confused me by calling it a Porterhouse. I ordered it anyway. It was indeed a Fiorentina! A huge strapping size that covered the plate. It was cooked as requested and was rather tasty. Veggies on the side were a bit bland but the steak was just wehat the doctor ordered. My husband had my second choice - the paparadelle with rabbit. At $20, this is a winner alright! The dish was cooked perfectly, well seasoned and tasty and a decent portion size. Excelent value for money.

I was travelling with a work group and we were referred to Firenze by Night by a local bartender. We are glad we took his advice. This was the perfect place and reminded us of a good Italian Restaurant in South Philadelphia. The atmosphere is festive, the staff is overly friendly, and the food was outstanding. Their specials for the night were good and the can't-miss dish is gnocchi. I look forward to going back and trying it again. It's that good! Also, the waiter was very friendly and the wine list is extensive. It's worth the time while you are in San Francisco.

An excellent experience from start to finish. We started with a warm spinach salad with bacon bits and pine nuts in a brandy dressing. My wife ordered the petrale sole special. The sole just about covered the whole plate with roasted potatoes and string beans and carrots tucked around the edges. The sole is probably the best piece of fish we've ever ate. It literally melted in the mouth. It was superb. I ordered the seafood and linguine in marinara sauce special. It was full of clams, mussels, shrimp, calimari and fish. Everything was cooked to perfection and tasted wonderful. Our server was very friendly, helpful and quick. The restaurant is comfortable and nicly decorated. It really doesn't get better than this. Reservations are recommended.

We were enjoying a lovely glass of wine in a bar called Belle Cora in Green Street and asked for a restaurant recommendation, preferably Italian. The friendly barman directed us to Firenze by Night, and it was certainly worth it. Great service, very friendly and open, beautiful food with lots of flavour (althoughI would avoid the linguine with mussels, although it was very nice, it lacked taste). The risotto was 'to die for' and the antipasto was just delicious. We wanted a nice wine, good food, and great service and nothing over the top. Firenze delivered it all and then some. I would go back tomorrow. Loved it.

This gem is on the south side of the North Beach area adjacent to the China Town line. If the concierge had not sent me here, I would probably have walked right by, trying to get further into the North Beach Italian feel. That would have been a mistake. I showed up a bit early, 6:30 with a reservation, but there were only two other families in the place and it was a Saturday night. I thought about cancelling, but it just smelled right. I ordered a nice Brunello and the Papparadelle with rabbit ragu. First off, the papparadelle was fresh, hand made pasta with just the right amount of ragu, a thin drizzle of olive oil, and a dusting a Parmaggiano Reggiano. Wow. It was a proper pasta starter; not too large. For the Main course, I tried a special, the Barolo braised beef short rib. It was outstanding, and paired with grilled zucchini and yellow squash and a dollop of the best cheesy rich polenta I have ever had. Finished off the wine with a chocolate mousse cake. No real cake, this is all about the chocolate mousse. It was a bit grainy at first, but as it warmed up a little, it became smooth and creamy. Let it warm a bit. Ferenet Branca to finish and it was an amazing event.By the time I finished the restaurant was absolutely packed. The wait staff was impeccable, and I never felt rushed; I felt like family. It is a 22 min walk from Union Square which helped work up an appetite before dinner, and helped settle dinner afterwards.

Decided to come here for dinner on a Friday night with hubby and 2 young kids. We were greeted by friendly staff. The food from appetizer (calamari vinegarette) to the short ribs, and lamb shank were all amazing. We couldn't leave without ordering dessert so we ordered the tiramisu and cream caramel pudding (flan) and both were AMAZING. The best tiramisu we ever had. We will definitely come back.

Even though it was a busy Saturday night - we did not feel rushed -- lots of help explaining the menu and making exceptions if we wanted it a little different - gnocchi were to die for - we split an order just so we could all experience the flavor.You cannot go wrong - suggest making reservations as it does get crowded!

Firenze By Night came highly recommended as having authentic Italian food cooked by those who know what they're doing. They were right. Gnocchi was perfect, ravioli tasted like it came from a kitchen in Rome. Friendly staff, cozy atmosphere. Nice place to go. Why then, don't they use fresh grated Parmesan? It was straight from the Kraft jar to the serving tin. Powdered. Wow. If stuff like that doesn't bother you, give it a shot. Didn't taint the whole dinner but it sure made us wonder why.

Small Italian restaurant with excellent food and great waitstaff. My daughter lived in Florence and was meeting her roommate from Italy so she selected this restaurant.We began with some great appetizers and then moved on to the main courses. My daughter had the GNOCCHI FIRENZE was excellent and most filling. I had the PENNE MARE E MONTI was great with lots of flavor. My wife had the CANNELLONI BIAGIO which, too, was great. Everything tasted perfectly. There was also a nice selection of wines to select from.

This restaurant was recommended to us and we went along for my birthday on 30th December. It was very busy and we had no reservation. We had to wait about an hour to be seated but got free snack....it was worth the wait! This is the best pasta I have ever eating...it was melt in your mouth delicious. The atmosphere and service was excellent. They even delivered a little birthday cake with candle and sang happy birthday to me... If you are in San Fransisco you should do yourself a favour and eat here.

We had a table for 10 in the back room, which was perfect. Our waiter was attentive, helping everyone wade through the menu and make their choices. Most couples shared a salad and had a main course or plate of pasta as their main dish. Being Italian, I felt the very small portion of vegetables and polenta on each plate was not enough, but for most people I'm guessing it would be fine. Corkage of $20 per bottle is steep, but we had 7 bottles of wine, and it suited our needs. In summary, a good experience for us, good food, and good service.

My wife and I didn't have reservations for our first choice Italian restaurant which was booked up and which recommended us to Firenze By Night. We were immediately seated in the center of the small and crowded dining room. I had the aged beef and arugula salad which was the equal of any that I had in Firenze itself. Main course for me was osso bucco special. And for my wife the seafood linguini special which she enjoyed. The wines were good but the inexpensive stemware did not equate to the prices for the wine. We both agreed it was a good meal but preferred Trattoria Pinocchio for the lively atmosphere, generous wine servings and high quality stemware.

We have been here twice and both times we were not disappointed. The waiters speak Italian and English. Their gnocchi is truly delicious. The desserts are also great. The only drawback is the neighborhood and a single toilet bathroom for men and women. The place is a good local eatery however that should not be missed.

My party of 5 arrived just at our reservation time, the host checked to make sure our table was ready before seating us. Took about 30 seconds, but I appreciated the extra attention. Our waiter was extremely attentive, but also unobtrusive. We always had fresh water, even before we could ask. The food was very good, my party ordered a variety of different options on the menu and we shared our dishes. The bill was expensive, but I expected that for 5 people with multiple alcoholic beverages. We ate here before seeing Beach Blanket Babylon. I was unfamiliar with the area so looked online to see what dining options there were. My first choice, after calling 3 times during their advertised business hours and the call not being picked up, I moved on. Firenze by night is where I moved on too, I was glad I did. The atmosphere was quiet, with great ambience. With all the other great dining options in San Francisco, I'm not sure I would come back, just because I want to experience all the other choices. I did hear one customer talking with the staff like they were old friends which led me to believe he was a regular customer. Enjoy!

WOW! Can you say homemade!!! This place is legit. Placed on the outer reaches of Little Italy, and tucked between a variety of other establishments this one may be easy to miss. But I must say it is worth seeking out. The front signage is simple, and when stepping inside it was quiet, fairly plain but oozing with charm. The dimly lit bar area is the first thing you see, but beyond that the cozy little dining room will call your name. The tables, covered in white linens and adorned with a bottle of olive oil that will eventually call your name. It was that good....and that was just the olive oil. Can you imagine? The three in my party ordered veggie lasagna (which was claimed to be the best mean in San Fran over the course of five days by my sister) the Gnocchi, and an amazing carbonara stule pasta. All three were packed with flavor and clearly made from scratch. The best kind. It feels like the place could have a mob meeting going on right in the back at any given moment. That comment is meant to speak to the authentic feel of the place, not a nod to anything else. I loved this restaurant and will return on my next visit to this city for sure. Go, find it, do yourself a favor!

To begin with the, the service started off very good - The waiter joked, spoke Italian, and delivered drinks and meals promptly - but it went downhill from there. The bread was half between Focaccia and Itallian bread. We understood that gnocchi was the premiere dish of this restaurant, so that is what we ordered. It was very mushy and all the water had not been drained from either of the two dishes. One serving was once and a half the size of the second serving. The sauce was flavorless and uninspired. The night that we visited, there were many open tables, however, we were not asked if we wanted coffee or dessert - we were simply given the check. The decor is dated and very, very worn. Perhaps we have been spoiled living halfway between the North End in Boston and Federal Hill in Providence, but our experience here was in no way authentic or pleasurable.

OK so while on the cable cars, we were discussing good places to eat in SF and the one couple we spoke to absolutely raved about Firenze by Night. So we gave it a shot, but in the end we wished we had chosen elsewhere. The overall average rating was mostly due to the attentiveness that we got from our server Rosario albeit it was a Monday and very few people in the restaurant. My wife had the Fettuccini Buon Gustaio and I had the fish of the day which I believe was swordfish..... big mistake. Fish was overcooked and pretty bland tasting. I have had lots of swordfish in my day and this was just not right although the Caesar and the Estiva salads were good. By all accounts the Fettuccini was OK but with very few people in the restaurant there really is no excuse for overcooking fish.

Florenza by Night was such a great surprise from the minute we walked in and was greeted by the owner, then by our waiter, then the wine, then the food...all excellent and charming. Standouts for me were the Mushroom appetizer which is stuffed with incredibly herbed meatball. All of us were blown away by the combined tastes and textures. The Calamari was also really good and marinated perfectly. The Gnocchi were like pillow from heaven, not the heavy lead balls that you get 90% of the time and the sauce was perfectly light but richly flavored, perfectly paired together. One of us had the Gnocchi as a main but I was torn and asked if they could do a half order which they were happy to do. I had the Veal Saltimbocca and it was melt in your mouth tender with a wonderful tangy citrusy sauce. The Pappardelle with Rabbit Sauce was outstanding and very rich. The Petrale was in a very different sauce than I had ever had before and was excellent. I now have to see if I can replicate it at home!Great place...can't wait to go back next time I'm in North Beach. Perfect location for after Beach Blanket Babylon...

We probably wouldn't have walked down that sprig of Stockton if it wasn't for a beat cop pointing to it and saying it's possibly the best Italian restaurant in the area. We enjoyed more of a lunch there, simple glasses of wine, shared a salad. All things that bring out the worst in service in a restaurant but not here, these guys rocked ! The waiter had the flair of someone helping you out in Naples. The food, well you'll have to go for yourself to see just how much you like it. But if you don't then you probably are on another curve regarding appreciation. I recommended it to friends who go to SFO every year, they'd been several times and echo'd back to me the same.

This restaurant is located in San Francisco's &quot;Little Italy&quot; and has a wonderful Italian atmosphere. If you are lucky your waiter will be Fabio who will attentive and very helpful with your questions about the menu. The items we had on the menu were excellent and the wine the best I had in San Francisco. Of course it was imported from Italy. The locals frequent this restaurant so be aware it is not quiet but has the welcome and happy feeling of the Italian family atmosphere.

I've been to this restaurant several times and have always got the paperdelle with rabbit sauce. It is delicious. The last time I got it, the noodles were about 2 inches wide like lasagna noodles. Very good flavor. My last trip there I decided to try the gnocchi in a tomato/cream sauce. The sauce was very good, but the gnocchi were the worst I have EVER eaten. It was Mother's Day and the place was full so I don't know if that drove down the quality, but the gnocchi were tough and gummy. I was hungry so I finished them, but I will never order them again at Firenze. Also had the mozzarella/tomato/basil appetizer. I had previously tried the salad which contains all of that plus croutons but it was all chopped up, and the flavor was not that good. The appetizer, however, was what I really wanted. I will get that again, although the beefsteak tomatoes are not sweet like the ones I get in Italy. This would have been an above average meal if the gnocchi wasn't so tough.

We went here to celebrate my husband's birthday with family. We were a party of 7 so it was tight in the small back section of the restaurant. The service was excellent, but the food was good. I ordered the Scallops (fish special-yum!), my brother ordered the Saltimbocca alla Roman (just OK), my hubby ordered the Petto di Polo alla Toscana. Desserts were the highlights: Tartufo di Chocolate (my favorite!), chocolate mousse and chocolate raspberry cake were all delicious. Corkage fee was a bit steep-$20-so make sure it is a special bottle of wine. Our waiter-Fabio Ziino--was superb and put up with us, including tasting a spoiled bottle of wine for us! Thank you!!

Very cool little place in North Beach area. Classic Italian ambiance, excellent service from attentive waiter and busboy who did not let my water glass become empty. Had a nice crisp green salad with just the right amount of a tasty dressing. The gnocci were fantastic, quite possibly the best I've ever eaten (sorry grandma!). The tartufo was a nice finish, mascarpone in the middle, cocoa powder on the outside. Lovely meal, will definitely go back for more gnocci.

Outstanding food, great ambiance, large menu, warm bar and wonderful service. Our waiter was perfect, Fabio, ask for him if you go. Very pleasant, accommodating and attentive but not smothering. Food was some of the best...bruscetta, very fresh tomatoes and good amont of garlic..yum....Mushroom Risotta was perfectly prepared, rich and creamy. We had the swordfish which was large and the Veal Saltimbuca with mushrooms added...tres magnifique.... The pasta had a wonderful tasting Pomodora sauce and the angel hair perfectly al dente. Save room for the cheesecake dessert..like butta. My only remark to the contrary would be that I would have liked the swordfish (which was a large flat portion) a little smaller in diameter and thicker in size to hold up to the grilling. That said it still was very tasty..just a personal choice so if thats how you like it as well, ask for it. Overall, outstanding restaurant in Little Italy and ask for Fabio...you cant go wrong here.

No where near good Italian food. My wife and I split three items. Bruchetta toast was not toasted enough, too much oil, garlic and tomato okay but no basil or other seasoning. Gnocchi, which they are known for, was light and tasty with a light creamy tomato sauce. Worst of all, the petrale sole was drenched in the butter sauce making a gooey mess. There is no effort at all made to plate dishes attractively. On the bright side, our waiter was excellent and attentive. My advice is to try somewhere else.

We were a fairly large party (9) and we were lucky to get a table on short notice for early dinner. Food was good, not great. Most entries are in the $17 to $20 range, and salads add another $6 each. Cheapest wine was about $32 a bottle. Not sure of corkage fee, but if we go bacvk, will bring our own! Appetizers (brushetta, and tomatoes with mozarella) were a little bland. Had the gnocchi and not as good as a few years ago. Dinner for 9 with 2 bottles of $32 wine and 20% tip was about $350!We had dessert across the street a Stella Pasties - what a treat!

We were recommended this restaurant whilst staying at the Ritz and generally they don't recommend bad places - they didn't let us down.We were initially unsure after reading some of the reviews - but pressed ahead anyway. No wonder Frank Sinatra used to always come here when in San Fransisco - it has truly passionate owners who were proud to be recreating the food their mum used to provide and they were incredibly friendly and we were made to feel at home by them.Our food was all fresh and tasted authentic. It wasn't fine dining, just great Italian food with good service. We went to a highly regarded fine dining Italian in Whistler last week and gave it a 2 out of 5, this place is what all Italians should strive to be like - we will be returning on our next stay here.

Getting a reservation at a first class restaurant on Valentine's Day can be a problem - unless you had your wedding reception there. This small restaurant is family owned business in its second generation of operation. I'm very biased in my view of Firenze by Night becasue I've been eating here since it opened over 20 years ago. It just gets better. Leave the car home but ther eis parking in the Muni garage on Vallejo.

We had walked all day, were really tired and just happy to finally get to the Little Italy district in San Fran. We checked TA and found this restaurant close by. It was early so we had no problem getting seated right away. The service was wonderful, the food hot and good, my pasta dish was wonderful although my husband thinks they might have prepared his dish in a pan that had had fish prepared in it before, because although good his tasted a little off. Appetizers were great and the gelato dessert just grand.

While I appreciate that for some, the Olive Garden is the standard for Italian food, we know better having traveled through Italy and living in a eastern city with a big Italian population. This place falls short even by the Olive Garden standard. The bread is stale, the soup is watery, the pasta is like &quot;hamburger helper&quot;, the salad is more of a garnish, the meat is mysterious and the tiramasu tastes &quot;store bought&quot;. We were sent here by our hotel-strike 1; it is more in chinatown-strike 2; there are celebrity photos on the wall-strike 3. I got the bill....IM OUT!

Excellent food all around.Started with a few salads and calamari, which was the best we had while in SF.For main dish the server recommended the seafood linguini over the special risotto, and the risotto would have had to been amazing for him to be wrong. The mussels and shrimp were cooked perfectly in a nice white wine sauce.My wife, and half the table, had the award winning gnocchi firenze, the award being well deserved.Excellent service as well. Everything came out with very nice timing, and our server knew his menu and wine list very well. Overall great experience.

This is my first visit to this small gem in the North Beach area of San Francisco. The restaurant, while small in size is grand in atmosphere! The food was lovely, we had one order of the special fish and one of the special veal. Both great. Then there were two orders of ravioli, fair but not great. In addition we had the chicken soup, spinach salad, gnocchi and the white beans with tuna. All were delightful.

The gnocchi and the carbonara are by far the best I have tasted... not to mention the service is superior! Make sure you pop in and say hi to Rosario (kinda looks like Robert Downey Jr)!! Oh and what a great selection of wines! ;-) go to Paolo for your choice of wines!

Hearing Eyetalian as you begin to take your seat, you can feel hospitality of place.Place has more of a feel of neighborhood on east coast, as you might find I'm Boston or NYC or even Chicago.You will also notice when any party leaves there are handshakes and a thank you for coming. My server was Mike, the bartender, and fit into this server categorization even though he need to handle all the drink orders and credit card transactions.Having had only appetizer and main course it's hard to generalize on balance of menu. Meal was nice, fresh, and authentic. Given price-point, this was within the range one should expect. You will a pleasant time and a decent meal without the rush in other North Beach eateries.Only downside, pass on the bread -- more of a reflection on the great breads that San Francisco can offer and you'll be disappointed here, so instead save calories for dessert!

This restaurant has provided Amarone, my favorite wine, friendly service, a lovely restaurant with a mural of Firenze, and an amazing menu with wonderful food. I got the gnocchi which was wonderful. The strachiatella was wonderful. The veal dish was so delicate and tasty. If you want a wonderful Italian restaurant in San Francisco, you must try this restaurant.

We had group of six. The food, service and atmosphere were all impeccable. Try the veal or fish and you won't be disappointed, but I imagine everything is excellent given their attention to detail and focus on making the customer feel at home and as if the entire evening revolves around him or her. The menu is broad enough for most tastes and moods. It has a pretty good wine list too.

I had the gnocchi in a light cream sauce with a bottle of chianti riserva. Outstanding. The flavor was incredible. Our table also had the veggie lasagna, veal parmigiana, and risotto with sausage. All were excellent. This small restaurant will certainly meet your image of what a good italian restaurant looks like. The waiters are experts in the food. I guarantee you will not be disappointed.

We walked in with no reservations on Saturday evening and were sat promptly. Our waiter Marco was absolutely terrific. He was kind, attentive and very helpful. Both my husband and I had the spinach raviolis which were delicious. We also shared some bruschetta which was the best we have ever had. Although we did not drink any wine with dinner, I checked out the wine list and was very impressed. My cousin works in North Beach and he referred us there which I am very grateful that he did. The next morning this restaurant was featured on our hotel guide for being one of the best in San Francisco and it did not disappoint!

We were in town on business and our company took us to this restaurant for dinner. Therefore, I cannot comment on the prices of the food. However, a glass of wine was around $7.50, so it wasn't priced too much out of line with other restaurants.Salad was not really what I prefer, but was good. The bread was excellent. The two main courses were excellent! And desert was ice cream, also very good. Small quiet little place. There were approximately 28 in our party, so we were seated in one of their back dinning rooms. Dining room was a little small, but there was plenty of room to move about and leave the area if needed. We had two waiters that were very good; kept drink glasses filled as well as tending to our every need. Food was served quickly and hot. I also enjoyed the decor of the restaurant. We would recommend this restaurant and we would definitely eat here again!

It's like going to Italy for the night to have dinner with your Italian uncle Sergio. I have not been to this restaurant in 19 years. Sergio hugged me and asked about my family, like it was last week. The food is amazing. Have the gnocchi. it gets very crowded. If you like quiet dining. Go later, or get the private room. Ask to be seated in the main dining room, it's nicer than the tables in the bar.

Firenze was chosen for its location near to Beach Blanket Babylon, but it is a spot one would go to just for the wonderful food it serves. My chiropractor had recommended it when I was moaning about the fact that eggplant parmesan is an order from the past in most East Bay restaurants. Not here. The best I have ever experienced! He said it was just like his Italian grandmother made, so true. Others had an assortment of dishes which were all as tasty.It is hard to hear with a large group, whether from the high ceiling acoustics or all the conversations going on with a packed restaurant, but don't let that detract from the total authentic Italian experience. Sorry other restaurants in the area....this is now my go to recommendation.

We went to Firenze on recommendation of our hotel concierge when we asked for a good Italian restaurant in North Beach. We were given three to choose from and Firenze fit our taste best as we were looking for traditional fare.We were seated quickly even without reservations. This was probably due to us picking an early dinner hour. The place did get very busy as the evening wore on so I would suggest reservations if you plan to eat at prime dinner time.Our waiter was attentive and knew the menu well. You are started off with a small loaf of Italian bread, Olive oil is on the table for dipping. My husband had bruschetta for an appetizer. The bread was a bit hard so he ended up scraping the tomatoes onto the bread brought out earlier and that was yummy. For dinner he had the Gamberoni pizzaiola, jumbo prawns with fresh tomato and garlic. The sauce was rich and delicious, not at all over powering. He totally loved it. I had the pollo con fungi, roasted chicken with mushrooms, garlic and rosemary in a wine sauce. The brown sauce was fantastic and the chicken was so moist.The restaurant itself is not anything special but my husband and I both thought the food was great and the service exceptional. We would recommend this place to anyone looking for a traditional northern Italian meal.

Avoid this place unless you like old school, traditional, enormous portions. All the web sites rave over the Firenze gnocci. Well, it's nothing but an oversized plate of oversized gnocci in a very bland tomato cream sauce. They had absolutely no flavor and could have been so much better. My family also had the warm spinach salad with pine nuts and bacon. Again, it sounds great, but lacked flavor. I think it was tossed in canola oil, it was so bland. We also had two of their veal dishes, one in a wine sauce with porcini mushrooms, the other with a pesto sauce. Again, both were dumbed down for the tourist palate and lack any real depth or flavor. Even the bread they served before the meal was totally anemic.....hello Firenze, you're in the bread capitol and can't even serve a decent sourdough?!??! Go elsewhere.

I stopped here for dinner on a whim. I was hoping for a slightly more inspired menu (Italian with a California twist, perhaps), but that's not what this place is. It's straight up Italian classics. My boyfriend and I ordered the spinach ravioli (which was excellent) and the Papardelle with rabbit, which was also very good. We had tiramasu for dessert, which was just ok.The atmosphere and decorum is lacking. The faux marble finish on the walls is pretty ugly. The tables are also very close together.

Located on the edge of Chinatown and North Beach Italian communities, and around the corner from the famous Beach Blanket Babylon, the restaurant is better inside than deciding to go there from the outside. We were recommended by a friend who goes there often and were treated like long lost friends in an Italian way. Excellent service and food quality. A white tablecloth and semi quiet classic interior were good for someone that doesn't want to scream over the noisy din of a &quot;live&quot; interior.

We came here for a late dinner on a Sunday night at the recommendation of our hotel's front desk staff. Since it was late (and Easter Sunday), the restaurant was not too crowded, which was perfect. We started with bruschetta (not realizing there would be a bread basket coming out shortly!) and it was all delicious and fresh. For entrees, we had gnocchi in tomato sauce and tortellini with peas and proscuitto in a cream sauce- both were fantastic! We somehow managed to save room for caramel pudding for dessert. Food and wine were reasonably priced and our server (I don't think I caught his name) was super friendly and helpful. This was the perfect dinner for the last night of our trip and I would come back again.

We were in San Francisco and looking for a great restaurant in North beach.I found this restaurant but was wondering if we should try in front of the restaurant. Then, some customers who just had a meal happily talked us and highly recommended, so we decided to try.OMG, I had Vongole (clam pasta) and my husband had gnocchi. Both of them are absolutely amazing! It was very simple but something I can never make at home. Service was great and not overly chatty and pushy like typical tourist restaurants.we even had a caramel pudding and a chocolate mouse cake and of course we fell in love with it.If you are going to San Fran, you must go!

Very nice restaurant.

We visited this nice restaurant on an early dinner with our 3 kids (6, 10, 13). The food was very tasty, fresh and well done. The dishes were quite big (especially the main courses). Service was kind and courteous. Kids friendly.

First time in North Beach and we were in the mood for some good Italian food. We were kind of overwhelmed with all the choices so we kind of threw a dart and landed here by accident and we are glad we did.The staff was very friendly ( and do speak Italian), the atmosphere is quiet, and the food was very good and light, not overly heavy.Loved the homemade Focaccia and the Gnocchi.All in all a great time spent with family in a authentic Italian setting.

Picked a good night to come - Tuesday night without reservations! The restaurant was fairly empty and quiet. Trust us - on a weekend this place packs it and without reservation you could be waiting for an hour! The wait staff was also authentic - true Italians ! How could you go wrong ! We split the Caesar salad and then ordered from the specials - scallop and mussels linguine and the veal scallopini with pine nuts and pesto cream sauce! No complaints there! Something about their taste and seasoning makes this one of my favorite places in Sf!On weekends come prepare to be loud in this restaurant ! It also has a full bar which makes it ten times louder! So if you're coming for wine and candlelight - not the place for you! Definitely a north beach classic!

Best Pesto Pasta we have ever had

Great food, good location and really nice people. What is there not to like. What keeps bringing us back is the Pesto Pasta. Never had anything like it. Tremendous. But all of their food is really good! Not a gourmet place but real memorial Italian dining experience and we have never been disappointed. We live close to the city and we make a point of coming her every two or three months. Two good parking lots around the corner, two Italian bakeries nearby and O'Reillys Irish Pub very close for an Irish Coffee after Pesto Pasta. Can't go wrong

Really Nothing Special

Although it is off the main restaurant strip, this places seems geared for tourists. I know if I lived in the area I would not be a regular or repeat customer. The food was okay. Really, the entrees were not bad at all. But they were nothing special, and better could be had for lower prices in the area. No doubt, one easily could do worse. The tiramisu was below average. Overall, the place was about average - really nothing special.

I don't mean to be offensive, but when I tell you this restaurant does not do pizza, chips, steaks or ketchup and the servings are of European size hopefully you will realise where I am coming from.This is probably as close as you can get to a genuine Italian restaurant without being in Tuscany. Their starters and soups are excellent, the pastas outstanding and the veal is the real deal. The serving sizes allow you to have three courses in true Italian style without over doing it - for example share the Bruschetta starter $3.75, followed by the vegetable soup $3.95 then a veal main with fresh vegetables $15.95, or a pasta dish $11.50.There you have the experience of three great tastes for around $20!!!! AND room for a dessert.Must book - good atmosphere - good service and good wine list.

Best Italian restaurant in North Beach Area. It is slightly off the main strip, but still right near the center of North Beach.Great atmosphere, friendly staff, and great food. I have been here multiple times and somehow they manage to make the food even better than the time before. The gnocchi makes for a great starter to split between two people, though do warn you that there will be a fight for the last one. Their main courses were perfect, everyone at the table devoured what they had, and desserts were a nice treat to finish the night.One of my favorite restaurants in San Francisco and always accounts for one dinner when I'm here.

Always an outstanding meal and good service since my first visit during its second year. The food and service were up to par but the ambiance wasn't as special as it is when the lights are a little dimmer and the place is mostly full . . . it was a Wednesday night and we missed a little of the the buzz of their typical happy wine laced clientele. But it is usually packed, especially on a weekend--reservations are advised and I suggest that you request to be seated in the front dining room.One of us had the Saltimbocca and the other their Scallopini. Both were delizioso. Though we skipped appetizers I did have some broth with tortellini . . . a nice way to warm up on a cold night. Of course their reasonably priced ($7 &amp; $8) pleasant house wine also helped remove the chill. If other restaurants would follow this lead they would sell a lot more wine and increase their profits.I've had several of their pasta and chicken dishes over the years and they were all excellent as are their desserts. These visits were with family and also with business contacts--a very appropriate venue for almost any occasion.Our only regret this time was that they didn't have any panna cotta to cap off this most satisfying meal :(Do not hesitate to try this wonderful restaurant . . . over and over again.

We loved the idea of a cluster of Italian restaurants so don't lose this like so many other places. Firenze was a very nice traditional non pizza restaurant. We both thoroughly enjoyed our linguine Ella leone with anchovies and red bell peppers and the ravioli. The wine list was extensive and we settled on a very nice cab sav. Although we arrived without a booking and could have been more suitably dressed we found the restaurant appealing and well worth a visit.The waiter although quite attentive did not establish any rapport or personality - we find this disappointing.....is this normal when tips are standard? We would much rather personable and friendly as well.

We had dinner at Firenze By Night prior to attending a performance of Beach Blanket Babylon (which is right around the corner). This was actually a restaurant that they recommended and let me say this was, hands down, the best meal we had during our stay in San Francisco. I had the Ravioli della Mama which just melts in your mouth. The pasta is fresh, filled with spinach and ricotta and the sauce was heaven. My hubby had one of the specials - the lamb shank - which just fell off the bone. Everything was delicious. For dessert, I had the tiramisu and OMG - absolutely the best. Our waiter said it was made fresh daily and you can certainly tell that it is. The service was absolutely the best. If you're in San Francisco and looking for a wonderful place for Italian food, make sure to stop here - you will not be disappointed!

My husband and I ordered cannelloni and gnocchi. The cannelloni was fabulous. The gnocchi was good. The sauce was average. The location was ok. White table clothes yet you can go in causal attire. Service was good despite the totally fake accent of our server. I wrote it off as they were trying to make you feel like you were Italy. The restaurant was very small. So conversation was not private at all. Also since tables are so close together I had the waiters behind in my face too frequently for comfort. But overall the food was great. Atmosphere not so much.

We stumbled upon this gem by the recommendations of our taxi cab driver. I had researched almost all day to find a good restaruant in the North Beach area that we all would like. I had not seen Firenza on my list, but I am very glad I got frustrated with my research and went with a locals instinct.This little restaurant had such a warm feeling, everyone was friendly and the atmosphere was great. The food was excellent and even made a few dishes that were not on the menu to accomadate someone in the group that couldn't have a specific ingredient.I would most certainly go back to Firenze again, just to try and different dish!

I live in North Beach and Firenze is one of my 3 favorite Italian restaurants in the area. The bar pours a nice, strong drink. My poison is Tanqueray and tonic. Always good and strong. The wine list is long and they have a great selection. I have never had a bad meal here. Don't listen to those few tools who have rated it as poor or terrible. They don't have tastebuds. I've taken many friends and family here and everyone of them has commented on the quality and taste of the food. Personally, I only get one appetizer here, the mushrooms stuffed with Italian sausage. It is so good, I don't want anything else. I use the bread to absorb every drop of the delicous sauce it comes in. My favorite dish is the veal saltimbocca. So tender you can cut it with your fork. My second favorite dish is their Lamb shank. It is not on the menu, it is a special they have one or twice a week. It is fall off the bone tender and a large portion served with tasty polenta. I'm normally not a fan of gnocchi but I will eat their Gnocchi Firenze entree. The staff is Italian and helpful with the wines or food choice. My only gripe is the noise level. On a busy night, when everybody is yapping away, it gets loud.

My friend and I went here early on a Sunday evening, so there was no wait. The waiter was prompt and helpful in deciding what we should get. The caprese salad was fresh and flavorful. We split the pasta with tomato cream sauce and shrimp, the pasta was cooked perfectly and the sauce was just the right amount of spice and garlicy, it was delicious. We also split the pork chop special, a pork chop stuffed with artichoke and gorgonzola, the meat was cooked perfectly and seasoned well. The food was all great! The desserts looked wonderful but we were too full, when I go next timeI will save room for the dessert!

A coworker recommended this restaurant. She deserves a big treat. The food was fantastic!!! They brought out a bowl of bread with oil for dipping. I had a mixed green salad and it had good dressing on it and the lettuce was crisp. The main dish was a special, a penne Gorgonzola with sun-dried tomatoes artichokes and chicken. Fantastic!! The sauce was delicious. I thought I couldn't eat anymore but I couldn't resist the desserts. An ice cream cappuccino with melted espresso chocolate in the middle and a hazelnut topping. I would go back just for the ice cream. This restaurant would be worth the wait on any night, I highly recommend. The service was fast and friendly and I thought the prices were reasonable for San Francisco.

Buzzing doesn't begin to describe it, on a recent Friday night, around 8 p.m. We had a nice glass of Italian wine at the bar and good salads and pasta, very similar to what we would have in Florence. Service was very quick, accurate, professional. I would give four and a half if possible.Very fair prices -- the wine was pricey, but salad and pasta for two, with a shared dessert and coffee, came in under $70 before tip. Be sure to hit the City Lights bookstore, just around the corner and down the hill, before or after dinner.Why not five? It was too noisy to converse, and there is no carpet or anything that might deaden the sound. And I didn't think the dishes had quite the complexity of flavor that I might hope to find in Italy -- it would get a 4 in Florence, so I'll give it a 4 here. But we would definitely go back.

This a quaint place with charm. The greeter/waiter is Italian, and puts on a good show. My main problem with it was that it felt almost fast food, with little time to relax. The salad and appetizer courses were served at the same time, which is not good. The main course arrived as we barely finished the starters. Perhaps looking to turn over the tables. Nevertheless, the food was fine.

Located on Stockton and Columbus, this unpretentious looking Italian restaurant cranks out great food! As other reviewers have said, you can easily walk on by this place and not give it a second thought. But you would be missing some truely authentic Italian cooking at its best. To echo other reviewers, the gnocchi is pillow perfect, but ask for extra sauce. Service is impeccable, and friendly. There is a full bar and an extensive wine list that showcases Italian and California wines. They have an extensive menu with daily specials that is sure to please the most discriminating palate. Parking can be a challenge. You can park on the street after 6pm or park in the North Beach garage on Vallejo st. which is just around the block. Firenze By Night (Florence by night); enjoy.

First off if you should happen to walk by Firenze you may just keep going. The location is not so appealing...however...we encourage you to go inside!! We read reviews ahead and were not disappointed. Small... friendly Italian waitstaff...mural of Florence on the wall...and authentic Italian food all make for a very pleasant relaxing experience. Warm spinach salad with pine nuts was excellent. The Cannelloni Biagio and the special of Mussels and Scallops Linguini was excellent. Varied selection of Italian wines. Also shared a yummy Tartufo Chocolate. We did make reservations and very glad we did as the restaurant filled up very quickly. Tourists as well as regulars...a good sign.Overall exactly as we expected and were looking for.

The food was acceptable but certainly nothing special. Our waiter was very nice and accommodating. The place is looking pretty shabby,which I guess is suppose to be &quot;atmosphere&quot;. What rankled me most, was the filthy men's room. I hope that is no reflection on the kitchen. With so many choices in the area, I would look for a cleaner toilet.

A few co-workers and I dined at Firenze while in San Francisco for a conference. After having 2 evening dinners at other restaurants that were sub-par, we hand our fingers crossed that Firenze would be a winner. It did not disappoint!Our waiter was very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. All 5 of us in my party loved the wine, appetizers and dinner.The only negative is the restroom situation... only a one-at-a-time so the line was backed up. Other than that, the experience was fantastic and I would whole-heartedly recommend this restaurant to others.

We really enjoyed the food, and I would have given Firenze a better rating, but our waiter was rude, He appeared rushed, and our service was slow and disjointed. We were served our warm spinich salads, which were quite good, and then we sat and watched him be attentive to everyone but us. The main courses were good, but we passed on dessert, because it took him to long to get back to us. This was a Sunday evening, and the restaurant was not that busy. I should have asked him his name, because the other people working there were very polite, and we obviously just got the wrong waiter.

Seated immediately (2 people, just shy of 7 PM), excellent spinach and mixed greens salads, delicious calamari appetizer (not fried - refreshing), outstanding papparedelle and seafood linguini, great tartufo and choc-raspberry cake. Agree with others that the bread is not great but not worth losing a full star on that. Friendly prompt service. Came here on a recommendation from friends and they were right on.

The Concierge at my hotel (Westin Palace) recommended this restaurant. It was a short cable car ride and a couple of block walk. I had a fantastic 3 course meal accompanied by a couple of glasses of Sangioveese wine. I had the mushrooms stuffed with mushrooms as an appetizer - it was very goooood. For dinner I had a veal with parmigiana cheese and eggplant. I topped this off with Tartufo and a Cappuccino. The meal in itself was great, but what really made it over the top was my waiter Michele who recommended a restaurant for my trip to Florence, Italy in March and the owner stopped by to say hello and see how I was doing. Made to feel very much at home and welcome while eating alone.

Excellent food and service. Ate here twice during a three day stay. Most entres under 20.00. My tip is to go to dinner a little early if you want to beat the crowds, this place gets packed after 7:00. I ate both nights around 6:00pm and had no wait and there were plenty of empty tables.

I lived in Florence for a year. Rarely do I find a restaurant in the US that has the feel of Firenze. This is the real thing. It wasn't just the Italian waitstaff...or the Italian wine...no, it was the white beans &amp; tuna salad, it was the rabbit on the menu. This could make me want to live in SF, just to walk here for long, yummy dinners.

On a busy sat. nite we were seated without a reservation...service was fast and we never felt rushed. wine selection was very good. there were actually 6 specials that nite .we each had a different and sampled each others, all were so very tasty.......the overall experience was fabulous.The saltimbocca and Pappardelle toscana are the best.......the only reason for not giving 5 stars is the bread for the dipping olive oil was ordinary........otherwise if you have friends from out of town they will love this place and so will you.

I have eaten here three times and each has been a treat! Most recently, five friends and I decided to go in early and have a small meal before going to a show. We sat at the bar and enjoyed appetizers and small portions of the Gnocchi. The service was excellent and the food - outstanding. The wine list goes from the very reasonable to high end - I would say there is something for everyone. The restaurant is small which allows for a warm, family feel. This is one of my for sure &quot;go to&quot; places when visiting San Francisco.

Go here. I cannot stress that enough. Whether you're in the market for Italian food or not, you will be by the time you've left this place. It is small, which gives it a homey feeling, like you're in grandma's kitchen not a restaurant. When I was there, the staff spoke with an Italian accent, showing authenticity. The food was so fresh that it tasted like it had been pulled straight from a garden. I had linguine with pesto, and the waiter was delighted to leave off the butter (Veg friendly). If you want a dessert they have an excellent selection, however you're in the heart Little Italy, so there are bakeries everywhere. There is room for parties and also couples. The interior is decorated with statues and plants, and the wait staff can be seen running in and out of the kitchen doors delivering meals. I was seated by a man who apparently seemed to be the owner. He had a welcoming aura and kept control of his employees well. Wine is a big deal in San Francisco and there's no shortage here. There is something on the menu for kids, adults and seniors to enjoy. Leave your heart in San Francisco, and your fork in Little Italy!

I was told to go here if I like gnocchi. I was told right. It was sort of interesting in texture. Very smooth and somewhat like mashed potatoes. But in a good way. I know that sounds weird. But the gnocchi were delicate. The waiter told me that he really likes it with the bolognese. I asked him to do half of it with the original sauce and the other half with the bolognese. I asked him later to bring me a bowl of the bolognese to eat by itself. It was good! The starter bread was not mediocre and a little cold. I had the minestrone soup to start. I assumed that it was part of my meal in the way that he asked me if I would like a soup or a salad. But I was charged for it. Sorta pricey for soup, too. But it was good. Simple, but good. The meal was good but a little expensive.

We were looking for a local place, not something tourists go to and we found it! The food was delicious and our waiter Michael was informative and entertaining.

The ambiance of the place was exactly what we were looking for, local, authentic with lots those campy celebrity photos on the wall. If you want authentic North Beach Italian go here.

A group of us (7) went to this restaurant on a Tuesday night for the first time without knowing much about it besides a cursory check that the reviews were generally positive. Turned out this was one of the best Italian meals for all of us, and a majority of us have traveled extensively. We liked this restaurant for a number of reasons: it was authentic, the food was very fresh and nicely prepared, the atmosphere was relaxing; the owner of the restaurant was very friendly and so were his waiting staffs. With 7 people, we ordered a variety of entrees and appetizers, they were all very good. The deserts and the wine. That was the night we all had a good time, and I'm sure we will be back. Thank you Sergio!

Firenze by Night

Food very good but service was poor. I wanted a quiet romantic evening to celebrate our anniversary. Firenze by Night in North Beach San Francisco provided very good food. After a warm welcome we gave our order and chose the wine. We would have been out in under 40 minutes. Had we not decided to deliberately go slow with the rest of our meal. The waiters did not change the table cloths on tables around us, instead shook them in the air, covering guests in crumbs from previous customers and then turned the table cloths over. Our bill was thrown across the table and no offer of coffee was provided. For a so called high class restaurant its customer service leaves something to be desired. If you like quality fast food, then I would describe this place as a quality upmarket McDonalds.

After attending a Giants game, we thought we would drive over to North Beach and walk around until we found a restaurant that looked good. We parked near a police station and asked a few who were standing outside for a recommendation. Pete sent us to Firenze By Night. It was a great suggestion! Our waiter, Fabio, was the best! He was very personable and encouraged us to try the Gnocchi as an appetizer. It was fabulous! I highly recommend ordering it for your main course. My husband had the Osso Bucco special and it was very flavorful and tender. I had the Ravioli (based on the information that Sinatra ordered it every time he was in town), and enjoyed it very much. Our friends had the veal special and the veal ravioli which they both loved. We were dressed very casually (Giants shirts and sweatshirts), but most others were nice casual or slightly dressy. I will definitely return to this restaurant!

I joined my brother and family for dinner in San Fransisco as they passed through on their way back to the UK.

The bruschetta was delicious, but after that (and having eaten in many Italian restaurants,) the main courses were particularly average and the Tiramisu positively poor.

The gnocchi alone is worth your while but there is an exceptional wine list, delicious desserts, and the owner/chef is warm, welcoming and generous--straight from Italy--as are many of the staff. Pronunciation is perfect for this authentic Italian fare in the heart of San Francisco. Located in the Italian neighborhood, there are at least two Italian bakeries nearby that offer more delectable delights for a late night indulgence. An easy cab ride from the financial district, Union Square or Russian Hill, don't miss what is one of the best epicurean experiences this side of Italy!

This is a wonderful and very authentic Italian restaurant in North Beach. We were impressed that, due to a lack of taxis, we were 30 minutes late for our reservation and they still sat us right away. They were very friendly and attentive waiters. The Gnocchi was delicious...nice and light. My kids loved it, too. My husband had a delicious Sea Bass special and I had the Dover Sole which was wonderful, too. The bread and desserts are all homemade and excellent. My daughter loved her cheesecake, too. The wine list was very reasonable as was the entire meal. We will definitely go back again and reccommend it for families.

We thought it was just OK, and definitely not the best meal we had on our weeklong trip.

This was our second visit to Firenze by Night in as many trips to San Francisco. Our cab driver endorsed this place as where the locals go to eat excellent Tuscan style cooking. We were greeted promptly by the owner and seated quickly. The bread was of the Italian style from a local bakery which was a nice change from from our daily dose of sourdough. My son had the angel hair pasta with marinara sauce. The pasta was cooked perfectly and the sauce savory. My wife had the swordfish special which was grilled perfectly and served with a side of linguine with pappardelli sauce. The fish was excellent but the pappardelli sauce was amazing. My wife could not get enough of it. I had the cod special which was prepared with white wine and garlic. The seasoning, texture and flavor were exceptional. We enjoyed a fabulous meal and do not hesitate to recommend this restaurant to those looking for good cooking, reasonalbe prices and attentive service.

I went here after seeing the beach blanket babylon show, which provides a brochure that contains an ad &amp; free dessert coupon for Firenze by night. My family &amp; I ordered the gnocchi &amp; linguine with clams dishes - the gnocchi was good, however, it was expensive for the portion size. We ordered 5 desserts with the 5 coupons we had for the show, but we were unfairly charged for all of the desserts except for one because our waiter claimed that the ad was printed incorrectly and then ran off with a loud sigh. We thought that was pretty rude. Go to caffe macaroni sciue sciue - the food is better quality, more fairly priced, and the waiters are warm &amp; fuzzy!

Received a recommendation from a local to check out Firenze by Night. Walking by in the evening this place kind of looks kind of bad. We were pleasantly surprised and found this to be a true hidden gem. The menu is impressive. My boyfriend compared it to a chinese retaurant menu where they have a bazillion items crammed into a few pages. As a Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmare watcher i was a little worried (large menus never are a good thing on the show). The servers are truly italian. I found their accents a little hard to understand and impressive at the same time.The food came out impressively quick and we gobbled down our Ravioli &amp; Lasagna. Both dishes were cooked to perfection and full of flavor. We packed a Tiramisu to go (we were both too full but couldn't resist) and were on our way.I definitely recommend this for a delcious Italian Meal in North Beach.

Dined here last night-Simply the best Italian we have had in a long time.I'm full Italian, been to Italy many times and love Italian food-But this is still some of the best food we have had.We ate early on a Monday because we had our granddaughter with us. Our hotel concierge recommend this place because he hadn't heard of the top two restaurants on Yelp. So we decided to try this place, what the hell.We were seated promptly-it was a rainy Monday and the restaurant was about 1/4 full.We were served by Giuseppe. He was wonderful. He took great care of us. Since our GD was very hungry he rushed an order of ravioli for her which was very nice.They served us foccacia and sourdough bread with olive oil. Have not had foccacia in a long time. Very soft and flavorful.I started with the tortellini soup. The tortellini were very good and the chicken brodo was flavorfulI tried my wife's insalata Estiva which was basil, cheese, tomatoes, oil and onion. It was ok but not for me.Lately I've been rating restaurants by the quality of the risotto. I tried their risotto with porcini mushrooms. Very well prepared, the right texture just below al dente. GREAT flavors and such a simple dish they did a wonderful job.I tried my GD's raviolis which were good. Spinach and cheese in a meat sauce. The sauce was slightly bland but good. I just like a spicier meat sauce. But still good just the same.I got to try my the tortellini alla Romana which is a white cream sauce. I didn't try the torts again since I had them with my soup. The cream sauce was excellent I would order that again.For desert we had the chocolate mousse and the tiramisu. The mousse was great good flavors. The tiramisu was too sweet for my taste.Overall, this was an excellent experience. The server was great. The majority of food I tried was wonderful and we will be back to this place when in SF again.

When you travel to a city that is known for its food and has over 3000+ establishments, selections are tough.

We checked Trip Advisor and all looked good.All we can say is GO....GO....GO!The food is awesome, the staff on their &quot;A&quot; game and the entire experience was one that makes memories.The gnocchi was the best my family has ever eaten. My totellini in cream sauce was fantastic. They have a solid Italian wine list and are very good at comparing it for you, to American varitels.We are telling our Northern California friends about this place and we will be back.

When we asked our hotel's concierge where to get good Italian food in San Francisco when we stayed at a Fisherman's Wharf hotel, he recommended Firenze's. He said that their food is homemade and they are known for their gnocchis. So we walked to this restaurant and had fabulous service and delicious food. There were many specials and an extensive menu but all three of us had caesar salads and gnocchis. Even though we have been to Italy and had great meals there, this food was better!!!!!

It was fantastic, only a few blocks walk from the hotel, no wait for a table, although we were there on a Monday night.The bread was awesome and fresh. We could hear our food being cooked to order so we knew it was going to be delicious! We had our food served within 10 mins of ordering!We both got pasta dishes for around $10 each and it was more than enough food to eat in one meal. Drinks were very reasonably priced as well.There aren't very many tables, I can imagine on the weekends there might be a wait.We would definatly go back!

Dined here prior to Beach Blanket (which is a block away) with visiting family. As others have mentioned, this neighborhood restaurant staff makes you feel part of the family by the time your meal is complete. Many other diners seemed on first name basis with servers.Don't miss the gnocchi! And also the papardelle with rabbit sauce....divine. One of our party has an allergy to onions and the kitchen made a special pork dish, which she inhaled.Decent wine selection. Peach sorbet in peach shell and caramel pudding were dreamy.While we did not choose, the specials of swordfish and sole sounded delicious.You will feel like you've had a quick trip to Italy.....

The Sangiovese and Gnocchi were great. After that, it was mostly downhill. My Veal Saltimbocca was uninspiring and the tortellini with cream sauce that my daughter ordered was no better than you would find at a Pasta Pomodoro. Although it was very simple, the Papardelle with Bolognese sauce proved to be a tasty special that night. The staff is very friendly and helpful and service is excellent at Firenze By Night. The overall atmosphere is old school and very charming. I just wish the food was better. We skipped dessert and left for a gelato at Naia, just down the block. Now that's good stuff!

Our hotel concierge recommended this gem, and we were not disappointed! A pleasant walk from the Wharf area, right off Columbus Avenue, Firenze by Night was a great find. The staff greets you and makes you feel so welcome as soon as you walk in the door. Before the evening was over, we felt like old friends! The food was outstanding. One of the specialties was the homemade gnocchi, and it was second to none! A varied menu of Italian favorites plus unique specialties make the selection process difficult! Complete wine selection, delicious bread, great food, service, wait staff....I can think of nothing by but accolades for this restaurant! A must visit if you are looking for a great Italian meal!

Crowded and bustling, this restaurant seemed to be full of regulars (always a good sign!) The bar is tiny, and it's hard to find a place to put yourself, but the owner seated us 10 minutes before our 8:30 reservation time. The gnocchi was light and fluffy, and the papperadelli was out of the world. Our cute Italian waiter recommended the terrimisu for dessert, and boy, was he right. It was light and fluffy, and we had no problen finishing the one shared plate, despite being so full from the rest of our dinner.I will definitely go back. Make sure to make reservations

We have been fans for a few years. Last night our group of four went to celebrate my wife's birthday. Raffaello, our waiter, took fantastic care of us throughout the evening. We ordered cocktails and since one of our party was good friends with the owner's son were comped some fantastic bruschetta. We ordered three of their special spinach salalds with hot brand,y and bacon w/ pine nuts salad and one ribolitta (veg soup). All excellent, especially the salads. Then we had the special petrale sole, vitello alla Medici, and the chicken ravioli special. The petrale and veal were served with al dente vegetable and creamy polenta. We offered each other tastes and all you saw were smiles and heads nodding.Spumoni, bundini (flan), and coffee were next with a rousing Happy Birthday chorus by the waitstaff for my wife. It was an excellent evening once again. This is a do not miss if you are in North Beach. We saw the owner of the Forty Niners hosting a table in the back and the SF Chief of Police in another room. What a night!

Returned to this North Beach classic in mid-January three years after first, outstanding visit. Really expecting same wonderful Italian meal but ended up with one of the worst restaurant experiences ever. They did seat us upon arriving at reservation time but quality of food was far, far below even the standard of poor food - The Olive GArden. They ran out of swordfish special by 7 PM and offered filet of sole instead. Unfortunately waiter neglected to say it would be breaded which was unappealing to the lady who ordered it. When the sole arrived it was swimming in oil and accompanied by outrageously overcooked green beans. In fact, they were mush. An order of vegetable lasagna was devoid of vegetables and the pasta was almost goopy. Obviously it had been sitting for hours in the kitchen. An order of pappardelle with rabbit ragout was bland and with sparse ragout. The bread was an embarrassment to San Francisco. The wines by the glass were way below other similar establishments. All in all, a restaurant that has fallen considerably and should be avoided considering the quality of Italian cuisine elsewhere in this city. I see this happen all to frequently in my city (Los Angeles) and always wonder how it can occur. Thankfully, in five nights in San Francisco this was the only poor meal.

This North Beach Italian restaurant is a true Italian eating experience! Their award winning gnocch i is to die for! Listen to the specials - always interesting. The service is great and the waiters are attentive This restaraunt was referred by a hotel conceirge years ago. As a midwesterner I find myself in San Francisco at least once a year and I never miss visiting Firenze By Night. We tell all of our friends and colleagues who visit not to miss and they have all enjoyed the restaurant as well. Make reservations so that you don't miss this one!

We visited Firenze By Night on the last evening of our weekend trip to San Fran. It was by far our most delicious and memorable meal. That day (Sun, Oct 9th) was the Italian Parade and the owner's daughter was Queen. When we walked into the restaurant it was a happy, loud, excited crowd. I loved every moment. It reminded me of home and my big Italian family! My husband had the gnocchi (delish) and I had the special of the day, lamb ravioli with a cream mushroom sauce (to die for). If you are looking for a cozy, not too pricey, hometown feel, this is the place to go. It's in North Beach right on a main road with the Muni stop close by. Easy to find and get to. Every person working was friendly and helpful. The owner came around several times to see how everyone was doing, even though most of his family was there celebrating. I would go back in a heart beat! I would reccommend reservations.

We love Italian food, even went to Italy for our honeymoon, so I was looking for a good Italian restaurant for our recent San Francisco trip. My search produced Firenze by Night and boy am I glad I made a reservation because the place was packed. The tables were full of locals! Groups celebrating birthdays and anniversaries, dressed up couples on dates. The owner of the place continually worked the room, hugging repeat customers and getting to know new ones. The atmosphere made you feel like family. The room was a bit loud, but my husband and I still felt the romance over candlelight and a bottle of wine. The food was absolutely wonderful. I caved and tried the famous gnocchi and I see why it is famous. This was better than the gnocchi I had in Italy. The pillows of dough literally melted in my mouth and the sauce complimented it perfectly. My husband tried one of the specials which was a braised beef wrapped in veal served over polenta and vegetables. He loved it, it was so tender you didn't even need a knife. I would not hesitate to try this place at all, wether your a tourist or a local...but definitely make a reservation.

This place has been our family favorite for some time. However, the srvoce has gone downhill. The food is still the best in San Francisco, but you'll pay for it yet get very slow service. If you have the time and the desire for award winning gnocchi, spend your money at this restaurant.

The restaurant had a 5 star award , from 1997. The place itself is small , loud, not a place for a romantic dinner. The waiter was friendly, fast talker , sometimes difficult to understand in some occasions. My son ordered a soda and it was given to him 35 minutes later and he forgot to bring the appetizer. But the entrees were the right size and delicious. The desserts were very good, specially the chocolate Tartufo. The prices reasonable.

We had wanted to experience North Shore in San Francisco. The &quot;Little Italy&quot; of the city. My daughter-in-law said she knew just the place. Our son made reservations for a Thursday night. After first walking around a bit to get the flavor of the area we went into this funny little place. Once in the magic happened. I felt I was in an Italian place in maybe NYC not on the west coast. It was a fun dark family run place. The wait staff all spoke Italian to each other, but made their customers feel right at home. My husband was seated where he could see the what was going on at the bar and loved the scene. The food, service and atmosphere were wonderful. This place is not a &quot;slick&quot; as some of the others we passed by but I feel it was much more interesting. Check this out. We took a cab from our hotel to get there. But we walked back. Great time.

Firenze By Night was recommended to my husband and I on our first day in San Francisco. Our city tour guide, Dylan, said he thought it was the best Italian food in SF.We decided to walk in that night and Paolo greeted us immediately. The restaurant has a bar area on the right side, when you first walk in, and a dining area on the left. He took us right away to a table for two. We arrived right after they opened so there wasn't any wait and were only a few other people in the restaurant.I cannot say enough good things about the people here. All of the waiters were friendly and charming (they know how to work their authentic Italian accents!). They were helpful in explaining specials and giving time to order.Everything we ordered was simply amazing. They start out with bread and olive oil, of course, and we ordered an appetizer of tomatoes with fresh mozzarella. The presentation was beautiful and on the side there were dots of a basil pesto. We hadn't touched the pesto when the waiter came to clear the plate. We said he couldn't take it away without us trying it and suggested it for dipping with the bread. I am SO GLAD we suggested this. It ended up being one of my favorite things of our entire trip.For the entree, my husband ordered Veal Saltimbocca I decided to order the Gnocchi since the menu said it was &quot;Award Winning!&quot; I can definitely see why. It was the most amazing thing I have ever tasted. The fork slid through them like butter. My husband loved his dinner as well. I couldn't finish my gnocchi, not because it wasn't lovely but just because I was so full, so my husband finished it off. His reaction was the same as mine. Amazing!We ended up leaving extremely happy that we were referred there and couldn't stop talking about it.Because we had such a great experience, we decided to go back to Firenze By Night for our last dinner in San Francisco before leaving to catch our plane home.When we walked in, we were greeted, once again, by Paolo and shown to our table. He remembered us from a few nights before and said it was great to see us again. What a nice, friendly, touch. We felt so at home here.While we were looking over the menu trying to decide on a starter, Paolo had the back send out some Bruschetta for us to enjoy. It was such a great gesture and we really appreciated it. Tasty too! Since we had the Bruschetta already (which we were considering), we order the sausage stuffed mushrooms. I'm not a huge mushroom fan but these were delicious!We both ordered the same dinners as the previous time and they were just as great as before!As we were leaving the restaurant we stopped to tell Paolo how brilliant we thought the entire place was and that all restaurants and businesses should try to live up to their standards. He seemed genuinely happy about that and chatted with us for a few minutes. He asked if we had ever tried limoncello and had the bar tender give us each a shot glass of it. It was really great and so sweet of him to do!Again, we left extremely happy with our experience. If we are ever back in San Francisco, we will be dining here many more times and I recommend it to ANYONE who has the chance.THANK YOU SO MUCH to Paolo and all of the waiters and chef at Firenze By Night! You made our stay fantastic!!

It was not packed when we went for dinner but it was nearly full...the host saw our little one and lovingly seated us at their half booth table saying that she could lay down if she wanted (and he joked that we could get a bottle of wine while she napped). That gesture alone made me love this restaurant. Our server was from Italy and I could have listened to him speak to us all night. Darling. We follow the K.I.S.S ( keep it simple, stupid) policy at unfamiliar Italian restaurants and ordered a cheese and herb ravioli in meat sauce and a Pasta Pomodoro...both simple and delicious. Bread basket had fresh Italian and Foccacia (delicious), the atmosphere was great, and the service was excellent. Passed on dessert because wasn't sure if made in house.

Our hotel concierge recommended this place for dinner. Menu didn't have the signature dishes Italian restaurants should always have. Poor appetizer choices. Appetizer I asked for was not the appetizer I received. It just tried too hard to be authentic. It lacked taste and creativity. It was average Italian food at its best. The restaurant was empty and the bar area was crowded during dinnertime? Something is wrong. There are tons of GREATb Italian restaurants in San Francisco. This just happened to be not one of them. Our waiter looked like the parking attendent that stole the Ferrari in the movie Ferris Buellers Day Off.

We ate at this restaurant tonight. I had to get right onto TA and post this review. First, we should have left when we walked into the raucous restaurant. You have to walk through the super crowded loud bar that is filled with partiers. The atmosphere spills over into the restaurant. The owner's son (I know this because of an article framed on the wall) was gruff and rude when seating us. I almost walked out, but it was Saturday in San Francisco and our chances of getting a table anywhere at that point were slim. The waiter was EXTREMELY inattentive and his co-waiter was clearly unhappy, and rushed. They never made even the slightest attempt to make us feel welcome. The food was very pedestrian. The sauces were tasteless. With so many restaurants in San Francisco, find another one. We wished that we just ordered room service and skipped this one.

My husband and I treated another couple to dinner to thank them for being great hosts during our SF trip. We'd never been to Firenze, but a local friend had recommended it.Our friends arrived early. When we joined them, we were appalled to learn that the host refused to seat them and had asked them to wait outside in the cold, windy night until the rest of our party arrived. That's no way to treat new customers! It was a weeknight and the place was half-full.Firenze's poor hospitality put a damper on the rest of our evening. The gnocci was tasty, though not sublime, and the spinach salad and bruschetta were good. However, the decaf coffee tasted and looked like mud, even when I asked for a fresh cup. You can do better for your time and money.

We ate at Frienze on a Sunday night and had a great meal. We had three children with us and they loved their meals (they can be picky). I chose the veal and it was outstanding and my husband ordered the gnocchi which was delicious. We go out to dinner often in Manhattan and Firenze is not an upscale restaurant, but a welcoming place that delivers great Italian food. We had a bottle of wine/appetizers/dinner and dessert and this was one of our more inexpensive meals. We all loved it and would recommend for a fun night out. This is not the place for a romantic date.

My wife and I were in San Francisco for three nights and ate at Firenze the first night and enjoyed it so much we came back for the third night. The menu is broad with many pastas, veal, seafood and the daily specials are wonderful. I love veal and usually shy away from ordering it because hardly anyone can resist overcooking it and turning it into shoe leather. However, after talking to the waiter and expressing my concerns he assured me that it would be cooked properly and it was the best veal I have ever eaten. My wife had the Petrale Sole special and declared it the best piece of fish she has ever had. On alternate nights we both has pasta ( ravioli and Fusili ) and it was amazing. The service is very good and the owner, Sergio is on the floor and very involved to make sure everything is perfect. My only compliant is that the wine prices ate a bit too high with the least expensive bottle at $32. Anyway, dinner for two with a shared salad and a shared tiramisu and a bottle of wine was around $100 with tax and tip. We did a lot of pre trip restaurant searching on Yelp and we are very glad we chose Firenze.

The food here is definitely above-average: the pasta was properly cooked, and the dishes were tasty and well-executed. But was it mind-blowingly-good? No.The atmosphere is nice, even if it feels just a little dated. The service was excellent. The waiter was attentive and the food arrived very quickly.I do have one beef with this place, however: I ordered a Bombay Sapphire &amp; tonic, and when I received the bill, I noticed that I had been charged $8 for Sapphire and $4 for tonic water. Seriously?I'm okay with paying $12 for a cocktail--it's SF and I understand prices are going to be high--but breaking the drink down and billing me for its parts is imperious and a good reason to never return.Looking back, I'm just thankful I didn't order a long island tea.

Firenze by Night is a family owned Italian restaurant near the convergence of Chinatown and North Beach in San Francisco.In a sense, it is a step back in time; large bar, dimly lit, crowded dining room and a busy, noisy atmosphere.Dinner for two started with the generously sized antipasto platter, followed by the stracciatella, or Italian egg drop soup. A well prepared osso bucco and handmade gnocchi rounded out the menu.Bill for two nearly $120 with wine. Remember this is San Francisco; tame your budget expectations.Pros: Well prepared cuisine, friendly, competent service., fun, old school atmosphere.Cons: Some may find it small, dark and noisy; OK, but you'd have to pay much more for peace and quiet.All in all, a good value for a real quality sit down meal a bit away from the tourist trap restarants on Columbus.

Firenze by Night, 1429 Stockton St, [--]. Open 7 days.Menu posted at[--] The food could not have been better, and all the waiters were Italian, so charming goes without saying. One of the house specialties was Gnocchi Firenze ( in a light tomato sauce), and the gnocchi were so light they practically floated off the plate. We also chatted with our table neighbors and just had a great time. Reserve a day or two in advance.

This is a family owned Italian restaurant that was recommended by the convention center staff. I went for dinner mid-week without reservations and it was quite busy but I only had to wait about 10 minutes. The menu offers a wide range of classic and specialty fare. The staff is extremely attentive and it's easy to see why it is such a popular place. The food was very good, although I would probably make a different selection on my next visit.

My husband and i were on vacation in SF just last week. We had a terrible experience at Caffe Macaroni ( see that review if you are planning to go there) and a local recommended Firenze by Night. It is off Columbus Ave on Stockton.THIS PLACE IS A HIDDEN GEM! We ate there twice and Paolo, the owner`s son, was extremely nice and accommodating. He apologized for the bad experience that we had at Caffe Macaroni just because he felt bad of the image they had created for all Italian restaurants in North Beach. The meals were delightful, the gnocchi are as Italian as they get- they melt in your mouth! Paolo let us try their Pappardelle in rabbit sauce- Yummy! Don`t forget to try some of their homemade Limoncello- it is delicious!I loved this restaurant, their food and their service! It was the best culinary experience we had in San Francisco! I would recommend it to the most discriminating connoisseurs!
