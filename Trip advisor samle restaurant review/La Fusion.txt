My husband and I ordered the mixed green salad, a baked empanada, fried yucca, and arroz con pollo. We were really full! Everything was really delicious, but I would probably skip the salad next time and go for something else. It was good and I wanted something fresh, but I should have saved room for something else that I can't always get. The fried yucca was a little different. It seemed like it was mashed and then fried -- different than the kind we've had in South America. However, it tasted really good. Normal fried yucca can be a sort of dry and this wasn't. The dippings sauces for it were good too. The arroz con pollo was very tasty. Great flavor. The empanada tasted very authentic and was also good. It has raisins, so it definitely has a sweet taste to it. The servers here were really nice, but slow. However, we weren't in a rush so it wasn't a problem for us. I was thirsty and wished they brought out water sooner, but I could have asked for it sooner too.

I was looking for something a bit different for dinner one evening, and when I saw the menu for this place, I knew I had to try it. I popped in on a Wednesday evening around 7:00 after exploring Chinatown, and they were pretty busy. I didn't have a reservation, and had to wait about ten minutes before capturing someone's attention to ask if I could just sit at the bar (I was by myself). They said sure, but they needed to clean off a spot first. No big deal.I'm glad I didn't give up when I saw how busy they were - my entree was fantastic! I had the Lomo Saltado, which I love, and they did it to perfection.My meal was kind of pricey ($25 for the entree and $14 for a glass of wine), but I guess that's San Francisco.

This is a very strongly reviewed restaurant in a very convenient location only a few minutes walk from the Montgomery BART station. We came here for lunch, coming away with mixed results. The restaurant itself looks appealing, and has nice energy. Service was extremely slow, and it looks like they were a bit short-staffed on the day we were there.The food was very inconsistent. I had the seafood pot pie. On the one hand, seafood cooking quality and presentation were superb. On the other hand, the dish was very bland and lacking in seasoning and balance. For a menu that appears to be strongly influenced by Peruvian cuisine, that is very unexpected.The other problem was the price. Dishes that I would normally see at $15-$18 dollars such as lomo saltado were in the mid-$20's here. At this price point, I expected far more.La Fusion appears to be a place with good potential, but I have had much better Latin American food in the SF Bay Area at lower price levels.

This restaurant was amazing on every level - food, drinks, service and ambience. Couldn't fault it - we went as family of 5 (kids 17, 14, 11) and we all loved it. Ribs and chicken starters - fab; rotisserie chicken with sides - spot on. Thanks for a great night!

We decided to try this small spot on a whim and did not regret it. We didn't have a reservation and thought we would be ok since it was before 7pm. The hostess squeezed us in. So I suggest making one for ease and assurance. Dress is casual and the small kitchen is in full view. The price is mid priced. Our meal was $72 which we thought was good.They only serve beer and wine and a house sangria. My husband had two glasses of the sangria and thought it was not as surgery sweet as it can be. A plus.We started with s veggie and a beef empanada. They were delicious. And the chimichurri sauce was fantastic. For our meals, my husband had the arroz con pollo and loved it. I had the quarter pound chicken. It was served on a bed of large croutons. The chicken was as promised...delicious. We also split a side of the truffle Mac and cheese. So good.Definitely a great idea and a great meal.

This is a fairly small restaurant but clearly popular- full both times we visited and had early and late sittings on most tables.

Mixed feelings

Mixed feelings about this restaurant. The location is convenient, it's pretty small, but has a pleasant atmosphere. Took relatives from Switzerland there. The gentlemen in our party both ordered the lomo saltado. Both were a bit disappointed: what looked like a hearty helping of beef tenderloin was just a few scant strips covering the fries underneath. The women ordered the seafood pot pie and rotisserie chicken - both did not disappoint. We also had dessert - empanadas and flan- both excellent. Besides the beef tenderloin plates, THE most disappointing part was: after our dessert, we were sitting and chatting. The server came to us and kicked us out! She stated that there are people waiting for the table so we needed to leave. We truly were not there that long after dessert. I was so embarrassed! One of the relatives from Switzerland stated &quot;only in America!&quot; I assured him this is not the norm. We left on an unfortunate, bad note.So the bottom line? Go for the pot pie, but don't linger. You will get the boot!!!

We saw this on Trip Advisor and the positive reviews are accurate. The food was unusual and very tasty and the service was excellent. There was a real buzz about the place and although we raised the average age by quite a lot the atmosphere was great! The staff seemed to be a really happy team and the service was efficient and very friendly. It's a small restsurant in the financial district so probably not a bad idea to book.

Based on other reviews, we made a reservation and had dinner at La Fusion. The place is small yet we never felt crowded. The bartender/host was super friendly and got us set up with the house sangria which is wonderful. We ordered some fried empanadas and tuna tartar for appetizers. Delicious!! Good thing we did not over indulge on appetizers as most of us had the roasted chicken for dinner, It is fantastic! It is served over warm, sourdough croutons with and arugula salad. Super moist. The mac and cheese side was a big hit as was the white bean cassoulet. Highly recommend.

When I first walked in on an early Thursday eve, I thought about leaving, small, non-extensive menu...but my good companion said, Hang. It's gonna be bret, so we stYed, and I've gotta say, as one whise reviewed many, MANY, eateries for this site, this was maybe one of the best, and most fun dining experience I've had in some time. Got there just before 6, and it started filling up. We decided we'd just have wine and some appetizers and it soon turned into a fusion-taps epic. We started with the shrimp ceviche, did the fried empenada and the larger beef , baked epenada appetizers, and just kept going, splitting eveerything. We then had the crispy chicken appetizer and a side of Cassoulet, and finaly their pork rib appetizer. Each of thse small plates were EXQUISITE with excellent, house-made sauces. LISTEN: The sauce with those fall off the bone pork ribs was among the best I have ever tasted. This is coming from a foodie critic that has dined on most continents. BBQ/chocolate divinity it was. I am raving about this small, unassuming little bistro because, by god, it desereves it. As if our many plated feast was not enough, we finished with the banana empenadas with con leche. Please, Go there, split a bunch of small plates, and tell me it was not worth every, reasonably priced dollar you spent. Bon Appetito my friends, Bon Appetito.

The Salvadoran owner is jolly, and the food arrived quickly. Not much, but the quality is very good. If you are craving Peruvian-style ceviche, this is an excellent option. I've gone twice thus far, and both times the window above the main entrance was wide open -- many guests were visibly freezing. Ask the hostess to close it, and she will!

My sisters and I visited San Francisco and ended up coming here based off of some yelp ratings since we were already in the area during dinner time. They had no room for us and the wait was an hour. However, the hostess called someone with a reservation who was late and turned out they weren't coming so she seated us right away. She was SO nice and friendly and helpful. Before we knew we could get seated, she gave us several recommendations of her favorite places to eat in the area that we could go check out. Once we were seated, one of the kitchen staff came out to greet us and I asked him about the cheese being pasteurized (pregnant) and he went to the back and checked himself because he said he wanted to make doubly sure he told me the correct information. Our server was so pleasant and friendly and kept our drinks filled and did a great job. The hostess came back to see how we were doing and gave us recommendations on what to order. Then we talked to her again after our meal. My sisters ordered ceviche and I ordered the chicken salad sandwich with a side of sweet potato fries. It was very good! I definitely think it was worth the visit for the food, but the best part for us was the friendly, helpful, warm nature of every staff member we encountered. It definitely ups the overall experience. I would recommend this place, definitely!

This is a solid option in the financial district. I arrived around 6:00 and it was empty, filled up by 6:30 so you might consider a reservation. Nothing particularly fancy here, and the place is very small. I had the rotisserie chicken with mac n cheese and it was very good. Pricing was decent, with 1/2 chicken and side around $20. Reasonable selection of beer and wine. Waitress was efficient and quite pleasant. I will eat here again.

I was recommended to this place by my in-laws who were in San Francisco back in may. My wife and I were in San Francisco last week to celebrate our anniversary and gave it a shot. The place itself looked really nice! I ordered a Ceviche and my wife Arroz con Pollo. Her rice was good but the chicken tasted a little undercooked and not very flavorful. My ceviche however was really good! It was different than other ceviches I had but I enjoyed every bite. I also asked them to not serve me octopus and they did it without an issue. The place is a little pricey...I would go back and try other dishes for sure but I would skip the chicken or at least try that dish only for the rice!

Went to La Fusion during a business trip to SF. This place was wonderful! In particular, I enjoyed the empanadas (as a starter and dessert) and the sauces that came with the rotisserie chicken.

All in all, a great meal.

hubby went here the night before with work and raved about the food. So, he took me there the next night. Probably, some of the best food in San Francisco. My hubby is allergic to shellfish but was still able to try most of the ceviche. The presentation was amazing. We tried the trio sampler which was large enough for us to share. Folks around us commented on the beautiful dish. The addition of the fried corn (kinda like corn nuts) and the soft white beans added so much extra texture that you just kept going back for more. Folks around us got the macaroni and cheese and raved about it. All the dishes looked fantastic.

First of all get a reservation. The place is small and busy. Understandable with the great food they serve. Living in Latin America I've eaten a lot of great ceviches and the one they serve here ranks at the top of my list. The Fusion Seafood Pot Pie, was delicious. The crust was nice and flaky. My wife really enjoyed her ribs. The waiter was very attentive and knowledgable about the food and wines they had.Best of all the prices are decent for a SF restaurant and the quality of food and service.Bottom line, very enjoyable evening meal, well attended in a nice atmosphere.

We came for dinner on a Friday night, and luckily had made reservations because it was packed. We tried some of their staples, and our server was very helpful in assisting us with our order and getting a mix/portions right. We had the roasted chicken, a couple different empanadas, a couple different ceviches, and the truffle mac n cheese. Everything was good, but the mac n cheese and ceviches were the highlight for us. The restaurant is very small, with tables packed in pretty tightly so it was noisy and unfortunately the guests seated at the table next to us were especially loud and obnoxious. Obviously this can happen anywhere, but it took away a bit from an otherwise great atmosphere.

Two co-workers and I ate here for lunch in December 2014. Fortunately, we had a reservation because this place is very small - less than 10 tables. Make a reservation, even for lunch to make sure that you can get in.Our server was very friendly and efficient. We ordered a few empanadas to start which came out split. That was a nice touch since there were three of us wanting to try everything. The beef empanadas were good. I didn't get to try any of the others since my co-workers quickly inhaled them. The chimichurri on the side was really tasty. We also got a side of the truffle mac and cheese, which probably added about 5 pounds to me but was worth every bite.Based on the recommendation of the server, I got the rotisserie chicken. It came over a warm bread salad (think greens with enormous croutons). I also got a side of fries, although with the size of the quarter chicken I got, I didn't need anything else. The chicken was flavorful and moist. I had a few of the fries and they were average. I was too full after the mac and cheese anyway.The only downside was that our table was super close to where the chefs were making the food and as a result, we were overwhelmed with the smell of grease at times. Otherwise, I was pretty happy with my lunch here.

There was not a table empty on Friday night as we walked in to our reserved table. You had to raise your voice to get through to the rest of the group, as the energetic young crowd shared the latest news on cool apps and exciting IPOs to watch.We shared the signature chicken dish--very tender but not very flavorful--served with three types of helpful sauces in minimal amounts. The sweet potato fries were good, as was a green mixed salad. The wine selection was limited but low-priced.

So, we went for their famous rotisserie chicken and while the dark meat was good, the white meat was dry and tasteless. The red garlicky sauce helped, but the chicken was a disappointment. It comes with some greasy toasted bread cubes and greens. On the other hand, my sister and brother-in-law ordered different ceviches and they looked and apparently tasted wonderful. The waitresses were resale nice and the place was busy the whole time we were there. It's right next door to a cigar store and if you're sensitive to cigar smoke, don't sit near the front door.

Someone recommended we try this place. We were going to - almost an hour before closing, and the restaurant did what was most convenient for them - turned us away, saying they were only doing carry out. It's OK because the dining room looked cramped and the decor did not at all match the fancy dishes photographed on the website. I wouldn't want to eat that stuff in a carry-out container anyway. Oh, and it's right next door to a cigar bar, so you smell stinky cigar smoke. Enjoy.

We had lunch at La Fusion and had a very enjoyable time! Great food and value!Between four, as an appy we ordered the ceviche mixto, which was really delicious (picture included). I've never had peruvian ceviche, the major difference I noticed was the presentation and the accompaniments. There was great acidity and a nice salty kick which was perfect for ceviche, and came with crackers, large corn granules and little crunchy corn bits.We ordered the full roast chicken (which comes on a warm bread salad) and a side of veggies. The warm bread salad was delicious, I could have eaten just a bowl of that.Overall, highly recommend!

Enjoyed a meal at La Fusion with colleagues, and we were all wowed by the variety in the menu, and the lovely service! La Fusion is in a very small space, so get reservations ahead of time if you can (particularly important if you are a party greater than 2). The kitchen is open to the dining space, so you'll see and hear your meal being completed for you.Particular highlights were the ceviche, lomo saltado starter, and rotisserie chicken, which we shared across the table with a variety of sides. What a nice treat to stumble across this location, and our server was gracious, attentive, and had wonderful recommendations for our meal (all of which we took with enthusiasm.) Absolutely worth a visit.

Getting to La Fusion was supposed to be straightforward, but I entirely missed their sign. It is a small cozy restaurant with about 12 tables and we sat next to the kitchen. Busy as it was, I could experience the different flavors. We had a ceviche mixto for an appetizer and I had the mushroom wrap - was quite healthy and delicious. Service was pretty quick, even though a friend ordered the lamb shank, which he thoroughly enjoyed. Will return next time I am in SFO.

We visited La Fusion on our first night in San Francisco. I had read a few good reviews, liked the look of the menu and thought it was worth a try. The restaurant isn't big, but it has a vibrant atmosphere and the staff are super friendly. I started with the beef empanada which was full of rich gravy and chunky steak. The accompanying salsas were also fantastic! I followed this with the pork tenderloin. The pork was cooked perfectly and worked well with the salsa verde. But the star of the show was the tacu tacu which accompanied it. A fried rice and bean cake packed with flavour. Seriously delicious! We finished with a glass of port and a pleasant chat with one of the servers about his travels in London. Definitely check this place out if you go to SF.

One of the strongest sangrias I've ever had.2. Half rotisserie chicken on bread salad, 16~Really good. Everything was prepared nicely, and the three sauces complemented very well. I would have liked my chicken skin just a tad crispier. Also, one of my pieces of bread was so hard I couldn't even cut it with my knife.3. Truffle mac and cheese side, 3~Mediocre. I couldn't taste much of the truffle, and the cheese congealed really fast. Only ate about half of it.Service was good. I'll probably be coming here a lot in the future. I was absolutely stuffed afterwards, so I'd recommend not getting the half chicken unless you're sharing.

We had just gotten to San Francisco, (day one of our romantic road trip down the coast) and we were looking for a nice romantic place to kick off our journey. La Fusion was close by and surrounded by many other restaurants, luckily, we still chose to go in. We had the sangria, (which was probably the BEST sangria I've ever tasted!) and had the chicharron de pollo as an appetizer. Being Latin, I have made chicharron de pollo many times and have claimed it to be the best however, I think theirs was better lol! It was delicious! My boyfriend had the chicken sandwich and I had the quarter chicken meal with a salad. We also ordered the truffle mac and cheese as a side (divine!). Our food was amazing! Latin food seems to be a bit difficult to class up being that it's mostly comfort food, but La Fusion did an amazing job at making it look so elegant and taste magnificent! It was delicious and I was surprised how affordable it was! It was a great find and I will definitely go back if I'm ever in San francisco again!

Will not disappoint. The menu was simple but every dish was well presented and prepared. The appetizers including ceviche and empanadas were to die for. We ordered rotisserie chicken, lomito and the seafood pie and each dish was tasty and well done. We want to give credit to the staff who were attentive, friendly and were clearly having a great time. I highly recommend this restaurant and we will definitely come back here on future trips to San Francisco.

Wonderful Latin!!

Had a great meal. Started with empanadas. They were excellent. Had lamb shank and 1/2 a chicken. Both were great. Also great was truffle mac and cheese. I highly recommend this place!!!

Looked on Tripadvisor and found this restaurant close to where we were staying on Grant Avenue. It is on the edge of Chinatown and the Financial District. It is small and stylishly modern. The lady who served us was very welcoming and helpful in describing the dishes. The food achieved something many more expensive restaurants fail to do, which is to create dishes where the spices enhance the flavour of the ingredients rather than overpower them. We spoke with one of the chefs who was obviously very enthusiastic and proud of what they were trying to do. We were in the USA for a month and this was our best meal. Great meal. They deserve support

Just past Belden Place (a cute little alley of restaurants), on Pine St., this small comfortable place was a great find. The server was knowledgable and friendly, as well as sympathetic to my flight plight (cancellations and delays). The rotisserie chicken was top notch, as were the side dishes. The warm bread salad was soooo tasty. The arroz con choclo (extra large Peruvian corn kernels) was exactly as I had it in Peru. I added a Cuzqueno beer to make a perfect Peruvian meal. And it very reasonably priced!

We had a fantastic meal at this small restaurant. Walked in off the street, walking back to our hotel (the Omni, another great place). It is small but smelled great, and was cozy warm after the windy, cool May winds. They have a ceviche specialty and a whole list that all sounded wonderful - we chose to share the Mixto, a combination of cod, octopus, shrimp and squid, and it was fabulous. We had the chicken and the rib special - both were done to perfection. And the dessert empanade was simply to die for. Prices are reasonable, service was excellent, and the sangria made it a perfect evening. Highly recommended!

Fabulous food in the Financial District

This is a great foodie experience. Despite what anyone else might say, the rotisserie chicken is out of this world. I love chicken in almost every form it takes and I'm still dreaming about the crunchy skin and succulent meat that fell off the bone onto my plate. How can I do that at home? Anyway, we also had the lamb shank which was equally tender and flavorful...just not the best chicken in town! The prices are demure, particularly for SFO and the service is friendly and knowledgeable. Oh yeah...have a glass of the sangria...ummmm

Highly recommended

Interesting, unique menu. It was very tasty and prices are affordable. It is a small restaurant, but feels very cozy. Whatever you order try mac and cheese. Every day of the week is very busy, threfore call and make reservation.

Great find - delicious food

Wonderful find. The ceviche was spectacular. As was the roasted chicken and bread salad - nice, tasty and juicy. Lomo saltado was also very good. The most decadent indulgence was the truffle Mac - double up on your Lipitor and order it - delicious. The place is small so it fills up quickly - reservations are recommended.

What a surprise!

Friend made reservations for our party of 6 at this little restaurant. It is a wonderfully warm and friendly place serving the most delicious food. Of our party of six, we tasted many of the items on the menu and honestly, they were all just awesome. And very reasonable prices - very affordable. Surprisingly affordable! I highly recommend this place. It's not a 5-star restaurant in terms of ambiance or location or view - no - it's a 5 star restaurant in terms of delicious food. I can't wait to go back.

Scrumptious and Original

Loved our dinner and overall experience here, while vacationing in San Fran. The mostly peruvian dishes are given an unexpected twist, with sauces or presentation. Had the tomato soup, which was delicious but just a tad too salty. The chicken had a wonderful flavor and was prepared to perfection. The fries on the side were great. Also, we had three dipping sauces to choose from. Reminded me of the flavors of Peru.

Great in the middle of Financial District

DELICIOUS!! This is the best sangria in the city so far. I love coming here!They specialize in rotisserie chicken but they also have several other great dishes like ceviche, empanadas and also the mac and cheese! We love the bread salad as well!It's a small intimate and casual place. Great for friends or a date. You have to be patient and go early for lunch because they are really busy and they have a small but very friendly staff.
