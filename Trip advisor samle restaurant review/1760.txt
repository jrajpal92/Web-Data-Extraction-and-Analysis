Greeted by a friendly, helpful waitress who explained the menu and that the best way to for the four of us to order was modified family style..... and she would bring things to us in the right order. We started with the avocado toast and the little gem salad. Both were excellent, and arrived in timely fashion. We also ordered the burger and, the best of everything, the duck burger. There was a bit of a wait, but the duck burger was well worth the wait. While eating the burgers, the brussels sprouts arrived. But then the real waiting began.The kitchen here is open to the dining room. Before we realized the extent of the problem, we commented on the fact that the kitchen staff seemed very laid back. We had no idea. I've never seen a kitchen with less hustle. In fact, they were chatting, standing around.... no evidence of cooking, plating, serving..... ha!. After a 30 minute wait, we were told that the pork belly dish was no longer available. During this time period NOTHING was going on in the kitchen. We were encouraged to substitute the ribs for the pork belly, because the ribs were ready. We did. And then we waited another 20 minutes. The ribs arrived, but not the fries that we had ordered. They came later.While the waitress apologized, it was half hearted. She said the kitchen was busy. Really? WE saw no evidence of that. Then, after all the waiting, nothing.... not even a glass of wine was comped . Really bad form.Overall, very disappointing.

Great food and atmosphere.

I sat at the bar for a light evening meal as I was travelling solo. Service was great, the bartender was helpful and knowledgeable about the food and drinks menu with lots a recommendations. It had a really nice relaxed atmosphere and far from the typical american food I was used to after the previous 6 days in Vegas. Something I was told about, and I can verify, about San Francisco as a whole! I went for a scallop dish and was presented with an amuse-bouche prior to receiving this, something I wasn't expecting, but a nice touch! It was really tasty, well presented food, and for a reasonable price. You'll be looking at twice the price for the same in London! I gave 5 as I cant fault what I experienced and the value for money was superb.

We have been to this little gem several times in the past. I was reluctant to write a review as we wanted to keep the place to ourselves, but they have been so consitently good for so long, I could not wait any longer.Decor is clean and crisp. Basically a bar, a dining room and a semi open kitchen in the back. There is a sharing table in addition to regular tables and booths. When full, the noise level is above average, but not offensive.Cocktails are all top notch (as you would expect in an upscale SF restaurant). Wine list is actually punching above its weight class given the relatively small size of the place. Kudos to the team for having a thoughtful selection of non-California wines.Food is all amazing. Its really a small plates place, and they organize the menu in a lighter to heavier format, which helps dial in the right ordering strategy. The menu works both for a quick bite at the bar or for a nice night out with your significant other. Its that flexible.

Went for an early dinner after a movie on Sunday. The decor of the restaurant is sleek and modern. We had a tasting menu of about six courses between us. Each one was delicious. Beef tatare, pork, gem salad with a delicious creamy dressing, baby fried potatoes, everything was superb. I had a good rose wine, French not Californian. All in all, an excellent experience, and will visit again the next time I am in San Francisco. Reasonable price too.

Headed off here with a group of work colleagues one of the group had tried brunch on a previous occasion. Was for dinner this time around. Arrived around 7.15 and the place was full up but we got shown to our table straight away. Restaurant is nicely decorated in a loft style seating very comfortable and tables about the right size, our group was 5. Kitchen is open to the restaurant which I like (looked spotless) and there was a lot of ordered activity and I could observe good coordination between wait staff and dispatch. The main focus is on &quot;family style&quot; food offering so made to share.. a decent selection of dishes on the menu ordered from smallest to largest so you could work out easily enough how much to order. We decided on sharing some first courses and having a larger dish as a main each. We had some delicious olives, avocado toast with radish, pickles and lime was very tasty. The Hamachi crudo with lemon and cucumber was very good, we also tried the fingerling potatoes which everybody thought were amazing. Baby potatoes with charred avocado pieces peanuts and fresh coriander.. wow!. I had the Bavette steak which was really good medium rare plenty of it and very tasty. I tried the lobster risotto which packed a great flavour and the pork sisig crunchy cubes of pork with lots of other stuff in it... was very nice. Rounded of by sharing some honey panna cotta which was delicious. Wines are a little on the expensive side starting at around 50$.. but the sommelier was very attentive and found a lovely sauvignon blanc at the cheaper end of the list. Service was top notch and the wait staff knowledgeable and always there when needed.. was a most enjoyable night and would certainly repeat again. Poland street is a little off the beaten track but a nice area with some other interesting restaurants to try out..

Awkward and uncomfortable since the communal table only has backless stools!Food was good - some dishes better than others - really liked the cavatelli pasta, and fried mushrooms.This tapas dinner took 5 hours - crazy!we had put our entire order in and the dishes came out one type at a time - the waitstaff didn't seem worried.

This restaurant was a definite high spot during our trip to San Francisco. We arrived on time for our reservation but did have to wait a short time...not an unexpected thing at a popular restaurant on a Saturday night. Service was excellent here...prompt and efficient without being over-bearing. I was delighted to find they offered Veuve Clicquot rose by the glass, although a bit steep at $19. The dishes are all offered tapas style, and our group of four happily shared 6-7. Among the best were the beef tartare, the pork sisig, the Brussels sprouts, and the rosemary focaccia. For dessert, my husband and I shared an amazing milk chocolate &quot;ganache&quot;, a beautiful presentation of chocolate, hickory ice cream, bourbon caramel and marshmallow. Divine!

the restaurant industry is brutal. tough to ensure every serving to every customer is perfectly prepared, tough to ensure every staff interaction is top drawer, impossible to have every dish delight everyone's different tastes. can't say 1760 will be perfect for everyone every time. can say that, visiting SF for a few days, we liked our experience so much on a crowded Friday evening that we back for more, on a quiet Sunday. both times, terrific higher-end varied meal and capable service (thank you Cassidy). interesting to experience the buzz of an Nob Hill &quot;in place&quot; one night and the relaxed feel of a neighbourhood restaurant the next.

We went for brunch on a Saturday. The drink specials were good. We got a few bottles of champagne and various juices to make our own brunch cocktails. The portions were quite small. I think it's meant to be shared (tapas style). I had this egg avocado dish. It was quite good.

This place has one of the most hip, creative, and just amazing menus you'll find. We went there with some friends for my wife's birthday and were treated to just an amazing mix of tapas/family style plates with incredibly delicious and unique pairings of flavors and textures. Wow. The cocktails, are amazing. Our waitress was perfect, super professional and happy to banter with you and made excellent recommendations. We asked her about the chef and she simply referred to him as Carl (I don't think she knew his last name) and he came out to us and said hello and was just the nicest, most modest and simply talented chef I've ever met. Chefs that produce this sort of food usually come with egos as big as the city, but this guy was as humble as they come. The restaurant is located in a nice little neighborhood on Polk Street. It was recommended to us by our concierge at the Intercontiental... and of the 100's of restaurants I've eaten at in SF this takes the cake. Outstanding. I hope it is there fore years to come. We'll be back.

I went here with 2 other friends as it was easy to get a last minute reservation and had a nice table by the window. The atmosphere of the restaurant was nice with a good volume. The service was also good and the water was very friendly. We ordered five plats for the 3 of us and only one plate wowed us. This was the Calamarata Pasta. Then we ordered the focaccia which was disappointing. To ensure we did not leave hungry we got the chicken. This was good but for half a chicken the price was not worth it.We each got 3 different cocktails and these were well done and for the price good.

A New San Francisco Classic

1760, the new offering from the team at Acquerello, knocks the cover off the ball with this new offering in Russian Hill.Upon entering, diners will be impressed with the high ceilings and airy design. Wonderful natural light and soothing colors serve to enhance the dining experience.The eclectic menu is influenced by Italy (naturally, since the team is from Acquerello), Asia, and Latin America. The team strives to find the best, natural ingredients and to skillfully treat them to allow the intrinsic quality, flavors, and textures to be expressed.The shishito peppers ($9), with Castelvetrano olive oil, hazelnuts, and smoked sea salt, are a good way to awaken your taste buds. With roasted peanuts, avocado, and potatoes, the octopus ($18) is grilled to a crispy goodness. Celery root, salsa verde, and Meyer lemon complement the fall-off-the-bone tender beef short ribs ($24). With slaw, pickles, and spicy aioli, the fried duck sandwich ($16) is all that a sandwich should be: crispy, spicy, salty, rich, and a little greasy--yum.The service was friendly and prompt. Dishes arrive quickly, but diners do not feel rushed. There is a good selection of wines and cocktails, and with reasonable selections available by the bottle, 1760 does not forget beer aficionados.Worth a trip across The City, 1760 is on the verge of becoming a new classic.

Both in its artful presentation and fusion of flavors, their small tapas plates were delicious. Best if shared with others so that you can taste more varieties. Stars include lobster ceviche, ravioli, spicy ribs and deep fried squash blossoms. Duck sandwich with coleslaw was tasty but I think I would have preferred more full flavored duck confit or crispy duck leg rather than a meatloaf blend of duck. Seating is tightly packed and noisy. Wait staff very charming and accommodating. Truly a delight to the senses! Kudos to the chef!

A return visit for us quickly proved to be an excellent choice. The heirloom tomatoes were delicious, followed by perfectly prepared tempura squash blossoms- Yumm! The house gin is lightly infused and delicious with tonic- I can't wait to return to try it as a martini. But by far the star of the evening was the fried duck sandwich- good ahead and order two... You will get another for the road, guaranteed! Don't be disappointed if you can't try everything on the menu, save a few things for your return visits!

A Complete Experience

I have had the pleasure of dining at 1760 three times now. My husband and I were in the city for the weekend and I decided to take him to 1760 to try something new. 1760 is small and has a boisterous young crowd. You can try to get reservations, but you most likely won't succeed. If not that is okay, I've been three times without reservations, but have never waited more than 30 minutes for a table. It is not the kind of place that you would go with crowds or for big celebrations but for a unique dining experience as a couple or small group of friends (3-4) it is great. There are individual tables, bar seating and a communal table that probably seats about 20. The servers are knowledgeable about all of the menu offerings, they ask up front if you have any food allergies or sensitivities. It is a small plate multi-course type of dinner where one dish will come out at a time to give you time to love it, hate it for being gone and fervently wish for the next course to arrive. On this latest trip we were started off with the complimentary &quot;bruschetta&quot; which is an impossibly tiny crostini with a cheese mouse, peach/mango salsa and an herb which explodes with flavor in your mouth. We had the beef tartar, which is the best that I have had hands down. Next up was the fingerling potatoes, which is pared with avocado and chili peanuts. I know.....I know......it sounds crazy but wait til you try it. After that came the finger tender ribs which actually fall off of the bone in your fingers! Although we were stuffed we found room for the chicken and the heavenly aji verde sauce......oh the sauce. I've never made it through dinner with enough room for dessert but this time I was determined so convinced my husband to try the plaintains......I won't ruin the surprise for you here.....try them, you will find out when they get to the table that this isn't your average banana. Great food, good atmosphere, awesome service and tasty drinks.....stop by and party like its 1760!

The all small plates menu has some great choices. I was surprised which dishes I loved. The night began with an amuse bouche of squid ink rice with a mushroom cream. This was so amazing we asked if they could make us a full dish, but unfortunately they did not have enough squid ink. We ordered the carrots twice they were so good. I don't know how these baby carrots were transformed into the amazing flavor and texture they were, but I was pleasantly surprised. The toasted farro and cilantro-mint dip paired perfectly with the carrots. The Brussels sprouts were not good, so we used the cilantro-mint from the carrots to improve them. They were flavorless and a bit mushy. The lobster ceviche was perfect. The fried duck sandwhich had too much going on. The thousand island style dressing and slaw, as well as the heavy breaking overwhelmed any flavor of the duck. The chocolate ganache (a play on smores) was a good ending to the meal. Lots of options but with drinks ended up about $100 a person.

This was an excellent space for meeting with friends and to catch up in a popular, well lit, alive restaurant. Tapas style, which is not my favorite - so this may be your place if you like the tapas sharing experience. However, the choices were a bit too exotic, and the portion size often disappointing (think postage stamp for some items) - and not enough for the five people to always share. However, the chicken main dish made up for all other issues - delicious, fresh, special. Great wine selection.

What a fabulous place and right in my neighborhood! The varied and interesting menu makes choices difficult, because they all sound fabulous. The way I deal with that problem is to keep going back to try something I 'Missed' last time. And have been there several times and have ALWAYS been pleased. LOVE IT. Their 'stirring hour' from opening at 5:00 PM until 6:00 PM is a great bargain and offers, cocktails and wine, along with several menu items at a super discount.The steward is excellent and the waiters are superb. That along with fabulous food makes 1760 a MUST...

This restaurant was a hit! I met a friend for dinner here, and loved everything about this restaurant. We did not have a reservation, so we ate at the bar. The bartenders were super friendly and very helpful. Everything that they suggested off of the menu was fantastic! I had the 1760 signature drink, which had cumin in it and was quite tasty and &quot;different'. My friend had a drink with a compari ice cube in it and interesting spices. We also ordered 3 dishes to share - the crispy octopus (my favorite), brussel sprouts (yummy) and the pork ribs (delicious). The food is amazing. We also ordered the milk chocolate - deconstructed &quot;smores&quot; type dessert, and it was amazingly delicious,too! Dinner ran about $95 for two before tip. The restaurant itself has a good vibe and modern,yet comfortable decor. It was located a quick 15 minute walk from where I was staying in Nob Hill. My friend and I were quite full after sharing three dishes and a dessert. I will definitely go back to 1760 when I am in San Francisco again.

1760 is without doubt one of the finest dining/craft cocktail restaurants we have visited in San Francisco. Sit at the bar and have the &quot;mixologist&quot; fix you any cocktail you want and eat their amazing appetizers for a light dinner or dine in their dining room. My husband wanted a special cocktail using ingredients that would be found in Armenia. Christopher (bar manager) looked it up on his computer and created a drink that was unforgettable. GO--you will not regret being there.

I had dinner here while in town for work last month, and as I was solo for the night I sat at the bar (which I do often since I travel a lot). This place has been open a few months and it was on my list of restaurants to check out in SF. I really like the interior design, it's warm colors and high ceilings are very inviting, and there is good energy from the staff and diners. The windows are big and invite passers-by to come inside.I sat at the bar around 9pm on a Wednesday night and the place was bustling. The bartender welcomed me right away. I ordered their signature 1760 cocktail and it's REALLY GOOD. Very refreshing blend of mezcal, gin, mint and tonic with a little cumin to add spice.Since I was solo, I had to restrain myself ordering food. I started with some fried shishito peppers that were seasoned with toasted hazelnuts and really flavorful olive oil. Nice munchables for sharing or solo. I also ordered two other dishes for a little &quot;surf and turf&quot; - grilled pork ribs with hoisin-orange BBQ sauce followed by bucatini with uni, garlic and pepper. Both dishes were outstanding, and I had to forgo the 5th rib in order to save room for the pasta. The bucatini is a &quot;primi&quot; portion but very rich in flavor and texture. Perfect.The wine list is fun and adventurous, featuring some great domestic wineries and many from other countries. The list was definitely put together to go with the food.Check it out, it's a great new addition to the SF dining scene!

We had not been to San Francisco for a while so we wanted to try something new. I read about 1760 and I am so glad we ate here, a truly memorable meal. Great vibe and decor in the wonderful Nob Hill neighborhood. We can especially recommend the corn ravioli, crispy octopus, fingerling potatoes, the cavatelli and the grilled pork ribs. Their is, of course, a great wine list and other delicious drinks. What a fabulous selection and fresh ingredients which bring together new flavors in their food. We really enjoyed sharing all the dishes and having so much variety in our meal. I will return when I am in San Francisco.

Truly excellent

1760 was recommended by friends who live in SF and we felt very fortunate to have experienced this gem. We loved the concept of sharing plates and only wish that we could have sampled everything on the menu! Excellent service, a lively buzz and superb food. 10/10

Our concierge (Hotel Diva) recommended it and we are very thankful he did.Let's say just one thing: The fried duck sandwich?!?!? OMG! Who came up with that?!?Even that simple cantaloup-lime-honey amuse-bouches thingy was delicious.The service and the sommelier were awesome.

This was my fourth meal at 1760 and each time is better than the last. I particularly enjoy sitting at the communal table as you are closer to the activity on Polk st.. The food and alcohol is delicious. We always get the macaroni, the peppers, and then an assortment of other great dishes

good for happy hour

The service and food were excellent and presentation of dishes was unique. I just wish they would bring all the dish at once instead of one dish at a time made it for a long dinner. They do have some happy hour specials I would go back for

very tasty food and beautiful too

A good seat at the communal table afforded a view out the window at the late-day Bay-to-Breakers crowd going by. The flavors of the food were amazing and visually so appealing too. I'd go back for special occasions.

Trendy and good

Trendy restaurant with a hipster vibe. Service was nice and food was good. Although I would not go back there again, I would recommend it to others. Fun to try something new and in with decent food.

Not a single misstep.

I went with one friend. We were able to get there during &quot;The Stirring Hour&quot; and got incredible prices on some small plates and specialty cocktails. By the end of the meal we each had our cocktail and two glasses of wine. We also ordered a total of six different plates from the menu. There wasn't a single dish that wasn't amazing. The crispy octopus and potato dish was about the best I've ever had. The cavatelli pasta with Sonoma lamb was out of this world. We also had the lobster ceviche and the monkfish mousse. I can't wait to go back and try more dishes from the menu. And it's seasonal so I look forward to seeing how the menu changes later in the spring and summer.

Great Find

Amazing food, but not for everyone. Definitely an acquired taste. Small portions with very complex flavors that work well together. A great find.

Average at best, and in no way like Acquerello

In my opinion, Acquerello has been the best restaurant in San Francisco for 2 decades now, and when we heard that a sibling named 1760 was opening around the corner on Polk, we were excited to try it. The bottom line is that 1760 bears no resemblance to Acquerello, and you would never guess that they were related.The room is sleek, modern, non-descript, and a bit noisy on a Friday night. Service is casual but knowledgeable. The wine list is strong on Italian selections but a bit weak on Californians. The sommelier was very useful and lead us to an obscure Italian red that we never would have selected ourselves. It was delicious. Lots of specialty cocktails that we didn't try.The menu consists of 16 small and medium-sized plates that are meant to be shared. Shishito peppers were buried in grated hazelnuts, which really added nothing. The brussel sprouts with onions were nice, but not outstanding. The beef tartare was again flavored with nuts, and had a Thai vinaigrette. The cavatelli contained braised pork cheeks and had a flavorful tomato sauce. In summary, although the food was super trendy, the ingredients did not harmonize particularly well, and nothing rose to the level of excellent.To conclude, 1760 is just OK on its own. As a relation to Acquerello, it disappoints.

Welcome to the new chic restaurant where the cocktails reign supreme and match the sophisticated but very comfortable room. Spacious windows and high ceilings offer neighborhood views, and the bar is at one side of the room but separated from dining--although food is served at the bar. The menu features small plates (groan!) ranging from light entrees down to heavier ones. But you know the drill. Lots of orders add up. Some dishes were memorable, as were the cocktails. And finally a room that is lively but quiet enough to actually carry on a conversation in a cozy booth or at a table.

Delectable food and drink scene

This sibling to Acquerello is a great addition to Polk Street. The menu is short with an emphasis on specialty cocktails and wines by the glass and the crowd there the night we dined skewed younger. It is a lively scene and the food was excellent. We loved the blistered shisito peppers, enjoyed their version of hamachi and sampled the fried duck sandwich (a larger dish with some tasty cole slaw). A place to re-visit!

Trendy new sister of Acquerello.
