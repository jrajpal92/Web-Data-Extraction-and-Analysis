Being from Sydney and Wellington before that, finding great espresso can be tricky when visiting the US. Here's the spot, an oasis in a cool part of SFO. Highly recommended...

The two times we visited this cafe it was packed. The coffee is well made and the food was presented and tasted fantastic. tucked away from central San Francisco but well worth the journey

Such a great breakfast. It was so hard to decide what to get, so we ordered multiple things. Loved the gluten free toast and yogurt with granola/fruit. Wish we had gone back more than once.

I have been looking for a good coffee since arriving from Sydney on July 31. My son took me here and it was the best coffee so far comparable to any from Surry Hills in Sydney.

We spent a few days in San Francisco and Jane became our default breakfast spot. Great coffee, good baked eggs, the ricotta toast is a meal and a half. Service was not super quick, but quick enough and very friendly.

We were here for breakfast about five times. The food was always very good and healthy. They serve a lot of organic food, coffee and cookies. The prices are relatively high. A cool place to have breakfast!

Worth the long line on Saturday morning!

Jane is the perfect friendly neighborhood breakfast/lunch spot. Located on Fillmore, it is situated where lots of fun shopping await you, as well as being in one of the nicest neighborhoods in the City. My daughter lives on Fillmore, so Jane is her &quot;go-to&quot; coffee and breakfast treat stop. Jane does all things right-their french toasts (homemade breads), cinnamon rolls, egg dishes, everything! And their coffee is among the best I've ever had. You order at the counter, then you TRY to find a table or a few seats at the bar to await your meal. You can certainly order to go and find a sunny bench somewhere. I would imagine on weekdays you can take your laptop and sit at a table and work, but on weekends you may have people hovering near your table to snatch it once you're done eating. The food is great, service exceptional, atmosphere fun and trendy. Lots of locals intermixed with the occasional tourist that found themselves walking down Fillmore in search of a good cup of coffee. My only complaint was how long our food took, but I'm sure it was due to the long lines and perhaps not enough help.

We've been living in the city for a month and have sampled dozens of restaurants. Jane's was highly recommended, but wasn't quite as outstanding as suggested. The food was good, not as exceptional as some other places in the area. The staff was not particularly helpful. And the menu was surprisingly limited. We had a very good panini and a good salad, but would've liked more choices and a friendlier attitude.

At 7 in the morning, there are not too many places in Pacific Heights that are open and which serve breakfast foods. Having read about the amazing food at Jane's I was eager to try it, especially the highly-praised egg white sandwich and cookies. I got the egg white sandwich which was just okay in taste; size of the sandwich was large. On another occasion I tried the double oreo cookie and was underwhelmed again by the taste. My companion got the granola which was fine for granola. The coffee was excellent. To Jane's credit, it offers healthy options many of which I did not try such as avocado toast with poached egg on top and breakfast salads.

Coming from Wellington, NZ, I'm accustomed to great, strong coffee. We stumbled across this place after a 12 hour flight, and was pleasantly surprised by the high standard of coffee, and that they served flat whites with a standard double shot. The breakfast food is excellent, I have become addicted to the granola. It was nice to find a great cafe that reminded me of home. Great work team!

Visited on a busy Sunday morning. Good selection of sandwiches and salads. I had Avocado Mash which was OK and Egg White Sandwich which was very good. My friend has Rainbow Salad and it looked excellent. Everything tasted fresh. It's quite busy on Sundays, so I didn't like the crowded environment too much but it's probably good on a weekday.

Jane is a total good find. I think the atmosphere is hip and happening and the food is beautifully prepared and quite delicious. Coffee beans are from Portland's famous Stumptown and could be a bit more professionally prepared but it was good, not exceptional.GREAT healthy menu of breakkie and lunch options. My egg whites w/ spinach and avo on fresh sourdough was superb, w/ a little heat from sriracha...everything else coming out of the kitchen looked equally good. Most meals under $10 or low double digits.

First time in this place and it's very busy and popular. Good and fast service. My husband had spinach, tomato and soft boiled egg with kale and a spinach smoothie to go along with it. I had scrambled egg and cheddar cheese with tomato sauce sandwich and match ice tea. Both very delicious!

I absolutely love the atmosphere in this cafe, and I liked the music. They had a small, but good tea selection. I would say that $3 for a cup of tea is a lot, even in San Francisco. But otherwise this place was very nice.

This place was a great addition to Fillmore street. I really enjoyed the atmosphere and food but unfortunately the cleanliness of the place has gone downhill. It is not appetizing when you look around and it is not kept up. It is fabulous the place is busy - but it is disappointing it doesn't appear they have the staff or the focus on keeping it clean.

Coming from Australia, we have very high standards for coffee, and it has been hard to find a good coffee anywhere in San Francisco. Thank goodness we stumbled upon Jane - they serve a terrific latte (even by Aussie standards) - and the salads are pretty amazing, too!

Great service and delicious food! My only complaint is levied at my wife who thought it would do us good to walk 2.5 miles to get there...It was however (almost) worth the blisters!We had smoked salmon which was delicious and the service was top notch.Recommended.

We came here on a whim for breakfast before heading to Presidio Park for the day. My husband tried their quiche of the day which had ham and sausage. He loved it. I ordered the smoked salmon platter with capers, red onions, cream cheese, and a side salad. The salmon was perfect and I was very satisfied. The service is okay, not very friendly but they were quick. The food will have us coming back, for sure!

Well crafted delicious coffees but a little disappointed with the exceptionally slow Saturday morning start. 30 min wait for a coffee seems a little excessive. The good part was that the barista was apologetic though &amp; the coffees were perfect in every way.

I recently visited this restaurant while on vacation in San Francisco (I visited the Larkin location). Jane is a great little gem in a sea of craziness. Hungry for breakfast, my friends suggested we grab a quick bite at Jane. I assumed we were headed to some sort of greasy spoon diner but I was completely wrong. The decor reminded of something you'd find in my hometown of Portland, Oregon... clean, modern, retro and serving Stumptown Coffees. The fresh baked goods looked super delicious (even offering some gluten free options), but I chose to go with the full breakfast, their Autumn Scramble with fresh fruit and quinoa bread toast. It was so good. It was so good that I went back the next day for the same breakfast. Prices are a little steep but you're not getting greasy spoon fare, here. I'm talking well prepared and lots of thought go into every plate. My two friends got the French Toast which I'll admit I was pretty jealous of... it looked amazing and they both agreed it was some of the best they have had. Amazingly, this well prepared, well thought-out food came to our table quickly... quicker than I expected. Highly recommended.

Best Coffee in San Francisco (Stumptown Coffee)
Rating: 5

The first thing I noticed when I first came here was the Stumptown coffee. The only other places I have been able to get this coffee is Seattle, Portland and NYC. I have been craving this coffee for sometime so when I heard this place serves the coffee here, I knew I had to pay a visit.The layout of this cafe is pretty versatile; you have tables out front, stools at the bar, individual stools/tables on the side and seating upstairs. It's a pretty vibrant place unlike other coffee shops where patrons look like zombies and the ambiance is a bit depressing.The popularity of this place is evident in the rating on Yelp and also the difficulty in finding a seat here. It's a great place to grab lunch, meet a friend over coffee or get some work done (free wi-fi). Don't get caught up on other reviews/reviewers that state Philz, Four Barrel or Blue Bottle is the best coffee in town - they are delusional.

Lunch at Jane was very enjoyable. The roasted diestel turkey and provolone with home made cranberry relish and arugula sandwich was very tasty and a reasonable price at $8.50. If I find myself nearby at lunch time I would not hesitate to eat here again, but in a city with as many outstanding options as San Francisco I'm not sure I would go out of my way to eat here. In many cities I visit this would be a must stop location.

We were staying close by on our recent trip to San Francisco and Jane had been recommended to us as we love our coffee. we were not let down.This place is funky chic and quite small inside, which can mean it gets a bit squishy during busy periods. They serve Stumptown coffee (which we love) and great food.We had breakfast there one morning, if you're expecting a full cooked breakfast you'll be disappointed, but for a typical weekday breakfast the options of granola, egg sandwiches, fresh fruit, salmon platters, smoothies and toast are all there.I went for the egg white sandwich with spinach, avocado, provolone and a dash of sriracha which was piping hot and absolutely delicious.The following morning we went for coffee and cake to go. I had the banana bread, very tasty and very filling. My partner had the berry scone, after a small taste, I did have to admit to a small case of food envy.The coffee was what you would expect from a Stumptown provider, our only gripe was the speed of service. It was fine for us as we were on holiday, had we been heading to work we'd have found it all just a bit too slow...perhaps they like everyone to feel like they're on holiday?! As there is such limited space to queue and wait for your order, speeding up the coffee service may help the cramped waiting conditions.Overall, if you're on Fillmore, love good coffee and have a little time to spare, get yourself into Jane on Fillmore.

Great little coffee shop on Fillmore. Went every morning when I was out there last month. They use Stumptown coffee which is one of my favorites. Fabulous lattes. The best part, besides the great little bar to sit at, is the egg white sandwich. Delicious! Never tried their morning cookie and now wishing I did. :(

We tried Jane on a Saturday morning hoping for breakfast with very few options beyond the baked goods. I settled in the egg white sandwhich - egg whites, spinach and avocado with provolone and a dash of sriracha sauce - kind of different but actually tasty. The others had a mix of soup a Tomato curry, and salads. The menu is fairly limited and not terribly inventive but fresh and clearly healthy. Service is order at the bar which was mayhem on a Saturday late morning, as the line allowed for only a crack between diners and the counter to be shared with wait staff. Very popular, but I prefer the other options on Fillmore.
