Thank you everyone at Acquolina for a great meal. We felt welcome and satisfied as we left from our first visit with you. From the meatballs appetizer to espresso, we were very pleased with the cuisine, the service, the atmosphere, and the vibe.Our favorite dishes on this visit were the Meatballs Appetizer and the Fiocchi Pere, I recommend both to newcomers (like us).The meatballs had a superb flavor and went very well with the chianti. The Fiocchi Pere had a pear in every bite, along with the flavor of gorgonzola and walnuts. In addition, we enjoyed the gnocchi with pesto. It was so good that we ordered some &#34;to-go&#34; for later. The pizza was Diavola, which was enjoyed for its crust and well-blended flavor. It didn&#39;t last long, once it was placed upon our table.I highly recommend Acquolina. May your experience be as good as ours!

The red sauce has absolutely no flavor. When asked if we liked the pizza and we said no, he stated that maybe the next one would be better. It wasn&#39;t. The pizza crust was very bland as well. The service was good but that&#39;s really the only positive. I wouldn&#39;t recommend it

We had the spinach salad (phenomenal), caprese salad (delicious), the ravioli (unbelievably amazing), and the giorno &amp; sera pizza (crazy good). Practically all of the staff were Italian which really added to the charm of the restaurant. We were blown away by the food, and found the staff super nice and friendly. We highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking to have a relaxing time over a delectable meal.

Pizza here might be of the best texture anywhere on Earth. And it tastes fantastic too. I ordered the margarita pizza with black olives. The pizza was cooked to perfection. Crispy all the way through. A nice layer of tomato sauce with just the right amount of cheese.Only complaint, the olives definitely tasted like sliced canned olives.Service was fast and friendly.

Acquolina&#39;s menu doesn&#39;t really have anything that I haven&#39;t seen before at an Italian restaurant. Since nothing really popped out at my friends and I, we ordered a couple of classics: Bruschetta, a Pizza Diavola and the Pizza Giorno e Sera. Despite the seemingly simple choices, all of the food was fresh and packed with flavour. It&#39;s not the cheapest pizza joint that I&#39;ve been to, but you could certainly taste where your money was going in the quality of the ingredients.

A fairly new restaurant in an amazing area with a myriad of choices. The interior deco was appealing and it seemed super bright so I decided to check it out. Plus the wait at Tony&#39;s, Mama&#39;s was over 45 minutes and Park Tavern now had a 7 item lunch menu or something.The food was decently priced considering the area and it tasted the same. Nothing great. Had a tasty appetizer bruschetta that seemed doused in garlic and olive oil, but somehow the bread was toasted well so it worked.Then the pizza giorno. It was a bit messy and almost over baked, but it was a good, traditional Italian pizza with a lot of cheese and arugula.Overall, there were a couple of flies near my seated area that annoyed me all brunch and made me wonder if there was something going on, but overall a decent restaurant in a great location.

Came here for a glass of wine in the afternoon on a Saturday - not too busy, I was able to get a table outside. It&#39;s a great place to sit and people watch. Cheapest Rose is $9, $10 for bubbly.There&#39;s a happy hour from 3:30-6:30 where house wine is $6 and beer is $3. Although I didn&#39;t eat, the food I saw them bring out looked great.Ambience is casual, and it&#39;s clean and classy inside. I&#39;d eaten already otherwise I would&#39;ve loved to try the thin and crispy pizza they brought out to another table. Will return to try the food and update the review then.

Acquolina is one of the places where you can experience not just Italian food but also an important part of the Southern European lifestyle around the table - friendship and food for the best times. The staff is very friendly - Dario, Dario and Marco are great people and they make sure you feel yourself welcomed and as a guest to their place in the restaurant&#39;s casual setting.At the southeast corner of Washington Square, the outdoor sitting is perfect on the sunny days, where along with great company and great wine one can enjoy the &#34;dolce fare niente&#34; and catch up with your friendships without feeling the rush to go somewhere else.To top it off, an espresso like I have never had before in the city, a deliciously creamy thick espresso.

I wanted to go to North Beach for my birthday dinner and had planned on going back to Tony&#39;s which I have been to a few other times and loved the food there. I never tried their signature margarita pizza and had my heart set on that and also the meatballs other yelpers rave about. We did show up kind of late; 6:45 - 7PM on a wednesday night, but when I asked for a table for five, I was told in a very matter of fact way - 2 to 2 1/2 hours! .. What? you expect anybody to wait 2 1/2 hours to eat? are there actually tourists willing to wait that long? .. sorry honey! your pizza&#39;s good, it aint that good though! see ya wouldn&#39;t wanna be ya.Anyway, it was my birthday and we were all down there and ready to eat. I suppose it&#39;s our own fault for not considering that although it&#39;s excellent pizza and worth a wait, it&#39;s still a tourist trap and it was summer time. the last couple of times I had dined at Tony&#39;s, we waited fifteen minutes and a half an hour another time to be seated. that was more evening hours both times as I remember. So we had to pick another place to eat and fast. We walked right across the street to Acquolina and walked in and asked for a table for five and we were seated right away. The staff were friendly and attentive and our waitress checked in on us frequently.Three of us ordered the personal pizza&#39;s and my sister ordered the Tagliolini alla Bolognese. all four dishes were around the same price $17 -18. Me and my brother ordered the &#34;Pizza Deliziosa&#34; - mozzarella, ham and mushroom, and I don&#39;t remember which one my mother had. I liked the flavor of my pizza. the problem I had with it was that it was soaking wet in the middle and had to be eaten with a fork and knife. I mean the whole center, half the diameter of the pizza was wet on the bottom. I am not a fan of that or pizza that you need utensils to eat with. so it kind of ruined the whole experience for me. I did not notice or ask if my brother and mom&#39;s pizzas were the same but I did notice that they were also eating their pizzas with utensils and we never do that unless it&#39;s necessary. We did not order appetizers except for basic bread which was sliced focaccia for $2. Me and my brother each had a Peroni and I think my sister had some kind of cocktail. We also asked if they had apple juice or orange juice or something for my niece and they didn&#39;t have anything like that but brought something out for her that looked like a Pina Colada or some other tropical drink, non alcoholic of course, but it looked awesome though.My sister ordered a tiramisu and my mom had a cappuccino. My other complaint is that it seemed rather pricy for what it was. we each had an entree and I had a beer, my brother had a beer and I&#39;m pretty sure he did not have a second one but I could be wrong about that though. I&#39;m fairly sure that we did not order a dinner plate or kids meal for my niece as I remember my sister sharing her pasta and my brother sharing his pizza with her. so it seemed like a pretty small dinner and I looked over at the bill and it was $137 with gratuity included. I&#39;m just not sure how it came out to $137 based on our meal when each main entree was around $17 and we didn&#39;t order much of anything else. Considering it was mainly pizza and just good pizza, not great pizza and mine was all soggy, it seemed like it should have been much less than that.I did like the place, the friendly service and my pizza tasted pretty good but it came out more expensive than any time we even ate at Tony&#39;s across the street.

New spot in a great area, and with a ton of potential. Risky business opening up another Italian spot in the Italian capital of SF. We came in on a Friday night and were seated promptly. The place had a great vibe. There were a few open tables but mostly occupied.Loved our waitress and the great service throughout the meal. The food, about average. Started with the burrata app which was disappointing. It didn&#39;t taste entirely fresh or boast it&#39;s usual creaminess that makes the stuff so divine.We also tried the chicken porcini dish which was so overly sauced. I have to admit, it wasn&#39;t pretty to look at either. I did enjoy my tortellini stuffed with pears and gorgonzola, great flavors! My biggest complaint about all the dishes was that they came out luke warm, and after a few minutes, were cold. I mentioned it to the waitress but wasn&#39;t looking for a replacement. She did try to make it right, and ended up bringing our group a comped dessert. My dining companions also tried the margherita pizza which they seemed to enjoy.All in all, a good spot with plenty of room to grow.

Should get 6 stars but there isn&#39;t an option to do that!I came here on a whim last Sunday with some friends and I have to say I was blown away by the service. I have only come across service this good in extremely high end establishments, they poured extra large glasses of wine, gave us scores of sampler dishes (gratis!) and always knew when to pop in to see if we needed anything.The drinks (especially the acquolina) were fresh and fantastic, the food brought me right back to my time in Italy, and the service well that was world class.If you&#39;re going to North Beach or really in the mood for great food, drink, and atmosphere you really shouldn&#39;t skip over this place, it&#39;s the new gem of the city!

Short story: MEH.Food: was ok, fresh-ish, but not very flavorfulService: terrible is a good word. Food took about an hour to come outAmbience: the best part about this, as its overlooking the parkOverall: wouldn&#39;t come backLong story:So I came here with a gal pal at lunch time on a Thursday. They weren&#39;t too busy, but it was the lunch rush, so be mindful of that when reading the review.This place just replaced cafe divine, which used to be a north beach gem. Nonetheless, I was excited to give this place a try.We were seated promptly, and our waiter, who was straight outta Italy brought us some bread and took our orders.We were in a hurry to go, so we decided to order things we THOUGHT wouldn&#39;t take to much time to bring out (this being our vital mistake, of course)I ordered the insalata aquolino (chicken salad with avocado and mozzarella) and my girl ordered the crespelle alla fiorentina (French crepes with ricotta cheese and spinach, baked in marinara and besciamel sauce). And we were STOKED. Because crepes, obvi.Sooooo we sat outside because it was a glorious day in the city and the breeze was beautiful. The restaurant is on the corner of Washington square park, so we had a good view as well. We were eating our delicious homemade Italian bread and chatting. We were having so much fun, we didn&#39;t even realize 25 minutes has gone by and we hadn&#39;t gotten our food yet. The only reason we noticed was because we downed the bread like the hungry hippos we are.So we call over the waiter, because we were in a hurry, and he tells us he will go and check on the food. Another 10 minutes goes by and he comes back and says 5 more minutes. Then another 15 minutes goes by and still nothing. At this point I&#39;m getting annoyed. I don&#39;t think it should take 55 minutes for a salad and some baked crepes to come out.We finally get the food after waiting for an hour, and we literally have to eat like starving children. My salad was mediocre, and it&#39;s saving grace was the homemade Italian dressing, which complimented the avocado and mozzarella very nicely. The crepes were mediocre and to me, flavorless. The sauce didn&#39;t add as much flavor as I hope, and I was kind of disappointed, cause to me, you can&#39;t screw up a crepe.The waiter seems indifferent, and though somewhat attentive, was kind of a sassy pants. But secretly I loved his Italian face.So that&#39;s why they lost two stars. ONE HOUR WAIT for food that should have gone faster, and then the food was just mediocre.If you&#39;re in north beach and want fast, delicious Italian food, there are like 186 other places you can go. I would say choose your battles, you beautiful people.

I came here last night because we could not get into Tony&#39;s Pizza across the street, they had a 1 hr wait over there. We ordered the Pizza Deliziosa for $19 and the ravioli for $20. Their pizza was short on flavor, very boring and definitely not worth the $19. I had much better pizza at Pizza My Heart for much less money. Dominos pizza is better tasting then the pizza we had. Their ravioli was wonderful, lots of flavor, however the portion was small.While waiting to use their restroom, you get to see what&#39;s going on behind their counter. I noticed their employee (the gentleman) did NOT use rubber gloves when cutting their cold cuts/meats. I find it disgusting that his hands where touching the food/meat. I would not have wanted to eat that after seeing his hands were on the food.

Opening week so hard to judge but I wasn&#39;t terribly impressed. It was fine but unmemorable. The place itself is a nice upscale Italian cafe design and feels very spacious.The food was okay -- nothing bad but nothing great. The duck pasta was a good size portion and well presented; however, the porcini mushrooms were overshadowed by the rest of the dish. In addition, the pasta didn&#39;t absorb most of the sauce. The pizza primavera was missing the peppers listed when they came out -- they apologized but no one caught it until I already started eating and I wasn&#39;t going to wait another 30 minutes for a new pizza or less time for a overcooked same pizza with the peppers.The servers definitely were attentive and happy to be helpful though still learning the ropes on the menu. The owner (I think) greeted me but didn&#39;t really seem to want to hear (or couldn&#39;t understand?) feedback other than to hear it was good.

Acquolina! This was such a great experience and I will definitely return here in the future. Acquolina is as close as you can get to an authentic Italian experience, without being in Italy. From the food, to the staff, to the atmosphere, this restaurant really goes above and beyond.The waiters are extremely nice and know what they are doing. The menu is all typical Italian dishes. I had the Seafood Pasta, which I would highly recommend. Acquolina is not a big place, so you may have to wait a bit before you get a table.If you are going to North Beach or really in the mood for great food, drink, and atmosphere you really should not skip over this place, it is the new gem of the city!

I can die happy now that I&#39;ve found this place!I&#39;ve been hunting down the taste of Italy for months now, and Acqoulina = perfection. I would shave off my own eyebrows just for the food, no joke.The service at this place continue to blow me away. There is not enough kind words I can use to describe how awesome Dario and the rest of the Acquolina family are. They invite you in with open arms, and make you want to stay forever (if I could, I would).Acquolina deserves so much more than 5 stars. I feel no shame while I&#39;m laying on the couch in a food coma, only happiness knowing I live within a walking distance from this amazing restaurant.Lots of love from me!

So here is my update after reading the restaurant&#39;s response:&#34;$92 for four people...&#34; The food was enough for three adults, not four. One dish was shared by two people (our kids). The only thing we had that reflected four people was that we ordered drinks for four with the third and fourth being orange juice. With regard to the price, we did not have &#34;food, beers and cocktails&#34; but food, A beer and A cocktail (and the aforementioned orange juices).The restaurant&#39;s response did not address:The under-cooked Tortellini;The so-called &#34;ingredient&#34; of basil on the pizza which turned out to be just one single leaf;The sweet pizza sauce;The plastic pizza cheese;The missing beer.Make of this what you will.P.S. I lived and worked in Italy for a while and this place ain&#39;t authentic (but neither is most of North Beach but most of it does not claim to be so).

PROS- The environment is great. Definitely, welcoming and a strong feel for Italy. Our server was attentive and friendly. Loved that the staff spoke Italian.The panne cotta was delicious, probably the best thing that we ordered.Cons-Entrees took a bit long to get to us. I ordered the Chicken Breast in a Mushroom sauce. First off, it was more of a Filet then a breast. The sauce had decent flavor but it was not thick enough to be called a sauce. It was more of a liquid. The vegetables were over cooked, too soggy. The presentation of the dish needs some work. Overall, not worth them price.I would probably stick to a pizza if I ever go back.

As Italian I can definitely say this place is one of the best places to go for the Italian food in San Francisco.What is most surprising is that these guys (from Tuscany) opened only 2 months ago, and both service and food already achieved the excellence.I got a Pizza di Sera, with prosciutto di Parma, mozzarella and arugula. It was a hard choice for a Parmesan customer (lol), but that surprised me as well. In fact, it is not the fake oily Italian pizza I found in a lot of places in this city, but a thin, light and simply delicious pizza.One of mine had the lamb in a pistachio crust topped with balsamic. Since he spent all the time praising that dish, I decided to come back to try other dishes.The second time, I started with the baby octopus in marinara sauce (Moscardini alla livornese), and I swear I never tried something so unique in Italy. The tenderness and delicateness of this mollusc was emphasized by the medium spiced sauce.After that, I got the Fiocchi di Pere, an indescribable tasteful contrast between the sweetness of pears and the gently salted pesto sauce. A true senses experience for my palate.On the top of it, my dinner was accompanied by a Morellino di Scansano, characterized by a wonderful freshness and a fruity roundness.Finally, even if the restaurant was busy, our server cared a lot about our dinner and provided us with a lot of laughs too - that is soooo Italian :-)Whenever I will miss my country, I will have a meal in this place that is so familiar to me.

Food was pretty good, but the service left a lot to be desired. Took probably 35 minutes to get my beer, but when we asked for the check it was there in less than a minute. The caprese was fresh and the pizza was pretty tasty, but the slow service and the unpolished decor left a bit to be desired (the TV and projector that were playing Italian movies showed a computer desktop for minutes at a time).Also, one bathroom, so there was a line the entire time we were there.

This place is awful! Too busy trying to close up and have a large Italian dinner for the employees to eat set up in the middle of the restaurant to worry about serving any patrons. Pizza was thin no taste crust. We ordered the salami pizza. No flavor at all and for 8 small slices you got maybe 6 pieces of salami. We asked for extra and they charged us $3.00 more. Oh, hell, no.

What a cutesy little place!Came here yesterday for some wine and din with the gals and it was a very pleasant experience.I have to give the service 5 stars- our waiter was awesome, literally explained the entire menu to me and I didn&#39;t even have to ask. It was very helpful since I just had no idea what I wanted. He always asked how we were doing and kept on pouring us our Pinot Grigio (which by the way was divine).Love the location and love that they have outdoor seating for a nice day.To start, we ordered the burrata that came with prosciutto and arugula. I think the burrata was over chilled? It didn&#39;t seep out all cheesy like, which was a little disappointing. I like to soak my bread in the creamy cheese and couldn&#39;t do it with that. So perhaps it was more of a mozzarella instead. It was still good- but not true burrata unfortunately. Besides that, the prosciutto and arugula were great.For my entree I ordered (or let&#39;s say the waiter ordered) the pasta with shrimp and asparagus. They make their own pasta here and it was a tasty dish with lots of flavors. My friends ordered pizza. Next time I come, I would probably order the smoked salmon pizza (had a slice and it was bomb).**Now let&#39;s quickly talk about the snobby pretentious girls at the table next to us (because if you&#39;re reading this review you need to get your restaurant manners in check). These girls were so rude to the restaurant staff it was actually hard not to say anything to them, I felt really bad for their waiter. Yes- I am talking to you who scolded the waiter for petting your dog.

We went here last night because we couldn&#39;t get into any other place. By the looks of it, it is a cute Italian restaurant with a peppy high energy vibe. Food, however, was below average. The pizzas were bland, low on sauce and flavor. The ravioli was nice but portions were small. Our sever was friendly though, so was the host. We also got the bruschetta - which I would say was average.

Acquolina is great Italian food prepared by Italians! My wife and I love to chat with the staff (and owner) and really like the food. The view of Washington Square is an extra benefit making a great ambiance.

Seriously the best food I had while visiting San Francisco! I recommend the ravioli with truffle cream sauce and the pear/gorgonzola tortellini. I wish they delivered all the way to Kentucky because these were the best dishes I had in San Fran and maybe in my life.

North Beach can be overwhelming with the amount of Italian restaurants in the area, and you&#39;re always afraid to make a bad choice. Luckily, we ended up with a solid choice in Acquolina. A group of six of us had dinner there on a Saturday night, and everybody was pleased with their dishes. I had a Lasagna with salmon, which ended up tasting a lot better than it sounded. There a balanced menu between apps, pasta dishes, stand-alone entrees, and pizzas, providing options for everyone without being overwhelming. Our table ordered a mixture of pasta dishes and pizza, and everyone had positive things to say. The pricing is pretty much on par with everything else you&#39;re going to find in this part of the city.

We came here because the wait for Tony&#39;s was ridiculous. I wasn&#39;t expecting much, to be honest, but their pizza definitely exceeded expectations. We ordered bread and the pizza with speck and marscapone. The bread was underwhelming, but the pizza was amazing. Whoever decided to put marscapone on pizza is a genius. It&#39;s not something that blows you away immediately, but I haven&#39;t been able to stop thinking about the taste of that pizza. (Try it with their chili oil -- also delicious!)

No good. It took 25 minutes to get our drinks, and the restaurant was not even half full. Appetizer came before the drinks, without plates, or silverware, etc. We&#39;re talking beer and wine here.Don&#39;t waste your time here. Yes, the owner or manager asked for feedback, and I gave it to him. Maybe they will have an epiphany but we won&#39;t be around to see it.

Disorganized, messy service, mediocre food.We were looking forward to Acquolina, and went this evening for an early dinner. We were not impressed. The food was mediocre, and not memorable. My girlfriend had the caprese salad and a margarita pizza. I had the Italian sausage and the osso bucco. The pizza was bland and uninspired. The osso bucco was solid but a tick too cold, with a completely unrelated random veggie garnish. Unfortunately the service seemed quite stretched, but for no apparent reason, the place was only half full. All dishes came to the wrong table (at least around us), and we were asked for dessert when we finished our starters. We had to ask for bread, and also the wine list. These are simple things to get right, and make guests comfortable and welcome, but it looks like this is not a priority.

This place... Lol. The staff is a mess, moved us to a different table after seating us, told us they didn&#39;t&#39; have rigatoni even though the person next to us was eating rigatoni, said they were out of lasagna even though lunch had just started, and then brought 2/3 of the people in my party the wrong dishes. It was all around just kind of a mess and the food wasn&#39;t very good (the ham was translucent and creepy looking) so it&#39;s not like they redeemed themselves with outstanding food. Meh, go somewhere else.

What a great meal. Baby octopus in a spicy red, pea and olive sauce. Perfect osso bucco - better than we can make at home. Incredibly soft gnocchi in an amazing duck sauce. The Delicious homemade chestnut pasta stuffed with burrata cheese. Super Tuscan wine by the glass.The lunch menu has the best chicken marsala I have ever eaten. Best by orders of magnitude. Had no idea that chicken marsala was supposed to taste like this.The pizza has a thin, cracker-like crust, with a thin layer of toppings. The effect is much lighter than pizza I usually eat. Your mileage may vary.Dessert&#39;s chocolate &#34;flan&#34;/caldo is a dense, warm chocolate cake.Gorgeous views of the park. Italian movie showing on the wall. Our own Foreign Cinema - but with even better food.

It was a Saturday night about 45 minutes before they closed, and they weren&#39;t busy at all. No one would acknowledge us, the waiters would walk by without making eye contact. When we were finally seated, we waited 15 minutes and again no one acknowledged us. We ended up leaving and got a table at another pizza place that was much better. We won&#39;t be back.

The weather had finally cooled enough for al fresco dining, so we headed out to Acquolina.We had waited several months to make this inaugural visit, hoping the kinks had been ironed-out. We waited a little too long to be seated, but the young man who seated us was charmingly Italian and very gracious, which saved the situation. The wait-staff is young, but very motivated to please. The food is very good. As someone mentioned in an earlier review, it would take fortitude to open another Italian restaurant in North Beach; the competition is considerable.I started with the caprese salad which was good, but not inspired. My partner had the salmon carpaccio and she raved about it. I followed my salad with the Pizza Giorno e Sera which was out-of-this world - truly great - and my partner had the Mezzi Rigatoni alla Norma pasta. She said the freshly made pasta was wonderful, but the lack of vegetables disappointed her. We accompanied our lunch with a well-priced and very good Barolo. The young man who was apparently the manager surprised us with a complementary desert - the housemade Panna Cotta, which was outstanding and an unexpected treat.This restaurant will become a great restaurant if it survives in this highly competitive environment. With restaurants like the North Beach just up the street, it will be a tough. However, the upbeat, charming staff will help keep the customers coming back while the kitchen matures. I will be coming back for dinner soon.

Best pizza I have had in years. The lasagna was to die for! Not to mention the staff was great and everyone talked with a true Italian accent. What other way would you want to be served in an Italian restaurant. They offer a great wine list and outside seating. If you&#39;re in North Beach, check out Acquolina. You&#39;ll be happy you did!

Before I get to the food and service, let just say what a location! Right on Washington Square Park and still in the charming neighborhood of North Beach, but with out the crazy hustle and bustle of Columbus. Eating outside on a warm summer was gorgeous - and how a nice Italian meal should be enjoyed!Food was great. Bruschetta was fresh and tasty and the pizza did not disappoint. We especially loved the ravioli which is handmade in the restaurant.Service was great too. Our waiter was attentive and maintained that Italian charm. He struggled a bit through his Italian to find some of the right English words - but I sort of loved that albeit we were at an Italian restaurant. Definitely would come back again and hopefully next time for brunch!

So very disappointed. I live in the neighborhood, and was excited to see a new restaurant open overlooking the park. On the positive side, it is a beautiful location - but, when I had brunch on Sunday I felt really let down. Firstly, this is a pretty expensive place - but, I do expect to get good service as well as decent food when paying $50 for two breakfasts.The eggs were undercooked, and the portions very small. I tried the poached egg on pita, with a side of salad, and my wife had the breakfast pizza. We only had coffee.... so $50 seems a little steep when you leave a place hungry. I may try this place one more time....but too many other choices in the area means I won&#39;t be rushing back.

The food here was beyond disappointing! I&#39;m from a big Italian family and grew up in NY, so I am always looking for authentic Italian food. We came in for Sunday lunch and had high hopes based on the story behind the restaurant (Italians from Tuscany, so it should be awesome, right?!). Our server was lovely and very friendly, but that&#39;s where it ended. We got the Vegetarian Bolognese Tagliolini and a Primavera pizza. The food took forever to come out considering we were the only ones here when we arrived. The bread in the bread basket was approaching stale, then the food arrived. The pizza crust was flavorless, so thin that the pizza crumbled when my BF picked it up, and it couldn&#39;t support the cheese and toppings. The vegetables were inedible ... way over the hill to the point of even smelling rotten. The Bolognese sauce was flavorful (not chunky like one would expect a Bolognese to be though), but the pasta was too thick and gummy. We barely finished half of our meals each because they were just awful. $35 bucks later, we&#39;re still looking for lunch ...

I&#39;m curious as how this restaurant acquired 4.5 stars. Bruschetta was more like micro chopped salsa on thin crostini, which at its sad state was actually then best part of the meal. I ordered the chestnut ravioli and my friends ordered the mushroom/duck pasta. I understand the idea of &#34;al dente&#34; but what we ate tasted merely of raw hard dough, cold and undercooked. Sauce didn&#39;t marinate or enhance the food either. We simply couldn&#39;t finish it (even though I tend to finish food I don&#39;t find satisfactory), upon collection of our half finished plates and not wanting to take it to go either, staff didn&#39;t bother to ask how we found the food. Avoid pls ...

Another tourist trap in North Beach. it seems that the local people, can&#39;t get closer to North beach without being treated as a cheap tourist that will tip little or nothing at the end of their meal. As a result of this, you get a bad service and an added gratuity in the bill plus a three suggested tips at the bottom so you may tip twice in case you didn&#39;t notice you were charged for this already (for a party of two). And the worst part is that all of these calculated tips came after the after tax total I hope the owner of this place reconsider these practices before receiving a visit from the IRS

We came in for an appetizer and a glass of wine, the service was meh at best we sat ourselves and after a while went to the bar to order food even though waiters do exist at this place. We ordered the bruschetta which took 20 mins but was amazing. Overall a great place for food and wine if you have the time to spare and aren&#39;t in a rush.

The antipasto and bruschetta were delicious, while the pizza we had ordered was a little bit of a letdown. It was a little to wet. The space could use a little help as well, felt a little cavernous and empty, although the restaurant was filled.

Tried to go for breakfast, but it was closed, with the breakfast hours torn off the top of the hours sign and breakfast menu removed. Peered through the windows and was disappointed to see one of those communal tables with barstools. We&#39;ve grown to expect this from American restauranteurs, but not European. We&#39;ll update after we have a meal here.Update: Our disappointment only increased after our first, and last, meal at Acquolina. We ordered a bottle of wine, 2 apps, and 2 entrees. Each was disappointing. We left half the bottle of wine behind. It was like 2-buck Chuck, but not priced accordingly. Both salads were soaked in vinegar, no oil, and boring. Both pastas were undercooked even by Italian standards and the sauces overcooked to the point of tasting burnt and the meat tough and dry. Other waiters seemed much more pleasant than ours, who never smiled or made eye contact and spoke tersely throughout. A group of 4 women who, like us, used to go to Cafe Divine regularly, got great, friendly service from another waiter, who flirted and fussed over them. They ordered 2 wines he recommended and I&#39;m sure would give a much better review than we. With an Italian radio station blasting Eurotrash disco and commercials, we didn&#39;t linger for dessert and asked for the check -- which took 25 minutes to arrive. There were guests at only half the tables and there were 5 waiters, so there was no reason for that -- and none given by our dismissive waiter. We won&#39;t be back. It&#39;s a shame. It&#39;s a beautiful space with a great view of Washington Square. But we&#39;ve eaten at too many &#34;menu turistica&#34; clip joints in Italy just like Acquolina and don&#39;t need to put up with it at home in SF. We went around the corner to the gelato shop and walked our cones around Washington square as the sun set, which very much rescued what would have been an unpleasant evening.

It was a gnocchi with squash and spinach...delicious!! The Panna cotta with plums for dessert was also incredible.

The view into Washington square park also really added to my enjoyment of the evening there, and a bottle of prosecco never hurt anyone either!

While the food was alright, the service at Acquolina was absolutely horrendous. The server lost track of what we had ordered. One of the entrees was completely wrong (he brought out tortellini when we had ordered gnochhi, and then told us that tortellini was gnocchi), and my entree order wasn&#39;t even given to the kitchen to make. Each of the entrees ended up coming out 20-30 minutes apart, so by the time I got my food, the rest of my party had finished eating. There were no apologies or acknowledgement that a mistake had been made from the staff. Will not be going back to Acquolina.

Just had a amazing dinner at Acquolina with friends. If you want authentic italian food here in San Francisco this restaurant is a good choice. The staff was attentive. THe chef came out to check on our table to see if we were satisfied with our food which we all thought was YUMMY. We ordered Baby Octopus w/green peas, the sauce was so good I wanted to lick the plate. Shared the house salad it was super fresh, the homemade chestnut pasta and rack of lamb were all amazing choices that our table shared.To top the evening off we learned that the owner Dario has brought his family and friends here from Italy to help open this new restaurant in NOrth Beach. They are the real deal if you want fresh home cooked authentic Italian food.These folks are new to the restaurant business so may be the reason for a few bad reviews on this site. Perhaps now they are getting their act together.

We had the antipasto toscana for openers (delish), and since we were out for pizza, ordered the Di Sera, &amp; Deliziosa, each just big enough to finish at the table and well worth the 12 block hike. Highly recommend.

Went there for dinner a couple of times and great service and great home made pasta. Wine is also really good.

A very enjoyable time yesterday afternoon at Acquolina for a late lunch with friends. We enjoyed the food, Bellini, coffee and especially the beautiful and friendly atmosphere. We sat inside by the window. Comfortable seating, great place for people watching, attentive and friendly wait staff but not overbearing. My only suggestion to them though is that they not clear the plates of the finished diners unless asked to do so if one of the party is still eating (that was me). Other than this I did not feel rushed even though people were waiting for a table. My pasta was good and homemade noodles but the sauce was a little bland (needed a good sprinkling of parmesan cheese which I had to ask for), the maille (pork stew) was delicious as was the very thin crust pizza, and the chocolate croissant we ordered with our coffee afterwards. Other dishes I saw other people eating looked fantastic. I want to go back and try more. We felt so welcome here, by the owner, Dario, and all the staff. That added so much to our experience. It was such a pleasant experience we will definitely return!
