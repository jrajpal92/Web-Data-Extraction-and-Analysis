For someone that lives in Dublin, Ireland, going somewhere to have an as close-to-as-it-gets Mexican meal this is the spot to go. Had a delicious fish taco with tons of spicy sauce and veggies. They were accommodating when I wanted to swop the rice to salad, which was a big plus. Sometimes I find it gets too heavy with all that rice AND bread.Had a couple of bottles with white sangria to go with it which meant that yes we were rolling out of the restaurant his Sunday afternoon. But it didn&#39;t really matter as I was going straight on a plane back to Dublin... I&#39;ll be back next I&#39;m in down. And oh, regarding prices very affordable. Only downside was they were out of avocado this day. I survived it. :)

I&#39;ve been here a few times and each time, I&#39;ve enjoyed my meal. First, let me say, I like the location. I&#39;m a sucker for a corner restaurant with huge windows so you can enjoy people watching. I mean, the theater of street life is free entertainment, right? (Ideal too if you&#39;re dining alone.) Anyway, I recently went in for lunch and ordered their grilled fish tacos. It was delicious and served in presumably a stone-ground blue corn tortilla. It was sturdy and held the nicely grilled tacos well. If I recall, the fish was cod. It was bright, fresh, and extra delicious with the accompanying salsa. The two tacos were served with rice and a wedge of lime. The rice though was a bit more al dente than I&#39;d like it to be. In other words, it needed an extra minute or two to get to the desired fluffiness. In past visits, I&#39;ve also had their green chile stew which is tasty and satisfying. They also have a pretty solid horchata, a perfect drink for warm autumn San Francisco days. (I&#39;ll never understand why our summers are chilly and why our autumns are hot. [Not. About. The. Heat.])The service is efficient and deserves high marks. You order on a menu at the register, they give you a number, and the food is brought out to your table. The food runners are friendly and attentive. For example, one of the runners not only brought our orders but automatically refilled our chips when we ran out from the chips+guacamole appetizer. And by the way, their tortilla chips are everything! I love thick tortilla chips. Thin chips are good too but I&#39;m partial to these thicker cuts *and* they don&#39;t under-salt like some places.Green Chile has been open for years and clearly they know how to keep their clientele.

Wasn&#39;t a huge fan. It&#39;s has such a cute theme and nice people but the food is mediocre therefore felt overpriced. I had the enchilada which was definitely not made to order and was dry. My guy had the burrito and that was better with a lot more flavor but still underwhelming.Good beer selection. Not sure I&#39;d go back.

The steak tacos were juicy and delicious. My friend ordered the burrito and had a big smile on her face when she was done eating. They have a summer menu with corn on the cob and the quinoa bowls look really good. I loved the housemade watermelon drink, it was fresh and summery.It has a pretty laid back but cool ambience. You can sit outside or at the window seats, good for people watching!

We&#39;re big fans of Green Chili Kitchen. The meals can range from light to hearty. They use wonderful ingredients and serve a creative mix of classics and creative takes on New Mexican cuisine.One little thing they do that kicks it up one small notch is that everything is served on Heath serving ware. It&#39;s a small but really well received touch.Lastly, this is a vegetarian diner&#39;s haven. It&#39;s got good stuff and multiple options.

This place is Mexican fusion restaurant - not really authentic Mexican food but super yammy and tasty. If you are in the Divisadero area, it&#39;s definitely worth a try.I had the dinner plate - chicken with mashed potatoes and salad and was definitely fulfilling. The ambiance is an open-space, a little hipster, and very clean. There are a lot of families that come to this restaurant. Everyone says that you should try the quinoa chicken salad.

The day after our holiday staff party, my company buys us breakfast. This year, on Friday, December 11th, we got delivery through Caviar. Our company placed it a day or so prior for a scheduled delivery at 10am. Unfortunately, 10am came and went and we still didn&#39;t have our food. Not sure who messed up, but Caviar comped half of our order. We didn&#39;t get breakfast until 11am and everyone was starving!Prices below are what Caviar charges. Looking online, their tacos are listed at $4 each and adding Guacamole is $0.75, so prices aren&#39;t that much more on Caviar.Breakfast soft or crispy taco: housemade corn tortilla with eggs, cheese, pico de gallo ($4.10 each)*Chorizo, crispy, add Jalapeno (+$0.80), Guacamole (+$0.80)*Steak, soft, add Jalapeno (+$0.80), Guacamole (+$0.80)I don&#39;t like beans or tortillas, so I decided tacos were the best thing to order. I adored the crunchy taco. The chorizo was spicy and flavorful. Sooo good! The steak taco was disappointing. The meat was mushy for steak and didn&#39;t have much flavor. I&#39;d definitely stay away from steak anything here if mine was any indication of what it tastes like.The crunchy taco was delish, but the steak fell flat. With each taco being almost $6, I expected a little more from the steak taco. I know prices are inflated by Caviar, but still, why was the steak so mushy? I kind of wish I had the chorizo taco last so I could have ended breakfast on a better note.

Green Chile Kitchen is around the corner from us and does &#34;New Mexican Cuisine&#34;. My roommate from New Mexico tells me it isn&#39;t authentic New Mexican food. But isn&#39;t authentic New Mexican food just inauthentic Mexican food? So what&#39;s inauthentic New Mexican food? Have I said anything offensive yet?Well authentic or not I&#39;m down: nice ambiance, no wait for dinner, they also do takeout (can order online through Yelp, for those of us who don&#39;t like talking to humans). Green chile stew, sopapillas (hadn&#39;t had those before, they&#39;re awesome) and wet burritos are all great - hearty portions. Their dessert/bakery place a few doors down - &#34;Green Chile Pies&#34; is also amazing - see my review over there to understand just how amazing.See ya there

Like everyone said, its pricey. 16$ for quinoa, roasted veggies, and pulled pork? Um okay... Anyways that what I ordered, and its good!! I liked it. A bit spicy so be warned! Only suggestion for this dish...would be to use less pulled pork (I know crazy right!?) and put in more roasted veggies (which then hopefully would bring down the price huh huh huh???) Yeah just a little heavy on the meat, would be nice to eat more veggies.cute SF restaurant! great outdoor seating, awesome location, great natural light. friendly staff, great beer selection.

I agree with my soul sista Kelly that it is a little pricey here. You just have to walk in remembering that this is more of a New-Mexican fusion-y sort of place and not your normal taqueria. Ya dig?? (Though, you do have to get up and grab your utensils, water, etc.) Also, service here is friendly.I&#39;m currently addicted to the stuffed quinoa poblano pepper. It is so delicious and tasty and comes with rice and beans (my fav). If you&#39;re vegan (I&#39;m not but sometimes I eat this way just because), this place is great because they have a handful of items on the menu that cater to this. I&#39;ve had the enchilada and the burrito maybe(?a while back?) here, which was okay, but now I just STICK TO DA POBLANO!! Or I&#39;d suggest sticking to the more NEW mexican-healthy-ish like the quinoa bowl things.

Great food - chicken is outrageously good. Nice relaxed atmosphere in a beautifully restored building.Outstanding service and family friendly too. My kids are already grown but when they were little I would scour the city looking for places like this. Big tables for kids to color while eating.I have no idea what New Mexico food (see other reviews) is supposed to taste like, so cannot comment on that. I also read the negative comments before I went and saw nothing that justified concerns.I will return to try other menu items but it will be hard to pass by the chicken. Huge portions by the way: the half chicken was more than this big guy could eat.

I love the atmosphere here, it has really high ceilings and big sliding windows and a mix of booths and tables and high tops and bar seating. There are some good vegan options, the tamales are great plus one of the specials seems to usually be vegan. The portions are pretty big. They have a few good beers plus the usual Pacifico etc. You order at the counter and then get a number for your table so there aren&#39;t a lot of wait staff running around.

Nope. Nope. Nope. Had dinner here this past week. We ordered a grilled chicken burrito, red chile chicken posole and homemade tamales. The food did not taste good or feel authentic and very overpriced.Grilled Chicken Burrito:I ordered it with guacamole inside (paid extra for that which is normal in any Mexican restaurant). What did I get? A burrito with no guac inside but instead a small little dot of guac sitting on top of it. I had to get back in line and order more guac on the side to eat with this burrito. The chicken had no flavor, there seemed to be white rice in there (different than the rice that came with the tamales), black beans and some pico de gallo salsa. I ordered it to have a small amount of rice and more black beans, I got the opposite. Either the one taking my order didn&#39;t make that note or the cook didn&#39;t follow it. Or maybe she didn&#39;t give a sh**. I don&#39;t know. Either way, this burrito was one of the worst I&#39;ve had in a really really long time. Dare I say, Chipotle can make a better burrito than this for a fraction of the price.Homemade tamales:Ordered the chicken and pork tamales with the green chile sauce. It was made with blue corn. First, there was barely any meat inside of the pork tamale. It was mostly blue corn and did not taste like anything at all. This thing lacked seasoning. The chicken tamale had more meat but still the issue remained that it did not taste like much. Typically there is more corn than meat but this place made it more drastic than that. I would have been okay with that if the blue corn tasted good, but it didn&#39;t. The rice that came with it was hard as a rock too. Horrible dish...Red Chile Chicken Posole:The only thing they got right in this place. Tasted really good actually. The blue corn tortilla it came with though, not good.Lesson learned, this place cannot compete with any hole-in-the-wall Mexican restaurant. Hell, Chipotle and Chevy&#39;s beats this place.

It&#39;s been a while since we ate here but the boyfriend and I split a grilled steak burrito. The restaurant itself is large and open which felt perfect for summer. We ordered, sat down, and received our food. The presentation of the food was underwhelming (large brown plate, burrito, chips) but the burrito was pretty tasty. I accidentally drizzled their red chile honey on the burrito (apparently it is used for dessert) but I gotta say, it was delicious! If they&#39;re not marketing this honey as their special burrito condiment they definitely should!

The New Mexican Smothered Burrito I had here was underwhelming. 14.00 for flavorless meat, +75 for pico +75 for a teaspoon of guacamole. Ay dios mio. You&#39;re kidding me right?The redemption was the red chile chicken posole had an excellent mix of hominy, cilantro &amp; onion. Despite the cup being an anemic portion for a six dollar price point, it was still pretty good.I&#39;d come back for the posole.

I think something&#39;s wrong with Yelp right now, because this is not a 3.5 star restaurant. Pozole: amazing. Green Chile stew: double amazing, and actually spicy for a change. Orchata: so good, not too sweet, which is usually the mistake people make. Plus a free refill! They also have a variety of salsas available, all of which were delicious. Tamales: respectable, fresh. Not too much meat, not too much corn.If you like Mexican, come here.

Another SF establishment that&#39;s all about the ambience and way too less about the overpriced food . I get the references to a monastery or some religious building ... that was cool. But that&#39;s pretty much where the cool ended . Dry sickly green tamales , under whelming chile relleno burritos and sangria that tasted like cheap wine and 7 up... Really ?! With all the Mexican options one has in the city this can easily be avoided and you&#39;ll thank your taste buds and your wallet

It&#39;s a rainy day, we&#39;re on our way home from the dog park and suddenly realize we&#39;re starving. My friend navigates us to Green Chile and we park, leave the dogs in the car (knowing they&#39;ll be everywhere they&#39;re not supposed to be) and walk to the restaurant. It&#39;s in between lunch and dinner so not very busy. It feels like a converted warehouse in there. Very tall ceilings, huge windows, chunky and industrial decor. There&#39;s a heavy Mexican theme which reminds me of living in Seattle in the 1990s when we decorated with a lot of wrought iron and Catholic iconography. I love it.The menu is great -- lots of tamales and sopas and combinations -- prices are reasonable and there&#39;s a lot to choose from. Inexplicably, I order a burrito. It was good but is not the best example of what this place is capable of. I had a bite of my friend&#39;s food and it was much better. My advice, skip the burrito, get out of your comfort zone and try something new. Ingredients are responsibly sourced, the presentation is fabulous and the dishes have a unique twist on them. I would definitely like to come back when I&#39;m feeling more adventurous.

I moved to San Francisco from central New Mexico, and over time I&#39;ve built up a serious craving for anything New Mexico. I was excited to try this place out with a few friends, two of whom were also New Mexico expatriates.The good was generally pretty okay. I know that doesn&#39;t sound super positive, and I kind of don&#39;t mean for it to. It was definitely authentic New Mexican, but it wasn&#39;t as good as any of my favorite New Mexico outfits, and I felt that it was a bit overpriced for what it was. The sopapillas were particularly disappointing, which was a big letdown since that&#39;s one of the things I was most looking forward to.That said, the restaurant is nicely decorated and generally well kept, although it was quite busy when I went on a Saturday afternoon.

I love the idea of bringing the unique twist on mexican food that you find in New Mexico, here to SF, but I still can&#39;t help but feel this is only the beta test version of a better New Mexican restaurant that is yet to come.Of course the food is a bit pricey, but it&#39;s generally solid and the atmosphere is nice.I think if you live or work in the neighborhood, you should probably just check the place out for yourself. I just can&#39;t say with any confidence that once you do, you&#39;ll want to keep coming back.The burritos are solid but not great and are probably not the best example of what&#39;s best about this place (or New Mexican food in general). If I go back, I&#39;ll stick to the stews and other items and adjust my review accordingly.

I spent a large part of my youth vacationing in the land of enchantment where a huge chunk of my extended family lives. The result of this being that I get the occasional craving for New Mexican style food smothered in green chile.I had no idea that such a place could be found in the heart of SF until we ended up trying Green Chile Kitchen. Finding this place brings me a lot of happiness because now I don&#39;t have to travel thousands of miles to get delicious stuffed sopaipillas.To top it off, when we reached down to grab the honey for our extra order of sopaipillas, we saw that they bring in red chile honey from Monroe&#39;s, one of our favorite New Mexico restaurants!Everything we ordered here was great. Super nachos with pork belly, green chile roasted pork burritos, enchiladas, stuffed chiles and most importantly, the carne adovada stuffed sopaipillas... it all hits the spot in just the right way.As an added bonus, if you take the receipt down the block to their partner store Green Chile Pies &amp; Ice cream, you get a discount on some very delicious dessert options.This place is a definite winner and I will without a doubt be returning here for more in the future.

Our company had them cater lunch to us and I thought their food was pretty good. It&#39;s considered New Mexican-style cuisine, so everything has a &#34;southwestern&#34; influence to it.I tried their steak burrito, their chicken tamale steak taco fillings, Spanish rice and their refried beans. The food was pretty good, but nothing blew me away. I was a little sad that the salsas weren&#39;t better labeled and therefore had to play guess and check to figure out which one was the mild one, but that&#39;s more our company&#39;s fault than Green Chile&#39;s.I thought the meat was flavorful but a bit dry, but that might&#39;ve been from transporting between the kitchen and our table. Otherwise, no huge complaints.

New Mexico native here, dad is a chef. Here&#39;s the deal.I join in heartfelt (though bittersweet) agreement with those who have commented on the lack of flavors in most of the dishes. While the ingredients are fresh and authentic, I have yet to eat a dish here that felt &#39;right&#39; as far as the spices, intricate flavorings, and &#39;oomph&#39; that true New Mexican food requires. There is, I regret, a richness that is missing. Call me crazy, or maybe I&#39;ve just had my family&#39;s cooking for 20 years too long, but they simply don&#39;t use the right combination of salt, fats and spices to make me swoon. The blandness of the food, however, is of minor concern compared to the unnaturally ostentatious air that the restaurant itself presents.According to their website, the food is &#34;inspired by Logan&#39;s many years spent in Santa Fe, New Mexico.&#34; First of all, spending many years (ahem, college) somewhere is not a qualification for understanding of an area&#39;s culture or cuisine. Good business idea, buddy, but I would leave it to the pros on this one, especially if they are an 82-y/o abuelita who could school yo ass in making tortillas. Second of all, Santa Fe is to Albuquerque as Marin is to the Mission. An hour apart but a world of difference. Obviously the food in the actual Santa Fe is just as good as the food in the actual Albuquerque, or Las Cruces, or Bernalillo, but it is also more flashy and more expensive, something that evidently also inspired the owners&#39; restaurant design. At least in Santa Fe, if you splurge on lunch at a fancy restaurant, you can feed your whole family with one enchilada platter (that&#39;s how we do). Lastly, in New Mexico, chips + salsa come for free BEFORE your meal and sopapillas come for free WITH or AFTER - neither one is ever $5 a pop.On the upside, many of the dishes served here (posole, calabacitas, stuffed sopapillas) are genuine and unique to this restaurant in SF. I respect that the owners are bringing attention to the fact that (Yelp categories notwithstanding) New Mexican cuisine *is* a distinct cuisine, of which green chile is an important though not sufficient element. Unfortunately, I can&#39;t get over the pretentiousness of the prices and decor, which combine to form an inauthenticity unmitigated by the admittedly ideal sourcing of their namesake ingredient. New Mexican food is southern food both in the sense that it is comfort food and in the sense that you would NEVER pay $13 for fried chicken and a biscuit. Am I right? So why are you paying $15 for a burrito, ye hipster scum? I suppose for the same reason I might pay $12 for Kung Pao chicken, but I digress.Instead of coming here, make yourself a burrito and order your green chile from Hatch (elreyonline.com) directly. Then you can taste and BE as authentic as New Mexicans have been for hundreds of years.

The guy who was taking our order took 10 minutes to do so and left the register twice while taking our order to go do something else. As for the food, I am vegan and ordered accordingly, but when it came out, it had egg on it, so they re-made it and again, it came out with sour cream, I mean I said VEGAN and said no eggs, no dairy, no meat. Not only that, when the food finally came out right, it was 30 minutes from the time we placed our order. Then when I finally got my food, there was a pile of grease on the plate, so unappetizing. Additionally, they only had one bathroom, so there was a huge line. $12 for a pile of greasy bland food and huge wait time, no thank you!

I had a hardcore craving for tamales the other night--I&#39;m talkin&#39; HAAANGRY for some tamales. One of my friends pointed me toward Green Chile Kitchen and oh my lord I am so happy she did.I ordered one cheese and one pork tamale with &#34;Christmas&#34; chili (both green and red) and a side of refried beans and rice. To keep this short and sweet I&#39;ll just say that I was sad when my food was over. Absolutely delicious. The only issue I have now is knowing that these exist because I can&#39;t stop thinking about them.Thanks Green Chile Kitchen, you really helped a girl out.

I am updating my review again, a bit better than last time, still not good enough.I picked up an order of green chili stew and I got myself the standard grilled burrito with pork. The pork in the burrito was over half all fatty meat. Inedible mouthfuls of chewy gelatinous fatty pork chunks? While I&#39;m not completely disgusted I&#39;m definitely not pleased by the quality of meat.I&#39;ve eaten here so many times and the quality never seems to get any better. I miss the old days when it was so much better.And in this particular day I felt like the flavor of the burrito was also slightly off.I really want to like green chile kitchen because you can&#39;t get New Mexican cuisine just anyplace. Unfortunately over the years the place just can&#39;t hold up to the city standard.

This place is great, one of my favorites, and used to be 5 star. But, if there is any sort of line expect to wait at least 5 minutes PER PERSON to order. So frustrating. Something has got to be done to speed up ordering time. I would think it would be a priority of a restaurant like this to take people&#39;s money as fast as possible. I won&#39;t be coming back if there is any sort of line.

Pretty great. Wasn&#39;t expecting a lot as I&#39;m definitely more partial to the hole-in-the-wall type joints for my SF Mexican food, but this more than did the trick.A tad pricier than a lot of other options you&#39;ll find, but the food was definitely plentiful. I had a pork super burrito and it definitely filled me up. Came with chips and Sour Cream, Guac, and Pico on top, with a choice of beans.We were there pretty early (around 11am) and it had more than begun to fill up by the time we left. I can see why! Only complaint is that the service could have been a tad faster, but not too much of an issue at all.

Great ambiance but definitely overpriced for the quality of food. I found the enchiladas to be swimming in cheese and not a great balance of flavors. Salads are decent. Gluten-free consumers beware - the pozole has four in it, make sure to clarify you are actively avoiding gluten before ordering. Some waitstaff is more knowledgeable over others.

It&#39;s better than Chevy&#39;s or Chipotle but still Americanized yuppie Mexican food, virtually any place in the Mission is better for half the price. $90 for 4 without drinks. Yikes.And it&#39;s cafeteria style, which I can&#39;t blame the place for, but we sat down and wondered why for the longest time no one came over for anything. It was unexpected to have cafeteria dining in a yuppie/hipster atmosphere at those prices.If it were around the corner I&#39;d go back just because it&#39;s there and it&#39;s inoffensive, but no way as a destination would it even be a blip on my radar screen.And our order taker was really really stupid. She meant well, and was very pleasant, but could not understand simple math or the concept of &#34;what sides does the meal come with?&#34; Apparently the common phrase &#34;Your choice of X, Y, or Z -- P, D, and Q are optional extras at additional cost&#34; was not in her lexicon.

Each plate is work of art punching w color.The customer service is awesome. But lines can be brutal. When busy they are unable to do phone order aheads, which is rough because thats the best reason for phone ordering... To beat the lines.Nice house made drinks are a great touch.

I had lunch yesterday (Sunday) and it by far was the worst waste of money ever! Waited 50 minutes for my 2 tamales, which were cold and dry--no filling in one and maybe a half of a teaspoon in the other. The beans were like glue and also cold--the rice like gravel. I&#39;ve lived in the neighborhood since they opened, but this poor excuse for food was almost disgusting. $14.00 later plus tip and I couldn&#39;t even eat it. Once upon on a time it was great.

This place was recommended to me by the people I&#39;m staying with and I wish I went with one of the other options given to me.I ordered the two taco plate, one steak one chicken. The steak had good flavor however, the chicken had none, both tacos had very little in them and both shells broke while eating. The plate also came with rice and refried beans, the beans were piping hot and the rice was hard. Best part of my meal was the beer.Also, I&#39;m a stickler for customer service and this place lacked it, it took a while to get my food and when it was it was just thrown in front of me and was given no silverware, I had to ask a random bus boy that looked like he was on his break. I&#39;d go somewhere else if I were you.

My last visit witnessed a notable decline in quality here, or at least value. My &#34;smothered burrito&#34; was small and dry, and had a teeny squirt of red sauce, and one of green sauce. With tax, tip, and various nickle and dime charges (a tax for SF health care, an extra $1 for something else), this was $20 burrito, which was about $10 more that it was worth.

As someone who spent 17 years growing up in New Mexico and spent summers there during college, I&#39;m always craving green chile, quite possibly the world&#39;s greatest food. The problem is, as other native New Mexicans know, finding green chile outside of the state is almost impossible! What a sad world. Fortunately, I stumbled upon Green Chile Kitchen. They have it all - enchiladas, burritos, chile rellenos, green chile stew, posole, tortilla burgers and even sopaipillas. While the food - perhaps a little more refined - may not be exactly like my favorite hotspots in Santa Fe (such as Guadalupe Cafe) the food is still very good and authentic. The cashier even understood me when I requested Christmas for my chile. If you&#39;re from New Mexico or you have ever spent enough time in the state to fall in love with green chile, then eating at Green Chile Kitchen is a must!

We ordered this from postmates tonight.- Bowl of posole . I&#39;m not feeling well today so I wanted soup tonight &amp; was excited when I found a place with posole ... Unfortunately I was very underwhelmed with this one. There wasn&#39;t much pork in the soup and the broth just didn&#39;t have much flavor. I was also expecting it to come with cilantro, onions and some fix ins on the side but I got a lime slice that I didn&#39;t find til the end and some tortillas.- New Mexican smothered burrito. This was loaded with cheese so it was hard to taste anything but the green chili and cheese. The burrito is incredible spicy so if you&#39;re not good with spice I wouldn&#39;t recommend you try this. We had to refill our waters while eating because this was so spicy. It does come with rice, beans and some lettuce on the side so it&#39;s a good size meal though

This is a place where you never doubt if something will be good. We had two margaritas and a watermelon non-alcoholic drink it was amazing. Then we did guacamole a tamale and the half chicken. The flavors of all these dishes was very good. I really enjoyed the blue corn tamale.Service was good they have high chairs for the kiddies. You get your own water and utensils which is cool. Sit where you want and order and pay up front. This makes for a great flow. This place is a model for many other businesses they do it right here IMO.

In my head, everything with the word &#39;green&#39; has lots o&#39; vegetables but there&#39;s actually not that many veggies in this burrito! Don&#39;t be fooled!

Good location in Nopa and decided to try this place out for dinner one day after work.I am on the Whole30 diet and had the market salad with chicken. Since I couldn&#39;t have the dressing, I asked for olive oil and balsamic on the side. That never showed up. The salad just came by itself. Since I was so hungry and didn&#39;t want to wait around, I just used their Tapatio as my dressing instead. For what you get, it&#39;s super expensive. I can&#39;t believe I even tipped this place considering the service was no bueno.

The burrito I had the first time was also pretty good but wouldn&#39;t rival some of the best in the city.I will say that this is a bit pricey for Mexican food, but relatively to to other great tasting food I think it&#39;s great!Staff is nice and atmosphere is spacious and neighborhoody.

Authentic New Mexican food, and a nice twist on the typical Mexican fair you get elsewhere in SF. There is an emphasis on Green Chile (like duh), and I&#39;m not 100% sure if I&#39;m a fan, but it definitely is a nice change from other types of Mexican.The vibe of the place is relaxed, and you order up front at the counter. It can easily be the place where you hang out, or just eat and go.I had the quesadilla, which was good, but I think I did myself a disservice by not trying some of the more unique things. My friends had those items, and they definitely looked good!Service was quick and food was tasty.

It&#39;s really disappointing when you stumble across over priced Mexican food. This place is decent at best but $5.00 for chips and salsa? Are you serious? I should have just walked out but I just spent $18.95 on a burrito and a Diet Coke. That&#39;s insane. Jokes on me. But then again this is San Francisco and this is Nopa. Any hole in the wall Mexican joint in the mission makes this place seem comedic. I&#39;ll never come back here again.

Full Disclaimer: I absolutely love Mexican food and Green Chile Kitchen is only three blocks from my apartment, so I eat here all the time when I&#39;m home.However, this place is still FULLY deserving on five stars, and is one of my favorite (if not my favorite) restaurants in the city.I mean what&#39;s not to like? The staff is friendly, its convenient, they do take out, brunch, drinks, and of course lunch/dinner, so basically they have it all.As far as the food goes, I&#39;ve had their burritos, taco salads, enchiladas, tacos, and enchiladas and they&#39;ve all been good. But honestly I usually just get the stuffed sopaipillas with carne adovada and don&#39;t even bother with anything else - it&#39;s too good. By that I mean its my FAVORITE restaurant dish to order. Period.Carne adovada is basically slow-roasted pork braised in chili sauce, and as you can guess by their name, no one does chilies like &#34;Green Chile Kitchen&#34;. So my advice is to come here, order the carne adovada, and leave happy.

Green with envy.Who: Anyone watching me eat breakfast.Why: Homemade granola with pumpkin seeds, coconut oil, almonds, raisins and maple syrup with assorted berries was so good pretty sure it prompted spontaneous smiles.Comes with whole milk Straus yogurt. Know this only because the very friendly staff took a look. Served on the side. Turns out a bit of honey is all you need.Loved the $6 price almost as much as the final product. Unlike the last visit felt this was more than reasonable for such a delicious creation.Don&#39;t be envious. Just go.

I went here twice in 3 days, so that should say how much I liked it. Located within walking distance from USF so it&#39;s super convenient for college students. A coworker of mine took me here after work one day saying it&#39;s one of her faves... I ordered a burrito and a white sangria. THE SANGRIA IS THE BEST I&#39;VE HAD SINCE I&#39;VE MOVED TO SAN FRANCISCO. It&#39;s so sweet and fruity, you taste no alcohol, you can tell they let it marinate. And after my meal and drink, I spent the rest of my conversation throwing back $2 pacifico&#39;s. I enjoyed it so much that I brought my roommate back two days later haha.The only change I would make is to add a happy hour!

Apparently popular among USF students as it is in the vicinity, this is a New Mexican restaurant and I was impressed. It has a cool vibe the moment you walk in. It has a weekly specials menu on large poster paper with hand drawn artwork. It has self serve water that you get in mason jars.FOOD: I ordered the New Mexican homemade chicken enchilada. I did not add an egg, but I was tempted to. I ordered it with black beans and hot green chile. This was superb. Served with rice, lettuce, and sour cream, I was personally disappointed with the portion for the price of Mexican food. But the enchilada was delicious. The chicken was cooked well and went great with the cheese and the sauce. The black beans were especially flavorful but the rice was a bit lacking. But when you put everything together for one bite, it was amazing. I also got chips and Tomatillo avacado salsa. This was also very good. Not quite sure how to describe it, but it was hot, sour, salty, avocadoy all at the same time and it worked well.The only problem was the slight wait. It felt like the cashiers were in no rush despite the line going pretty much out the door. Despite this, I was fully impressed with the food and would definitely come back to try what else they have or just to have the enchilada again.

I can&#39;t keep living like this. Eating in San Francisco is gonna take me out of here. I get so ravenous for all of the offerings that I eat like my &#39;full sensation&#39; (that has, like, a real name, right?) doesn&#39;t work. And then I rub my big belly and sing &#39;Unpretty&#39; to myself. Vicious. But what do you do when there&#39;s pie to be eaten.Yes, pie. I get it that people come here for New Mexican fare. Bully for them. But if you&#39;re living right, it&#39;s all about pie &amp; ice cream. I live right. Armed with healthy scoops of Three Twins ice cream, I was ready to dig in to the pie choices of the day. But, the question beckons, what kind to have? This is why it&#39;s important to always travel to these places with friends: you can pick more than one dessert (and eat most of your friends&#39; selection). Because I have friends from New Mexico who raised me right, I opted for the green apple green chile pie. What?? I know! I talked my friend out of a chocolate selection and into another fruit concoction. She ordered the apricot blueberry pie.Healthy slices of warm pie, topped with top-notch ice cream and paired with coffee...is there a better way to end a day (food-wise, you awful perverted heathens)? I don&#39;t think so. True, this place is popular with families with small kids. Duh. Check the location and the fact that there&#39;s pie and ice cream on the menu. Come on a Tuesday and avoid the pitter pat of little ones, if that&#39;s a bother to/for you.

I&#39;ve tried so hard to like this place over the years. But time and time again it just disappoints (yes, I keep coming back because it&#39;s two blocks away and it has space to deal with kids and associated gear). The last time my chicken pozole soup was served with zero chicken, the time before my order was served cold, the time before that the cashiers were about as apathetic a team I&#39;ve ever experienced... It&#39;s pretty much par for the course. They know they have a captive audience of families with young kids that pack the place every night... and frankly just don&#39;t care that much about the food they serve or how it&#39;s served. Welcome to NOPAs overpriced New Mexican cafeteria...

This is a three stars purely on a one-time New Mexican cuisine dream gone bust, but I actually have high hopes for my next visit to Green Chile Kitchen. I&#39;m a guest in this city, so when my best friend told me &#34;we&#39;re going to have SW food!&#34; and I saw sopaipillas and red/green sauce on the menu, I was ecstatic: I miss ordering Christmas and getting me some New Mexican eats, after having some spent time out in the Land of Enchantment recently.But alas - the veggie stuffed sopaipillas were not of the same nostalgic calibre. Still, I enjoyed them. Good, well-seasoned medley of vegetables though somewhat lacking on the SW spice kick even with the Christmas sauce. Also, the portion here was actually much more manageable than the local-diner-grandma&#39;s-hosting-a-banquet oversized meals I had whenever I went out in NM.Looking forward to coming back. My friend&#39;s chile relleno burrito looked pretty dang good. And of course, I want sopaipillas, plain with a generous drizzle of honey. Noms. Wants now!

If you&#39;re completely new to New Mexican food, this is a good place to start -- in the Bay Area. If you&#39;re from New Mexico, this place just might irreparably piss you off. The food isn&#39;t half bad, but some of the variations border on sacrilegious, some are just weird. I always picture myself ordering the stuffed sopaipillas (all but unknown outside of NM), but strangely always settle on the crispy, blue corn tacos (arguably among the least New Mexican items on the menu). All told, the real drawbacks are economic (gougey pricing, sneaky, upchargey service), and not culinary. Give it a try, but come by my house later for the real deal. Bueno.

The food is good however for the type of dining that it is it about $3-5 overpriced! We came to try it out using a groupon so it was crazy crowded bc it seemed everyone else was trying to use it too before it expired. And the staff seemed really overwhelmed.There was a slight mix up with our order, where the cashier told us they were out of ribs. So we got the enchiladas instead. However, there&#39;s a $5 price difference and she didn&#39;t seem to want to give it to us. Which seemed shady since we still paid $30 after the groupon. But it ended up working out bc their was a misunderstanding and we did get both rib and enchiladas along with our other order.Overall this place is good just overpriced with slow service. And if dishes are costing $18 a plate call me uppity but I want a server!

I was born and raised in New Mexico and the red chile posole is authentic and fantastic, complete with blue corn tortillas.

Wow...well what can I say. As a native New Mexican I was thoroughly impressed with the decor and menu selection. It&#39;s order and sit down style which is cool for San Fran living. The salsas are spicy and flavorful. I ordered the two chile rellenos combo....which serves great when wanted to sample as much food as u can. Chicken posole was good, moist rice, great pinto beans, choice of mild or hot green chile, sopaipilla crisp and soft center, blue corn crispy taco. Quite the experience, I have fallen inlove with this restaurant. Highly, highly recommended.:-)

A great Mexican restaurant. I had there green chile enchiladas which were fantastic. My husband ordered the green chile stew with pork, and loved it. Their guacamole was mediocre and rice was undercooked. Plan on coming back!

Awesome New Mexican food, turnaround time and cafeteria style with great service. They have a pickup counter for to-go orders which is key.They once forgot one item in our takeout order, we called to let them know, and they personally drove all the way to our place within ten mins with our food and extras. Loved that service!One of our weekly staples for a quick, delicious meal!

I think it is ludacris that this place doesn&#39;t have a higher star rating. Are you people accidentally hitting the wrong button?Don&#39;t be deterred, the food is great and the only thing worth complaining about is the open seating - get over it - this is SF, things like that happen.I had the enchilada with an egg on top and it pretty much blew my mind. Between that, the beans and rice, and the neighborhood restaurant atmosphere, this place is on point.Pick what you want, go to the counter, order it up, and you&#39;ll be feasting in no time.

Came her for dinner around 7pm on a Tuesday and the place was packed. My fiance and I each ordered an entree (no drinks, apps or anything else), it came out to about $40. Pretty expensive for a place where you order at the counter from a girl who gives plenty of attitude and blatantly hates her job.I&#39;d gladly pay $40 for hot, fresh, tasty food. That is not what we got. The refried beans were cold and crusty, seemed like they had been sitting out all day. The mashed potatoes were also cold and seemed like they had been sitting out all day. The avado pork had a pretty decent sauce on it but I could only eat about half of the serving they gave me because the pork was so covered in slimy, gross fat.The rotisserie chicken was good but so is the organic rotisserie chicken you can get at Safeway for $6. There is nothing special about this place at all. It is LOUD, packed with families w/ small screaming children. I think it gets so busy because it&#39;s easily accessible to the families who live in that area. There aren&#39;t too many restaurant choices on that block but it&#39;s well worth going down to Divis and getting a good meal. Will not ever be returning!

So depressing: more sublime regional ethnic cuisine &#34;adapted&#34; to accommodate and please pale palates.Go there if you want bland burritos for twice the price and half the flavor of any taqueria in the mission. New Mexico is known for the variety and forceful assertiveness of its chiles. Where?

Being half-Mexican, I am a Mexican food snob. (Sometimes even an American food snob...) Things that are covered in cheese and sour cream are not really authentic. This place, well it&#39;s like a hipster foodie version of traditional Mexican.I hadn&#39;t tried blue corn tortillas before this visit, but I feel robbed that I have lived 25 years without them. They are delicious on their own.Why come here? Decent parking around the area, not very crowded, and the food is super good.

Favorite Mexican (specifically New Mexican) restaurant in San Francisco! I don&#39;t know how this place doesn&#39;t have better ratings. I&#39;m a regular here - probably stop by a couple of times a month.The food is absolutely delicious, especially if you are a green chile lover! The burritos are very large and incredibly delicious and my personal favorite - the corn chowder - is to die for. The salads are also fantastic if you are trying to avoid an especially heavy meal. To be honest, the only dish I&#39;ve had here that wasn&#39;t great was the &#34;burger&#34; (ground beef patty wrapped in a tortilla).Prices are very reasonable and orders are taken at a pair of registers as you enter and then you are given a number to help the waitstaff find you. This place is often packed for dinner and there are no reservations (seating is self serve) so plan ahead and keep an eye peeled to grab a table when one opens up!

Okay so this place isn&#39;t as ~authentic~ as the places in the Mission in terms of flavors, etc. but it&#39;s a great restaurant if you&#39;re simply craving Mexican food of any sort. Steak tacos were good but a little bit too salty and watery--the watery-ness made the tortillas soggy which made the tacos fall apart which made me sad. I mean they still tasted fine but it looked messy. I like that they have lots of veg options for people who are into that. Service was nice. The water cups are really cool. I&#39;d love to come back here someday and try some of the other stuff on their menu!

I&#39;m first to admit, spending a couple of days in New Mexico does not make an expert on green chili. But I did get exposed to this legendary Southwestern salsa. And yes, it&#39;s as awesome as advertised. You can throw a rock down the street and hit 39 places that make fantastic green chili.However, the same cannot be said for San Francisco. Green Chili Kitchen is the latest in a long line of failed attempts to recreate New Mexico style chili.It&#39;s not just the less than average chili that makes this place a &#34;no go&#34;. The high prices, the stand in line and place your order, trying to find a table afterwards and then discovering you want a another drink and having to get back in that line all over again. Meanwhile, your hot chili has turned cold.Go if you must, but if you have sampled green chili in NM, you will be greatly disappointed.

Tonight for dinner we had the chips and 4 salsas, pazole, enchilada and horchata. The chips were delicious as well as the salsas which ranged from mild to spicy. The pazole was delicious. A little oily at first but the flavors were amazing and it was really tasty. The enchilada was good as well, and I&#39;d recommend getting half red half green sauce so that you can sample both. I&#39;ve had better horchatas, but this was still good. The ambiance was casual and seems like a good place to hang out for all ages. Not &#34;blow my socks off&#34; delicious, but definitely a solid 4 stars.

This is a &#34;order at the counter and get a number for your table&#34;-sort of place.Positives (+):(+) Cool vibe and atmosphere(+) Very authentic New Mexican food, as I was sitting at a table with some New Mexican food experts(+) Stuffed poblanos with ground beef, roasted corn, cheese. Really good. I&#39;d recommend. I did ask for a side of sour cream to add to it though, and it was even better with the sour cream.(+) The enchilada - order the fried egg with it! Really good, I&#39;m getting it next time.(+) Green chile pork burrito looked really good, although I didn&#39;t try it myself.Negatives (-):(-) The rice that accompanied my dish was really dry, like it had been sitting out for a while(-) Sangria was only okay

cute spot. solid new mexican food. airy space. no huge lines. Love the new Mexican flavors of fresh chili and fresh ingredients without weighing your stomach down. I also like the casual neighborhood feel to the place.The green chili stew is amazing, invigorating kick of the green chill with chunky chicken. Fantastic start to any meal. The sopaipillas (fluffy fried dough) was surprisingly delightful, especially for someone who is a low-carb eater- it has to be amazingly delicious to break the norm. Lightly fried, crunchy and fluffy at the same time.I also like the best of everything green salad. Solid. The mesclun leaves are really fresh. The carrots could be better - better to cut them fresh to mix in the salad. Like the dressing.

Pluses: The atmosphere was nice and it wasn&#39;t crowded on the Saturday we went. I like that can order at the counter and then the food it brought out to you. When I asked for some tortillas to compliment the beans on my plate, then kitchen staff gladly obliged. Prices were reasonable.Minues: While the menu items looked enticing, the food was rather bland. I ordered the quinoa stuffed peppers. Basically just tasted like unseasoned quinoa and the peppers it was in. Would not go back for the food.

Definitely try the sweet potato tamale and quinoa stuffed poblano. Both are SO good and are dished your don&#39;t find often, or if you do, they&#39;re not made this well. They have some tasty salsas as well. Plus, the dishes come with cactus, rice and beans so you get a variety of foods and it fills you up.I ordered this for delivery, so I don&#39;t know what the actual restaurant is like, but speaking just in terms of the food, it&#39;s delicious, filling, and delicious again.

I liked this place, I&#39;m trying to figure out why I&#39;m hesitant to give it a full 5 stars and I think it&#39;s because the red chile chicken soup I ordered was a little too spicy. ha but that&#39;s knit-picking obviously, everything else was great. I loved the blue corn tortillas (best corn tortillas I&#39;ve ever had) and it was fun to have the water glasses be glass mason jars. It&#39;s a serve yourself feel- you order at the counter and you get your own water and silverware, but the cool feel of the restaurant made up for it. Slight hipster but not in an &#34;in your face&#34; kind of way so it wasn&#39;t too over the top. ha overall great place, just don&#39;t order the soup if you don&#39;t like spicy food.

So, I live literally a 10 second walk from this place and have lived near it for 3 years. I&#39;ve had a love/hate relationship with it. The first item I ever ordered was a breakfast burrito. It was tasty, but it was small and overpriced. It barely filled me up and that&#39;s unacceptable. The breakfast burrito from Beanbag Cafe on Divis or the breakfast wrap from Oasis Cafe are way better.I found out a few months back that they offer a burger. Well, I ordered it for take out and it&#39;s actually very flavorful. You get the cheese burger wrapped in a tortilla with green chiles on top and the condiments on the side. Fresh lettuce onion and tomato. The fries are these seasoned crinkle cut ones.I went here last night to sit down and have a $2 pacifico. I was going to order the burger but I wanted to revisit the enchilada after he said it was bigger portions than the burger. It was a decent square sized slice of enchilada that had &#34;succulent&#34; chicken. Small side salad with pico de gallo and rice and beans on the side. I was satisfied. The hot green chiles were as warned, hot, but that&#39;s what I wanted.This place is a happening spot and is always pretty busy but not too busy. They also have a big screen TV now. I can honestly admit now that I like this place. Who cares if my ex got a crappy salad from here one time.

cafeteria/family style seating with some booths and pairs tables. it is efficient. The food is good, if overpriced for new Mexican/(read heavy on the chile&#39;s but effectively Mexican food.) a taco plate = $13 which seems a bit rich for three tacos and refried beans and rice.Don&#39;t know if I&#39;ll be returning, as I really don&#39;t feel like I can justify the cost for the food. I have had and do often get as good of food at the local taqueria (like zona rosa)

I moved to SF after living in NM for almost 20 years. The apple pie was good, but the food is seriously overpriced for the taste. If you want New Mexican food, take a road trip to New Mexico. SF (and especially the East Bay) has amazing Mexican and Central American food. Go patronize legit places, not this hipster imitation.

GREAT New Mexican food. It&#39;s pretty casual and cash only. When we went they were offering $2 Pacifico&#39;s- score. Between the 4 of us, we loved everything. The tamale appetizer was good w/ great sauce and seeds. We also had an order of guac. The rotiserre chicken is juicy and I loved the side dishes of squash, corn etc. We had dishes with both green and red chili. They give you a choice of black or pinto beans and white or brown rice. Nice.After our meal, we also walked a block to Chili Pies (pretty sure they are related somehow). Good ice cream selection and both pies we tasted were yummy.

I like the space: It&#39;s roughhewn industrial chic with a New Mexican bent with lots of red and dark wood. They certainly quintupled the space they had at their prior location.The food is good, the crispy tacos I&#39;ve had seem a bit light on the meat (you can get pork, steak, chicken) and the guacamole is good and chunky served with thick and crispy (tastes like) house made tortilla chips.I feel the entrees are a touch expensive but then again, you can order small plates if you&#39;re looking to spend just a few dollars for reasonably healthy fare.Green Chile Kitchen&#39;s settled into the neighborhood nicely; I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll head over there once or twice a month for a quick bite and maybe try their brunch.

I live around the corner from this place, so I&#39;ve eaten here quite a few times in the past few years. Everything is a pretty solid option. My go to is usually the vegetarian burrito with calabacitas and hot green chile. I love the chips and salsa appetizer too and usually get the 4 salsa sampler. They&#39;re all so delicious!There sister restaurant/dessert place is one block down the hill and they have free wi-fi and amazing desserts. I sometimes get take-out at green chile kitchen and take it down to chile pies to work.It&#39;s a good staple restaurant in the area.

I was recommended to this place by my roommate so was really excited to finally try it. I ordered take-out and got the chicken soft tacos, guacamole appetizer, and my friend got the 1/4 chicken with salad.First off, the guacamole wasn&#39;t even in the bag (which was $8) but was paid for on the receipt. Frustrating... I&#39;m not going to get in my car and park to go back to get something they left out.The tacos would have gotten a 5/5 if I would have gotten the correct number. The plate should come with 3 tacos and I only got two. I was starving so this was disappointing especially after they forgot the guac appetizer as well. I was supposed to get 3 tacos and I only got two. The chicken was tender and the guac was good. The tortillas were interesting but falling apart so they were hard to eat. I was still hungry after eating these two very small tacos and every morsel of the 1/2 cup of rice on my plate.The 1/4 chicken and salad actually looked like a lot of better of an option since it came with the salad, tortillas, rice and beans. Much more of a meal than mine.I may go back here if friends were to dine-in but definitely not worth the price and take-out was obviously poor.

This one was just not my &#39;cup of tea&#39;...The plates look very pretty and contemporary, but we were just missing that deep flavor of an authentic Mexican meal. We had the sweet potato tamale appetizer. The flavor combination just did not work for me. For our entrees we had the burrito and the chile relleno plate. Both dishes were good, but a little too contemporary for my taste.All in all, it&#39;s decent food on a more contemporary side. Price/Service wise - I felt it was a little on the pricey side for a self-order place with very limited seating.

We are big fans of the green chile group of restaurants (especially the chile pies).Their salads always hit the kale-loving spots in us with the recent kale and beet salad perfectly filling that role. Our other order of carne asornado was really just okay. We wished it had more spice or bold flavors somehow. The sopaipillas were absolutely delicious and fresh though. Not a bad meal although not one we&#39;ll be craving anytime soon.Overall, we think we&#39;ll stick with their traditional chile pie and salads.

Ordered food from here from Try Caviar. I like how there are unique vegetarian options here (but I guess it&#39;s a norm for fancy Mexican restaurants?). Anyway, they have tamales stuffed with sweet potatoes (yum!) and peppers stuffed with quinoa (I think you can tell that I like things stuffed haha!). My coworker also really liked their salads so, a plus in my eyes!

Best stew I&#39;ve ever had, best flour tortillas I&#39;ve ever had, best tacos I&#39;ve ever had. I&#39;m partial to the pork version of the stew and the ground beef version of the tacos, but every version of everything I&#39;ve eaten here has been SO good I come back multiple times a week. 5 delicious stars, yes

This place has good food. Nothing fantastic, but it&#39;s fine. Also the price is reasonable.HOWEVER. they will mess up your order. I have gone on several occasions and my order is wrong every time. I ask for sour cream, there is no sour cream. I ask for refried beans, I get black beans. The last time I was there, they added hot chilies inside my burrito, I couldn&#39;t even finish the first bite!! Really not worth it. From now on, I&#39;ll just go elsewhere for Mexican.

Is this possible? Christmas all year round in SF?New Mexican cuisine is famous for their &#34;Christmas&#34; sauce -- red and green chile sauces atop savory dishes. The fact that there&#39;s a resto here in my own city where I can get this? Oh, definitely TOPS.The bold red color on the walls matched with the wood furniture add layers of warmth to an airy space. Picture windows slide open to let the breeze in. From the booth we were sitting, I could see the rotisserie oven which held my breakfast captive.Fulton Valley Chicken. Never. Looked. So. Good.Since I already had breakfast at home, I decided to stick to a smaller sized serving. Breakfast tacos are priced at $3.95 each with a choice of beef or chicken. Chopped lettuce, fresh tomatoes, mild green chile sauce and sprinkling of four cheeses rounds up my simple meal. Freshly prepared and delicious. My friend&#39;s steak burrito is big enough to kill those hunger pangs but with nicely seasoned meat, scrambled eggs and melted cheese, how could it not?I&#39;m excited for the next time so I can taste more of their menu items. Posole. Tamale plate. Sopaipilla. Red chile sauce. Green Chile sauce. I can seriously get this without going to Santa Fe?Sure looks like Christmas here in SF.

Delish! I had the tacos since I wasn&#39;t hungry thinking they&#39;d be small (they weren&#39;t) but I ended up eating everything anyway. Excellent food and good house red wine.The only negative was the atmosphere at dinnertime (7ish) on a weeknight. I guess isn&#39;t a review of the establishment so much as irresponsible SF parents, but there seemed to be a lot of parents letting their kids run wild up and down the aisles and nearly knocking over glasses, trays, etc. I didn&#39;t realize this would be the scene here. However. amazing food and I want to go back and try more.

Short version:Great atmosphere. Great food (but quality/taste can take the occasional dip). Service is good. Make sure to check your to-go orders before heading out. Pricy.Long version:I have a bit of a love/hate relationship with this place. First off: the food is great! At least most of the time. Occasionally the meat in my burrito will suddenly be chewy and not as flavorful as i&#39;m used to. It&#39;s worth taking the risk though, since when done right, Green Chile Kitchen serves the best burritos in town. Hands down. Just keep in mind that you&#39;ll be paying around $12 for one.One consistent issue has been them getting the order right when ordering over the phone for pickup. My wife is allergic to avocado and I can&#39;t tell you how many times we&#39;ve called in an explicit &#34;no avocado!&#34; order only to come home and find avocado/guac in her burrito.They seem to have heard our feedback tho and it hasn&#39;t been an issue the last few times we ordered. Hence 4 stars instead of 3.P.s. Just in case a staff member is reading this... Please add a little more cheese to the beet/kale salad. All the right ingredients are there, but in it&#39;s current state it&#39;s rather boring.

One word: BlandI got the vegetarian burrito dinner with tofu. Burrito was covered in the red sauce - it was practically flavorless, as were the black beans (and I ordered pinto beans). The tofu was pretty good.My friend got the 1/4 chicken dinner. He said it was pretty bland. His beans were bland too. The potatoes covered in cheese (he ordered without cheese) - not overly flavorful.Total cost for these two items w/tax: $30Note: perhaps our flavor buds were a bit off b/c we just had sex an hour ago but I am pretty sure that wasn&#39;t the case. This was my second time there and I was hesitant to go b/c I wasn&#39;t impressed the first time. There won&#39;t be a third time for sure - I&#39;ve had my fill of not so great but expensive New Mexican food.

Delicious, fresh, great, refined Mexican food, not your typical Mexican joint..The only problem is that very often they mess up my order.This one last time my friend was almost done with his food and mine had not even been started (I was watching). I had to remind them. This happened three tomes already, yes three times.The food is fantastic. I am a vegetarian, and I love it here!The kitchen needs better organizing.

Solid Mexican food - nothing out of this world but consistently good and not overly greasy or sauce smothered (unless requested...). You order at the counter and then the food is brought to your table which is not immediately apparent upon arriving at the restaurant.The margaritas looked good, the tacos I had were yummy and the atmosphere is clean and lively. It gets pretty busy around dinnertime and can be challenging to locate a table immediately.There are definitely better Mexican places in SF and even close by but its a good option for a more varied menu.

I&#39;ve been here several times now (ah, the convenience of living two blocks away) and just learned that Green Chile Kitchen is a New Mexican restaurant. As in &#34;New Mexico&#34; the state. Not &#34;new Mexican&#34; like a new take on traditional Mexican food. Mind = blown. Guess you do learn something new every day.Anyway, I&#39;ve had a variety of dishes here, from the veggie quesadilla to the carne adovada to the chile relleno, and I&#39;ve always been satisfied. After a brief wait in line (there is always a line - which I think is a good thing), you order at the counter and bring your number to an open table. Service has always been prompt and friendly, and portions are sizable and fairly priced - actually I think cheaper than some other SF options of equal quality. Atmosphere is lively and usually there is everyone from singles to families, so it makes for good people watching. Alcoholic drink options are wine, beer and your classic mimosas and margaritas. Go for the house red, you won&#39;t be disappointed.I will be back, because - well - obviously I already have.

I can&#39;t believe this place only has 3.5 stars, I love this place! When I lived nearby I called it my cafeteria!Chicken enchiladas are the best! The soups, especially the posole, rock my world! Saldas are good. Burritos decent, but there are better out there for sure. Except for the breakfast burrito--that is a solid breakfast.I also love that they serve good quality meat here--Mary&#39;s chicken and Niman ranch Beef. Also, Blue Bottle Coffee.

We walked over on a sunny Saturday afternoon for an early-ish lunch. Little did we know that the rest of NOPA would be finishing (or just starting) their brunches, but the place was packed, and there was a line (quite literally) out the door. So there was a little hassle getting our order in, a little wait until a space for the three of us opened up, and a little hassle getting a high chair from the far end of the restaurant, but in the end all was well.I ordered the quarter chicken dinner, which comes with rice, beans, salsa, and a huge tortilla (probably meant for a burrito). The chicken is truly delicious. Crispy, juicy, and super-flavorful. That you can get a whole one with rice &amp; beans for $20 is a deal I need to keep in mind for the future.I&#39;m really eager to come back soon - the rest of the menu looks fantastic, especially the pozole, the tamales, and the sopapillas.

For all you yelpers monitoring and following my reviews and get a laugh or two about my continuing and record-breaking burrito-journey, I came here for a &#34;Breakfast Burrito&#34;. It counts, right?At first I thought this NOPA neighborhood was all residential. &#34;Boy, was I wrong!&#34;There are some lively businesses here as well, including this huge corner New Mexican restaurant. From the outside of the restaurant, I can smell the chicken being cooked on the huge rotisserie cooker.Inside the place has a kitchen (Taqueria-style) on the right and a cool wine bar on the left. Cashier is in the middle as I walk in. And I ordered the Chicken Breakfast Burrito. For $8.00, I get a lean chicken meat, which is from Fulton Valley and made from the aforementioned rotisserie cooker, scrambled eggs, potato chunks and Pico de Gallo sauce in a flour tortilla with green chile, guacamole and sour cream as toppings. My burrito was loose on a plate with an artful presentation. Tastewise, the meat was lean and smoky with a noticeable rotisserie flavor. I also added a Limon Jarrito to wash my burrito down.Remember, &#34;Breakfast is the most important meal of the day&#34;.&#34;So eat a burrito!&#34;I did and I will definitely come back and again eat the breakfast burrito and other foods from the restaurant.

This is the kind of food I can eat all the time. Although my body might protest. Mmm mmm New Mexican cuisine.So I&#39;m a huge fan of Chile Pies (their pie place just a few doors down) and finally decided to stop in Green Chile Kitchen for a Saturday lunch. Nice place, clean, feels New Mexican with a more muted color scheme. The first thing that stood out were the prices. Poor college student visiting SF for the weekend = not a lot of options.I ended up buying a single tamale that cost $4. However, it was an outstanding tamale. Made with blue corn and topped with some of their Chile Honey, I was pretty satisfied. My friend ordered a $6 burrito that I nibbled on and it was also delicious. If I had not had a piece of pie after, I probably would have been hungry still. Most of the plates I would have preferred to order were between $11 - $14, which would have been fine if I was ordering dinner.Of course, this place serves yummy sangria and Blue Bottle coffee. Win. Staff is helpful and friendly. Never seems too crowded whenever I&#39;ve walked by and we found a place to sit pretty easily. If you&#39;re willing to spend a few more bucks, then this place is great!

I like it! I&#39;ve had a Living Social deal waiting to be used and I also saw the restaurant on Check Please, so its been on my to-go list for quite awhile. I had a good experience here.This was my first time trying food from New Mexico, and it was good! My boyfriend had the Carne Adovada and I wish I had ordered that- the flavors were SO good. I was less impressed with my green chile enchiladas, but the tamale was pretty good. We decided to stick around and order dessert, and we tried the Sopapillas. They were pretty good.I really want to come back and try a few more items on the menu. :)

I am a native New Mexican and all I have to say is they&#39;re doing it wrong. The green chile flavor is decent with a good amount of heat considering we are not in New Mexico However, everything else is incorrect. The sopapaillas are sad--not puffy and are over cooked, and the enchiladas are layered, not rolled, with unmelted cheese throughout. The tamale was also a sad attempt. This attempt at New Mexican food was disappointing, especially considering the SF price tag. The food is isn&#39;t bad, but it isn&#39;t New Mexican as advertised.

I LOVE this place - tried them for the first time for lunch delivery at work and then decided to stop by their NOPA location.

Bigger space feels more intimate and cozy. Now serving alcohol but I wish their sangria was stronger. Red chile is better than the green, but I went xmas style to try them both. Creamy vegetarian refried beans make me happy. Try the enchilada with veggies; more like blue corn tortillayum.Can be too pricey :(.

Earlier, in the library, my friend came up to me and inquired as to why I was surrounded by day quil, ricoloa, emergen-c, tissues, and why I sounded like a duck.&#34;I&#39;m ill. And I don&#39;t mean fly. I mean sick.&#34;&#34;Omg how did that happen!?&#34;*Blank stare.* &#34;... Well... a virus got into my body through an air passage and started multiplying and is currently ransacking my bloodstream. That&#39;s how that happened.&#34;&#34;Oh. Well... what are you going to do about your dinner tonight?&#34;&#34;Uh..... Hope hot mess is back in style?&#34;Turns out, hot mess is back in style. But I&#39;m generally a hot mess so that goes with the territory.I really wanted a super burrito, and had to be in the area post dinner, so I picked this place for a [things I don&#39;t go on] date. I had been looking forward to a burrito and a beer for a week. But because I was down with the sickness, I got green chile chicken stew only to realize... I couldn&#39;t taste anymore. Which caused quite a bit of an internal chaos.Getting to the actual substantive review, this place wasn&#39;t like I imagined it, it was far more rustic, refined, and moderately priced. It was unexpected, but I was pleasantly surprised.Anyway, I ate my soup trying to not look like I was panicking (I was) and simultaneously trying to look like I could breathe. (I couldn&#39;t.) And about half way through dinner I realized my neck gland was swollen to the size of a ping pong ball- at which point I realized my meds were wearing off, I was loopy, and I wanted to go home and go to bed ASAP.I&#39;m going back once I have an appetite and can taste things.

My credentials: I grew up in New Mexico. I love New Mexican food, and I love green chile.We came here for dinner one night, myself being pretty darn excited to eat some of my home-state&#39;s star crop. The atmosphere is earthy and trendy, but what frustrated me immediately upon arrival was the lack of instruction about what to do. Several people were waiting in a line, some people sitting on the bench by the line, some people milling about. I was the first of my party to arrive, so I took a shot and got in line.The restaurant was buzzing, and as I looked around at the dearth of open tables, I started to realize that I was doing something wrong. It seems that the frequent customers knew how to cheat the system, and upon arriving, would send one of their group to claim a rare table while the rest of them stood in line to order food. I watched as table after table became occupied by patrons who had arrived AFTER me. This may fly for a casual lunch thing, but certainly wasn&#39;t appropriate for a dinner situation.Luckily once I placed my order, I was able to claim a free table. The margarita I ordered was delicious, but that&#39;s the only thing I would come back for.When my friends finally arrived, they had to stand in line for a while to place their order as well. When the runner brought us our food, he did not bring silverware, and we had to get it from the self-serve area at the front of the restaurant. Again...not appropriate!The food itself was okay. For the price, it&#39;s definitely not worth it. If you&#39;re hardcore craving New Mexican food, still not worth it.I certainly did not feel taken care of, and actually felt pretty duped (both by the restaurant and the familiar patrons). I&#39;ll save my money for the plane flight home.

Delicious. I usually only go to Yelp 4 star and above. I&#39;m going to change that because this place is fabulous. Fell in love with New Mexico green chili when traveling. Theirs is every bit as delicious. Also, I rarely eat tortillas, but I took a taste of one and couldn&#39;t stop.

Green Chile&#39;s food is pretty basic.Healthy Mexican fare.They carry brown rice and their meat fillings are fresh and local and not drowned out by heavy greasy sauces or cheese.My veggie burrito here was decent and light. The spicy green ranchero sauce drizzled upon it - tied it all together well.But the real standout was the mixed berry pie. Big juicy dark berries squeezed into a soft doughy buttery crust. I had the vegan horchata ice-cream with it as well. The ice-cream was fairly bland tasting, but the pie was packed with home-made excellence.If you want some light healthy mexican dishes - Green Chile has a nice assortment of choices. But it you want to be wowed - just go for the pie.Trust.

If food had been this good when growing up in New Mexico, I might have reconsidered relocating. There wasn&#39;t anything that we had that wasn&#39;t shy of delicious. We started with a Yerba Matte White Sangria, which is if not the best sangria I have ever had. It was defintly the best white sangria to date. Then we moved on to the dos quesos 7 layer dip, which is nothing like the dip you encounter at pot lucks. This was arrived in a hot iron gridlle with fresh tortilla chips on the side.Then on to one of the newest additions to the menu which was the stuffed pepper with quinoa. If you are looking for a healthier option, this is a great one.My only regret is that I was so stuffed from all the above, it left no room for sopiapllas. OH well, I guess I must return.

I read about how they mess up all the orders and figured I was safe since there&#39;s only 8 people here on a Sunday morning. Well, they totally got my order wrong. I told the lady behind the bar, she went to the kitchen and never came back to me.

I wished I&#39;d discovered this place sooner, I would have been here frequently if I had! If you need a green chili fix this is your place. The chips and salsas with four varieties of salsa is tasty. The burrito is huge and very tasty. The enchiladas were SPICY but also very good. If you can&#39;t take the heat get out of the green chili kitchen I guess.Very casual place, order and pay first then sit down your food is delivered to your table. Get your own water and utensils. There can be a wait for dinner but they are fast at getting orders out. This is definitely a place that you go to for the food not necessarily the ambiance.

I&#39;ll give it a fair shot too, and if they earn five stars that&#39;s what they&#39;ll get.I just got one of the best letters I&#39;ve ever read from the General Manager of this restaurant. He acted with such integrity and class - I was really floored. He took full responsibility, acknowledged the disappointment, and offered a personal resolution - a gift to my brother-in-law for his birthday. Whoa. I instead intend to give Green Chile another chance, because we all have bad days. I&#39;m looking forward to posting a new review.It&#39;s always nice to run across a business that is run with integrity. Although I still acknowledge that I had a bad experience on my initial visit, the management has already shown that they take customer satisfaction seriously and have made a genuine attempt to make me feel heard and taken care of.

I really wanted to like it. But you see, I just got back from Las Cruces and I am a picky bastard that can&#39;t be pleased unless you offer me exactly what I want:A chile relleno burrito, with Hatch chiles. It should just be a relleno, with refried beans, in a flour tortilla.The chile was fine! It did the trick. Why did I only get one seed? Nooooooo.Rice! Whole pintos, not refried! The foul offering of sour cream, guac! Green chile salsa on top that was kinda bell peppery! Those things are FIIIINE on a California burrito, don&#39;t yell at me, it&#39;s just that&#39;s not what I wanted, I wanted a real New Mexico relleno burrito and I didn&#39;t get it so I&#39;m leaving an A-OK review.The rest of you that don&#39;t care if it&#39;s strictly NM cuisine - you&#39;ll be fine, it&#39;s good.

I want to say upfront that the missing star is only due to the prices, which I just find ridiculous. I ordered a veggie burrito and a kale salad to go and it was $20.Now that the whining about over priced food is over, I will absolutely come back next time I&#39;m in my old neighborhood again just for the kale salad with quinoa, jicama and this amazing spicy dressing. The veggie burrito was pretty yummy, but nothing special. They moved to a larger location since when I lived up the street, and though it&#39;s not as cozy and intimate as the last place, its Mexican rustic decor works well. Definitely not a spot I&#39;ll go out of my way for, but a good place for a yummy salad when convenient.

Great burrito spot. They get busy on the weekends all day, but if you&#39;re looking for a take home order this is the best! Call in, get the spicy salsa and pick up in 15 mins.

Ordered three dishes: Chile Relleno Plate, Half Chicken Dinner and Seven Layer Dip.Tried one entree with re-fried and the other with black beans. Both beans were well done, classic flavors. The rice just tastes like it&#39;s mixed with tomato sauce, otherwise not much flavor. The chicken was underwhelming and a bit dry (better rotisserie chickens at Haight Street Market). The dip was tasty and simple. The relleno had a nice batter and was cooked well with a flavorful, spicy green chile sauce. Overall, for the price there are much better restaurants.

If anything i would give the place 2.5 stars based on food. The food was at par and didn&#39;t have anything that wow&#39;ed me in any way. The ingredients tasted fresh and wasn&#39;t the type where I knew I would sitting on the toilet all night.I got the spicy burrito which was not spicy. The place is expensive for a burrito that is just decent.

I&#39;m giving this place four stars because of their rotisserie chicken. It is sooooo good! The skin is flavorful, and the meat is juicy. Love it.The burritos and enchiladas are good; they&#39;re nothing super special, but they&#39;re really good. The rotisserie chicken won me over.

The adovado I ordered did not taste as New Mexican as I had hoped so I was disappointed. It was still ok, but a little dry and a little bland.I ordered to go and it was a decent wait - not too slow. The decor was nice and there was a good amount of open seating.

A Double O restaurant - Overrated and Overpriced! NAfter reading the numerous 4 &amp; 5 star reviews, I was anxious to give this &#34;New Mexican&#34; restaurant a try as their website mentioned that they had the chile&#39;s flown in from New Mexico.We went there for lunch and ordered the flat chicken enchiladas &#34;Christmas&#34; and the cheese tamales. Two entree&#39;s no drinks, over $30 for lunch.With Christmas you&#39;re supposed to get equal parts red and green chile, my plate was more like 3/4 red and 1/4 green. The red sauce tasted watered down and was not the normal NM dark red earthy color, the green chile which I could taste was tasteless. Both sauces were bland and barely lukewarm.Didn&#39;t taste the tamales but I did not see any cheese only two cylinders of blue corn masa.Pros -found parking within half a block.Cons -Bland tasting red and green chileNo substitution of beans so they gave additional rice and lettuceCold and old rice, some grains must have been @ least a couple days old as they were hard and dehydratedPrice for the quality of foodCounter ordering and they bring your food, everything else you&#39;re on your ownWill Not be back or recommend to anyone seeking true New Mexican food.

This review is only for Green Chile&#39;s breakfast - which was great! Definitely a tasty Mexi spot right by Divis. I recently visited a friend in SF and she said this is her go-to breakfast burrito spot. Works for me! I had the spicy chorizo breakfast burrito and added guac. My ONLY complaint is that they put the guac on top. I guess I just assumed it would come on the inside when I said &#34;add guac, no potatoes.&#34; Well, I guess I that&#39;s what I get for being an annoying substituting customer. Anyway, the burrito was awesome! Quite hearty and very filling. I don&#39;t know that I would call the chorizo &#34;spicy,&#34; but it was still good.It might not be the most authentic Mexican food, but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s what Green Chile is going for anyway. I really liked that the food seemed relatively healthy... Well, as healthy as you can get with a massive Mexican burrito, haha. Basically, I didn&#39;t feel greasy or totally food-bombed afterward. The coffee was really good too. That was my first cup o&#39; Blue Bottle Coffee, good stuff!We also walked by the restaurant on Saturday night. The place was PACKED. I also love the open, airy layout of the space. Much fancier than most of the Mexican joints I usually frequent :) Maybe next time I will have a chance to come in for dinner!

Good Southwestern food. They&#39;re known for their Posole, and it was quite tasty. Also got a sweet potato tamale. The filling was excellent, but as with most tamales, the ratio of filling to corn shell skewed too much to the shell for my taste.

This is one of my neighborhood spots.It&#39;s order at the counter, grab your number and find an open table.The pork at GCK is delicious. I love it on top of the nachos or in the green chile roasted burrito.I love that GCK gives you lots of options -- type of beans, hot or mild chile, etc. Opt for the hot.If you&#39;re still hungry after dinner I highly recommend walking one block for a slice of pie at Chile Pie and Ice cream.

Since writing my original review during a visit to San Francisco in 2010 I have recently relocated a few blocks away from Green Chile Kitchen. The proximity has been great for allowing me many opportunities to try different things on their menu. I came for Brunch once, which I never would have thought to do in the past (Mexican food for brunch!?) and had a kick-ass breakfast burrito which I would highly recommend. However, don&#39;t think you can order that breakfast burrito to go and take it into Matching Half cafe across the street or prepare to be snipped at-- but I digress.I&#39;m mostly writing this review on behalf of their Green Chile stew with chicken added in. It&#39;s bomb. Sometimes (just sometimes) I&#39;m trying to stay healthy and not chow down a million burritos a week and thus going to Mexican restaurants gives me anxiety. Thank goodness for this stew, it&#39;s light, filling, flavorful, vegetable-y, and good on my conscience. Highly recommending this under-appreciated player on the GCK menu.

Green chili stew is soooo good! Everything on the menu is super fresh made with high quality, organic food! I&#39;ve had brunch, lunch, dinner, take-out and catering for special events from the Green Chili Kitchen and Chili Pies and am always thrilled with the taste and quality! Thursday evenings at the bar in the Green Chili Kitchen are my favorite! I go there for the great food and excellent service from the bartender, Miche!

New Mexican cuisine. I liked it and plan to eat there again. I ordered the New Mexican layered chicken enchilada. The chicken was very flavorful not to mention the perfectly spicy sauce (just enough but not too spicy). My friend and I also shared nachos which were also good.Next time I will get the green chile stew (on a cold day) and the nachos to pick at. The partners of Green Chile Kitchen are good as well like Chile Pie down the street for desserts (i.e. Daddy&#39;s Cardamom ice cream!)

This place has quality food. Consistently. Great breakfast burritos and dinner menu.Service at the new location has been pretty bad. Seems like there are different people in there every time. Even when I call ahead and I arrive with my order ready on the counter I sometimes have to wait 10 minutes in line to get my food.Still the best food in the neighborhood.

The tortillas were seriously undercooked. They were borderline mushy.The pozole was fine. The sopaipillas were not as chewy as a remembered them in New Mexico, but my sample size is too small to make any conclusive recommendations.The tamales were also a bit &#34;mushy&#34; like the tortillas.As for service, it was decent enough. It seemed that they were intent on bringing the forks and spoons to the table, but they didnt bring the right qty and combination of utensils we needed, so I had to keep getting up to go find out where they hid them to get some.

Classic California casual style restaurant with amazing Mexican/Tex-Mex cuisine. We were there with a large group heard everyone raving about their dishes and I didn&#39;t loved everything I tasted. The roasted chiles with salt and lime are awesome although they vary in heat so be prepared. My first few were mild and I got a huge bite of an extremely hot one. Fortunately the nice selection of beer cooled my aching mouth. I had the chile relleno and it was just as good as the authentic Mexican food I&#39;m used too back at home (Southern California). Would highly recommend the green chile kitchen to anyone who loves good Mexican cooking!

This is a really good spot to bring vegetarian friends/family to. They have a large offering of tasty vegetarian dishes. No worries, meat-eaters (like myself) are welcome too. The 7-layer dip is delicious. It can be a meal on its own. The green chili soup is great as well with blue corn tortillas for dipping. I was told it&#39;s spicy, but it wasn&#39;t - at least not for someone who loves spicy food. The place has community seating so be prepared and open to sitting with strangers. It&#39;s definitely not your average corner taqueria - it&#39;s fancy Mexican food, if you will.

No one I know loves green chili like Sir Nicholas so when he found a place called Green Chile Kitchen on Yelp I knew it was just a matter of time until we tried it. And that time turned out to be about 4 days. This is a pretty casual place - you place your order at the counter, take a number, and have your food delivered to you. But, for being such a casual place they sure do have a nice organic wine list.I went with a taco plate for dinner - 3 tacos (your choose of beef, chicken, pork, or veggie), rice, and mixed vegetable. Because I heart variety I chose one of each type of taco except veggie. It was weird - all the tacos were good, but none of them had any sort of Mexican flavor that I know and love. And I don&#39;t love just one kind of Mexican flavor. I enjoy the stuff I eat in Denver, Arizona, southern California, heck I even wholeheartedly enjoy Tex-Mex. Actually, now that I think about it this was like Mex-Tex perhaps. Because they used corn tortillas and a nice salsa, but the meat itself was plainly flavored and there were fancy vegetables instead of refried beans. Anyway, the beef was my favorite as far as flavor went, but really it just tasted like a nice cut of beef on a corn tortilla.This place gets way crowded so I highly recommend going during off times and not with a big group. I probably wouldn&#39;t come back here on my own, but Nick enjoyed his green chili and being that he loves that stuff I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll find our way back here again sometime soon.

The food in this place is decent, but the style of ordering and self-seating is miserable. They serve &#34;upscale&#34; Mexican in relatively decent portions for the price, and the green chile is always delectable, but the way you order food and have to steal a table makes me never want to come back. Plus, the quality of food is similar to taquerias in the Mission, which won&#39;t gouge you in price and will generally have seating for you. Burritos, quesadillas, sopapillas, stews all made with plenty of seasoning, and the blue corn tortillas are a nice touch. Having to stake out tables and steal them from under people is such a horrible way to run a restaurant. And, don&#39;t pay the extra .75 cents for guacamole. You&#39;ll get about a tbsp of it. And, don&#39;t bring too many friends either. You&#39;ll be waiting forever to try to wrangle together some tables and seats.

Green chile makes a d*mn good burrito. I like that they lightly fry/toast the exterior of the burrito once it has been rolled, and the green sauce poured over top is delicious. This place has a nice atmosphere and plenty of places to sit (although weekends tend to get very crowded). Service is good and cashiers are always friendly. The horchata is pretty good too. Oh - and so is brunch.

This is classic New Mexican food. It&#39;s good for what it is - great guac (which is not New Mexican) and yummy tamales. I don&#39;t like chillies but that&#39;s what makes New Mexican food what it is. Husband said it was great. Ask for it Christmas, don&#39;t pick red or green, get both! Beans could use more flavor. Great margs!

Reading my friend&#39;s quick tip in the car ride over - long lines at 7pm, and we were driving over on a saturday at 7. Damn, we&#39;ll probably have to wait. Oh wait, we found parking right outside the restaurant? there&#39;s no line and plenty of tables? Oh well I guess we just have great luck. The boy actually saw some of his students there, kind of awkward, but it happens.I ordered the new mexican homestyle chicken enchilada that was delicious! The portions were a bit big, but damn, so delicious. The chicken was tender and it was smothered in this green sauce and definitely worth every bite.The boy ordered the tamales. he seemed to like them, but then again, we like our mexican food.the boy&#39;s dad ordered the carne adovada, spicy, but not overly so. Apparently not too authentic. Delicious though.The boy&#39;s mom ordered a 1/4? maybe a 1/2 chicken, looked pretty good.We also got the sopapillas. they&#39;re like fried bread that&#39;s kind of puffy. It&#39;s weird looking at first, but so delicious esp with their red chili honey.by the time we left around 830, the place was packed and definitely really hard to get seats, apparently just down the street they have a place to get pies or something. sounds interesting.

Although I live just a couple blocks from here, I rarely frequent this place. The food is enjoyable (that is, unless you get the spicy lime dressing on your salad, like I did, and find yourself burning off taste buds with each bite) but the prices are higher than I would expect for a laid-back neighborhood place. Plan on spending $10-12 for each entree. Granted, they are considered &#34;plates&#34; so your $11 burrito is actually a burrito &#34;plate&#34; with organic sides like rice and beans but still. Burritos really shouldn&#39;t be in the over-$10 range.I find myself just going down the street to Papalote to get my burrito fix. Well, until they jacked up their prices. The NERVE!Because I do find the food enjoyable on occasion, my go-to dishes are the southwestern steak salad (again, I&#39;d steer clear of the chipotle lime vinaigrette unless you&#39;re hoping for nightmares later on that evening) or the blue corn flat enchiladas. My husband swears by the tamales, which are delivered fresh weekly on Tuesdays, I think.As for the space...their old space was much nicer. This current location larger but also much louder. Not nearly as cozy.To satisfy that sweet tooth, head down the block to their old location where they&#39;ve opened up a pies and ice cream place. It&#39;s got mixed reviews but worth trying it out for yourself.

Hmm, came here for dinner and had the tamales and the fry bread. Both were just okay...I&#39;m not sure why all the great reviews. I&#39;m a bigger fan of papalote. Nothing tasted that extraordinarily delicious. Also beware seating - you order and seat yourself, so our group of 8 had to squeeze into a table for 4.

Oh Green Chile Kitchen....what to do with you.I was bored of everything around you so I gave you another chance. But you&#39;re still not worth going to and I think I&#39;m done forever.GCK has no niche and no gimmick other than to be expensive to eat at. While they plate their food much better than your standard taco dive; their rice, their beans, their meat, their tamales, their tortillas, etc. don&#39;t taste any better. Their sauces are a couple of steps below average.And there is just some lazy, shiftiness on the menu. One tamale is $4. Two tamales with a little lettuce and tomato thrown on the plate are $12. Fail.

A place that does well only by virtue of its location and price point (in an area that lacks decent casual dining options). I&#39;ve eaten here several times, and each time have left totally underwhelmed. But I know I&#39;ll return because it&#39;s a good spot in the nabe to meet up with friends for a meal when you don&#39;t want to eat pizza or wait forever for a table. The food is generally bland, inconsistent, oftentimes not warm enough, definitely not made to order, but edible/not terrible. My fave is the green chili soup and the salads are decent. The chicken is free range so + for that. Yesterday I found a hair in my lukewarm breakfast burrito, but didn&#39;t want another bland burrito so didn&#39;t bother to tell them.

Can&#39;t believe I&#39;ve never reviewed my regular saturday ritual.Everything I&#39;ve had here is awesome. The only thing bad about the gradually evolving menu is that I haven&#39;t had a burrito in a long time because I&#39;ve been busy trying everything else.I read a review in which someone said the food was bland. That ish cray! The stuffed breakfast sopaipillas are a texture sensation (crispy bacon, fluffy eggs, crunchy sopaipilla smothered in chile sauce.)My all-time fave is the green chile stew with chicken (it&#39;s the rotisserie chicken). Perfect on a cold night, best hangover/cold cure with kick.I also really like the burger, I read a yelp tip that the patty is frozen. If that&#39;s true, I think it is still a great burger.My least fave is the crispy tacos because of the premade shell, I think it represents green chile kitchen the least. Maybe that&#39;s geared toward the kiddies?You can get Racer 5 IPA on tap or an individual drip coffee.Conclusion: the existence of this place has enriched my belly&#39;s city life greatly!

Green Chile has a special place in my heart and memory. I used to love on the NOPA neighborhood and this was a stomping ground for me. I mean this place is magical. It&#39;s not only beautiful and modern, but their food is amazing, literally makes you question why you ate that frozen pizza for lunch and disgrace the holly than all else Green Chile burrito. Most of the times when making praise of all things beans and rice and of corse chile&#39;s at this establishment. There is a first bite silence that everyone else seems to partake in. Lets just say I only go back to that neighborhood to get my nails done and to have Green Chile burritos.Pros:Food- burritos and tacosThe beautiful restaurantBarCons:First come seatingCan get loudcome before 6 pm and there&#39;s a lot of families and kidsHard to parkAll in all the mission has amazing mexican food, but NOPA has the holly burrito at Green Chile Kitchen.

Just went here with one of my best friends. We were so excited to try something new. Having been out of the Bay Area for some time, I was looking forward to the great mexican food we have here. I found that the food was alright.I ordered the cheese tamale (with poblano pepper), a side of spanish rice and a glass of horchata. We also split a guacamole and chips starter.The best part of the meal was definitely the drink. Tamale was mediocre as it was somewhat dry. The Horchata was delicious and could have drank a few more. Guac was pretty good, lots of flavor and topped with fresh tomato and onions but the chips seemed almost too thick and not crunchy enough. Rice was also mediocre, not too much flavor going on there.All in all, i&#39;d maybe go again just for chips and guac and a drink. Then again, I&#39;ve been to many places in the mission and you just cant beat that food!

We walked in, grabbed a menu, ordered at the counter, and then waited with our little number thing until a table became available. It always feels a bit awkward - just standing there, waiting.After a short while, a table became free and we claimed it. I sat while my beloved got up to get us waters, napkins, and utensils.I got the blue corn flat enchilada- which was nice and filling. He had the green chile soup. All the food was nice, not too spicy, and satisfying but I couldn&#39;t see myself coming back and getting them again. I might be curious to try something else but I&#39;m not in any rush for it.

The interior of the place is nice and modern. I had the hard tacos. The ground beef had a good seasoning but they were taco shells. Tasted like a fancy Taco Bell hard shell taco. I expected more. The rice and beans were decent. The refried beans were mashed well but lacked flavor, as if they needed salt. Very bland. Also same goes for the rice. Made well, had the right texture but lacked flavor. Also it is pricey for New Mexican food. The horchata was terrible. The green chile was okay, it had too much juice like salsa and not enough actual green chile. I don&#39;t recommend this place unless your desperate.

Right down the street from me and the food is pretty great! I love the tamales, the burrito with steak is very good, and so were the nachos. I ordered the Chile Rellenos and is was decent, but I wish there was more flavor.Also, I&#39;m not one for Horchata because places always mess it up, but I enjoy it from here.It&#39;s pretty loud and there&#39;s always a fight for a table and people can be pretty rude about it. Like sitting in the seat where my purse is.

The food is nothing special. Had some overcooked carnitas that were recommended to me. Nice decor and 2$ beers is a plus, but you probably won&#39;t catch me back anytime soon. Oh, and getting charged a buck for a tortilla after I didn&#39;t like the sopapilla (sp?) didn&#39;t help their cause either. I&#39;ll stick with papalote and nopalito.

I outgrew Papalote as my favorite burrito place near my house and now make the longer trek to Green Chile Kitchen because it&#39;s worth it. My go-to solid meal is the super grilled steak burrito. That little bit of grilling plus your choice of chile just makes a difference to make this burrito a little more special than your average burrito. Also, I recommend the breakfast burrito which is basically your burrito fixings with eggs. Good thing I love eggs!I like that this place is off the main streets and is mostly surrounded by residencial housing. It makes it more local neighborhood-y. But, this place fills up during high demand hours (dinner time, weekend brunch) with a line going up to the door and children everywhere (Apparently, this is a family family friendly place). If you can, try to go in the off hours so you can get the same food experience without the crowds foggin&#39; up the joint.Oh yea, and their horchata is respectable and not a watered down mess like many others. Yay horchata!5 stars!!!!!!!!

My 600th review goes to one of the best breakfast burritos I&#39;ve had. Super soft and fluffy eggs, spicy chorizo, hot green chiles, salsa, and stewed potatoes round it all out on a toasted tortilla.Saturday morning, get thee a burrito.

I love this place and eat here almost once a week. It is great for kids, really casual and very friendly. The manager remembers us and always checks to make sure everything is okay and fixes anything that isn&#39;t. Parking is pretty easy (for SF) and while it is sometimes crowded, we&#39;ve never had to wait too long for a table. Take out is great as well.What to order:kale saladsalsa and/or guac appstaco saladhorchataMy kids love the burritos.

Green Chile Kitchen is fine if you want to have a cheapish brunch with some friends at a casual location. We came at 10:30am on a Sunday morning (before the rush!) with 4 other friends and put in our orders. This is where we start deducting stars.-2 stars for the serviceThe guy at the counter acted like he was a terrible mix of stoned and hungover. I repeated my very simple order (breakfast burrito, steak, mild sauce) to him many, many times and he still entered it wrong on the machine. Of the 6 of us who came, he got every single one of our orders wrong. Dude, your job is to listen to some people who are speaking pretty damn slowly and clearly. Just repeat it as you type it in. NOT HARD.Otherwise the food is just fine for your Americanized breakfast burrito. My burrito was loaded with soft scrambled eggs, chunks of potato and some steak. Covered in a nice mild green sauce. Nothing fancy or mind blowing. 2 of us paid $25 for 1 burrito with meat and the breakfast soft taco plate (2) with meat. Kinda expensive, but compared to normal brunch it was fine.

I&#39;ve always liked Green Chili Kitchen..but they definitely have upgraded when they moved to its new location.There is still a long line out the door..but no longer do people have to fight for tables. The new location is super spacious..lots more tables and even a long communal table.. great for large groups and baby strollers.Same great food and friendly service--I just wish they&#39;d do their breakfast burritos with eggwhites...maybe someday...

I really don&#39;t have any particularly good reason to update this place except for 1) I&#39;m pretty sure when I wrote my original review it was when they were at there old location (the new one is bigger and there is more seating), and 2) I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s just laziness on my part, but the last month or so I&#39;ve been eating here quite a bit again. It was only three blocks away from my house to begin with, and now it&#39;s only two...They still have the same great food as before &amp; the prices are reasonable (although I couldn&#39;t access a menu online the other day when I was ordering and I found a really old takeout menu in my house from here...this place used to be CHEAP!). I really haven&#39;t tried anything new, but the past few times I&#39;ve had out of town visitors we&#39;ve eaten here for hangover breakfast and the mango mimosa&#39;s are ridiculously good!

Great place for a casual breakfast or lunch experience. I found the breakfast offerings so-so, as it usually takes a lot to impress me. I had the breakfast burrito after reading several reviews here on Yelp, and found it a little more standard than I expected. That&#39;s not to say it wasn&#39;t worth the experience, just not a 5-star breakfast burrito in my opinion.However, their lunch menu is fantastic. Excellent burritos, quesadillas, and other Mexican fare, with a feel of homemade goodness. I recommend carne, the quarter chicken, and of course everything smothered in green chile.

Green Chile Kitchen is great!Went here the other night with a few friends for the first time. You order first then sit down. They have a nice selection, but the menu is not too overwhelming. I had the chicken tamales which had the perfect ratio of masa to meat. They also have a great house red wine for $5.The atmosphere is warm, fun and energetic, even on a Monday night.

I write with a little hesitation that next time I come in, someone is going to glare at me.Anywho, I&#39;ve tried Green Chile on numerous occasions, at all times of the day, for all meals, and the one thing I do like is their service.Food, however, consistently disappoints me. Burritos are maybe a 4 and cheese tamales are a 5, but everything else is a 3 at best in my book. The plates always look delicious but the flavors miss the mark and I often leave feeling that I could have made the same thing at home and been more satisfied. Breakfast I find particularly not appetizing, and the organic coffee they serve is really not good.So, if you&#39;re in the neighborhood and need a quick snack, get a few a la carte tamales. Those are great. Otherwise, eh.

A very unique take on New Mexican food! The chicken stew was worth ordering -- a bunch of warm homey goodness served in a bowl with a warm tortilla on the side. The blue corn enchiladas were also quite yummy. Definitely opt for the green chile sauce!Not much on the dessert menu, other than some mexican hot chocolate and flan. The had a special the night we went and offered sopapillas as well.The ambiance of the place is very warm and neighborhoody, and there was a constant flow of patrons at dinner time.

It&#39;s sort of embarrassing/hilarious how often I go to Green Chile Kitchen. Yes, it&#39;s 2 blocks from my house. Yes, it&#39;s inexpensive. And yes, I have an unhealthy obsession with breakfast burritos. But it&#39;s a great change of pace from typical &#34;Mexican&#34; food and almost everything on the menu has its own distinct take.When I&#39;m on the road for a few days, I crave their red sauce--it&#39;s this spicy/smoky combo salsa that I can&#39;t seem to find anyplace else.Plus, GCC is one of those uniquely SF eateries, where the staff mostly all look like they just came from a show at the Independent (or they&#39;re about to go). You sort of feel at home when you&#39;re there.Highly recommend for a casual dinner with friends or even a nice 2-person meal.

Holy habeanero salsa, that was HOT. Be careful...do not consume as regular salsa. So one star for the heat.And one star for leaving full and no stars for leaving unsatisfied. $10 burrito with all the fixings usually leads to awesome. Except at Green Chile, a chicken burrito is made with plain, boiled, seasonless chicken. Really. No seasoning. Why, god, why. I hope my burrito was only a lemon and I just took one for the team.

I&#39;m gonna start by saying that I&#39;m not a fan of order/sit down dining.... No one likes to stand, and I was ready to pass this eatery off as not worth reviewing, however... I had asked if there was a charger for my phone that I could use (semi-emergency) none available so I plugged in across the st. When I had stepped away, my plates were cleared!! Accidental, I hadn&#39;t said I was leaving but when I returned the staff was so apologetic and awesome they replaced my plate and when I enquired if I had to stand in line for another glass of wine, they offered one on the house.... A lil bumpy but then a great save! Thank you green chile staff, well played.

For those of us that are becoming a little TOO regular at Gordo&#39;s - Green Chile Kitchen offers some delicious fare at very reasonable prices and, best of all, it doesn&#39;t leave you feeling like you need to be wheeled home and plopped onto your couch for a 72 hour food coma.The hot sauce is delicious. The veggie burrito is absolutely killer. The staff is very, very friendly (friendliness always knocks a 4-star up to 5 for me). Also, their beer selection is pretty darn great.Cannot go wrong eating here. I&#39;d recommend it for anyone... anyone at all.

Really great location. The ambiance is really cool, indoor and outdoor seating. The decor is really nice. Not authentic Mexican flavors, by any means. The salsa&#39;s flavors were bland. The reason why I rate this place at three stars is because of the quality of food. This was my third time here and the two times before, I thought it was average and was hoping to try something that finally blew my mind, but that wasn&#39;t the case. I ordered the tamales and the amount of meat inside was minimal. My tamale was 90% corn and the other 10% meat. When I complained about it, the service worker was nice enough to give me another for free. Unfortunately, I experienced the same small amount of meat in that one. The food portion is not worth the price. Sadly, this place is so close to work that I would naturally enjoy frequenting it more, but will stay away.

I really wish this place was better because it&#39;s right out my front door and some good Mexican that&#39;s that convenient would be a dream come true. Even decent and cheap would be lovely. Not so much.I cannot understand for the life of me why this place is so popular. Great for kids and families, sure, but for people who actually like to TASTE their food? Come on.The three times I&#39;ve been here (yeah, REALLY wanted it to improve) I&#39;ve had one massively bland and overpriced experience after another. My girlfriend commented that her tacos tasted like Old El Paso out of the box and that despite the nostalgic kitsch value there was nothing else to enjoy.The vegetarian burrito, when cheese, guac and crema are added nears $10, is just so boring. No distinct flavors whatsoever. Just, bleh. If it even somewhat held a candle to Farolito, Pancho Villa or any one of the hundred other taquerias in town I might justify paying that price to walk there in my jammies but as it stands, nope. Sorry.Unless you&#39;re a tired parent who wants a night off from cooking and a glass of wine skip this place and wave down a taco truck. I guarantee it&#39;s better. And cheaper.

I love Green Chile Kitchen. being a New Mexico expat, it is the only place around to get a regular infusion of my favorite New Mexican foods. Green chile stew, pozole, carne adovada, calabacitas - give to me! love it. I&#39;ve been eating there since it first opened. It is a friendly and welcoming place with the proper rustic, found art sort of Santa Fe ethos to it.An added bonus: they sell frozen New Mexico green chile in 5 lb. blocks that you can take home and make yourself. It seems to be the only place in the area where you can find the stuff.

I&#39;d describe this place as having simple, rustic Mexican dishes with decent flavors. More of a 3.5 star kind of place based on the prices for a order-at-the-counter place.I ordered 3 tacos (one pork, steak, chicken) with a side of grilled veggies, and my guy had the quarter chicken with a side of black beans and salad. Again, nothing fancy, but simple, tasty and fresh, although I could have used a bit more kick with both dishes. Also wish they weren&#39;t out of Sangria, maybe next time...with a burrito that looked really good when it came out. Service was great (we ordered, they brought it out quickly and hot, simple concept.)Between here an Napolito, I&#39;d probably choose Napolito, but I&#39;d give GCK another chance, perhaps with a big group of friends to split of bunch of dishes and some pitchers of Modelo.

been wanting to try this place for a while, finally got around to it.convinced the gf to do the wiggle on the tandem bike to go out to dinner on a saturday night.crowded, as expected, I mean, it was saturday night.seating was tight, but we managed a spot at one of the communal tables. fine with me.ordering was straight up, counter style, then they give you a number &amp; bring your food when ready.I got the bowl of green chili stew, with 2 sopaipillas.it was pretty good, not exactly like NM, but pretty close. straight up hatch chili, which was fine. the sopaipillas were very good, pretty much my main reason for going here.gf had the veggie quesadilla, she said it was bland. It had some zucchini in there. The side of hot sauce it came with was pretty good, and made the thing much better.2 beers on top of that and it came to $27, which was reasonable.too many kids running around, but that is probably why they go there.not quite a 4 star joint, but what gives them the extra star was the guy taking my order was so super nice, and seemed really happy that I liked the sopaipillas.we&#39;ll go there again to try the frito pie and some dessert.tip: draft beer is $5 but bottle beer is $2

The vegetarian red chili tofu burrito was delicious as well with its red sauce blanket. I&#39;m also craving the homey atmosphere. When they say kitchen, it means it looks like a bigger version of someone&#39;s New Mexico kitchen/ dining room area. Just lovely. Went for chili icecream around the corner for desert!

- Pay the extra $1 for steak. Tender and full of flavor.- The namesake green chile is good with a solid amount heat - I prefer it to the red, which is kind of bland- The blue corn tortillas are great, especially in the enchiladas- The tamales are so-so. They masa is a little bland for my liking, but the filling is good.

Ugh, I can&#39;t believe there is still so much confusion out there. Green Chile is NOT a Mexican restaurant. And when some say &#34;New Mexican&#34; it doesn&#39;t mean a new type of Mexican food with a modern update. NO people. When they say &#34;New Mexican&#34; they mean from New Mexico, in the Southwest. It even says it on the restaurant&#39;s sign. Capish?The breakfast burritos at Green Chile are THE BEST EVER!!! Huge, stuffed to the brim with delicious chile goodness. My mouth waters at the thought. You can also get a veggie version with Soyriso instead of chorizo.The rotisserie chicken is absolutely scrumptious! I love getting the 1/2 chicken dinner plate and saving the leftovers for the next day. You can also just buy whole rotisserie chickens to go. It&#39;s helpful to call and place your order ahead of time. This is a life saver during busy hours like Friday night.I highly recommend the Posole soup. It&#39;s the best thing for a hangover or when you&#39;re just feeling tired, under the weather or in need of comfort. It&#39;s spicy, flavorful and loaded with juicy chunks of rotisserie chicken and hominy. A squeeze of lime juice and chopped cilantro on top and you have perfection.Just like in New Mexico, they give you the choice of adding red or green chile to your meal. Chile is a big deal in New Mexico, and Green Chile&#39;s signature chiles do not disappoint. You can even order &#34;Chirstmas&#34; and have both chiles added to your meal.Another thing I love about Green Chile is that they offer green tea Kombucha on tap. Theirs is refreshing and delicious, much better than getting it from a bottle.The restaurant is spacious and family friendly but it can get quite busy on weekends. Lots of families come, so if you&#39;re not in the mood for screaming children, try to go at night.

I found this place while biking around SF. A few friends made the trip up for an event at Golden Gate park, and ended up following a couple as they were leaving on their bikes. They were fast! When we finally caught a light, I asked them where to eat, and they directed me to Green Chile Kitchen.I ordered the Super Steak Burrito (They have a fancier name for it) and I thought it tasted great! We also got some of their specialty pie (don&#39;t remember what it was called, sorry!) and it was divine.All in all, a great place, I&#39;d definitely go there again. If the random cycling couple sees this, Thanks! You guys were a blast to follow through the park! Awesome quick pace!

As a New Mexican, I wouldn&#39;t exactly call it New Mexican food, and neither do the owners/chefs at Green Chile Kitchen. New Mexican *Inspired* is certainly the right phrase for it. Either that or &#39;gentrified.&#39;I&#39;ve eaten here twice, and neither time have I felt like I was eating at Sadie&#39;s or Los Cuates; I really felt like I was eating at Flying Star (Albuquerque-ans, you know what I&#39;m talking about.) For those of you who don&#39;t get the reference, Flying Star is a spot for hipsters to hangout and get organic food of all sorts, and it all tastes lackluster and overpriced. Yes, it tastes overpriced.The food just misses the spot. Maybe it&#39;s because none of it is smothered in a pool of Red Chile, or maybe they&#39;ve just been using a mediocre batch of green chili when I&#39;ve been in the restaurant; or maybe I&#39;m expecting too much as a recent transplant from New Mexico, but it&#39;s just not New Mexican.Good try though, I&#39;ll give you a 4 for effort.

I just moved to the area and went here for the first time last week. It was really cute and not at all what I expected! It&#39;s usually really crowded when I go by, so I thought it was just a sit-down place, but really you can just grab and go takeout super easily. The service was fast and everyone working there was really nice. The food was also really good! Got the grilled burrito and in comparison to the other burrito on the menu, it was a couple bucks cheaper and probably just as much food. Sooo good. Tasted much healthier than most burritos which I was pleased with. So yummy, glad I live nearby because I&#39;ll be coming back!

I&#39;ve been on the hunt for a chill mexican food spot in my hood in SF and I think this just might be it! Walk in (generally wait in line for a minutes, but spend your time looking over the menus, good and drink, and making a choice meal selection), order your food and drink, take your number and hunt down a spot to eat. Nice and easy.Now, in regards to the food- mine was great. I had the stuffed burrito and it was evenly filled with chicken, cheese and beans, covered in chili and served with sides. So good!The atmosphere is chill, the music was a bit wack but whatever. I will be going back to this spot again, for sure!

I&#39;ve never seen her in a good mood, she almost never smiles, and always looks like she just shouldn&#39;t be bothered. I&#39;ve actually AVOIDED going into Green Chile because I just don&#39;t feel like dealing with her cranky ass. Fairly sure she&#39;s probably the one who gets my orders wrong too.That being said, everyone else who&#39;s helped me out there has been wonderful. Ariel (I think that&#39;s her name?) is especially a sweetheart. It&#39;s too bad I encounter this other woman 90% of my visits. Let her go, already! She&#39;s bad for business.Anyway, about the food. The food is good ya&#39;ll. Nothing to call home about, but it is consistently tasty and fills me up. I tend to order a naked burrito of some sort or a couple of tamales if I&#39;m not super hungry. The best thing to get here, though, are the breakfast burritos. Bacon, potatoes, eggs, cheese, and salsa. You can&#39;t go wrong. And the first bite you take into that releases that molten lava cheesy goodness... hot damn! Never hesitate to go in for one of their breakfast burritos. Cranky McCashier never seems to be around for breakfast/brunch either, which is a definite plus.All in all, not too bad. Does the job and is conveniently in my hood.

My wife and I had dinner tonight at Green Chile Kitchen. It was our 2nd time to the Restuarant and we love it. I had the blue masa tamale plate and it was awesome. My wife had the crispy taco plate and she was thoroughly happy with her meal. I am a native New Mexican and the food at the Green Chile Kitchen is the next best thing to a trip home and enjoying that &#34;back home green chile&#34;. Thanks for a great meal at a great price. We&#39;ll be back soon.

GCK hits it out of the park on almost everything. Note that if you&#39;re looking for a leisurely meal, valet parking, fine wine or a huge menu selection, GCK isn&#39;t it. But if you&#39;re looking for the best taqueria food, mod and clean surroundings not the usual tac-dinge, a &#34;hit the spot&#34; beer and a place to refuel kids without them driving you nuts and/or embarrassing you, this is the place. I wish they had carnitas but the beef and chicken are fab. My fave is the carne adovada which is often listed as a special but then they pointed out was actually on the regular menu.Definitely the place for a burrito and a pie for desert.

This is one of my favorite spots in SF. I usually get a burrito, but nothing I or my dining companions have tried has been bad. And best of all, their menu features Mary&#39;s Free Range chicken &amp; Niman Ranch meat!

Absolutely fantastic breakfast burritto. Chorizo is a bit on the salty side. Some of the best blue corn tortillas I&#39;ve ever had. Decor reminds me of growing up in the southwest desert with lots of cocapelli (sp?) and hopie Indian influences making it truly distinct New Mexican feel. Coffee is so-so but everything was as good as can be expected.

Have been a neighborhood fan of this place since they opened but went yesterday and am convinced they&#39;ve reduced their portion size...Same price for a burrito...smaller burrito. They&#39;re already on the pricey side so this will definitely make me think twice before going back.Has anyone else noticed this?

The pozole and most of their stews are excellent. However, most of the other stuff has been pretty average. The burritos are more tortilla than anything else. Although I get the feeling that all their ingredients are ultra-fresh, most of the food comes out tasting almost a little too homemade. If I think I could produce what came out on the plate at home, I&#39;m not sure I should be paying to eat it. The menu is quite large, so maybe I just haven&#39;t hit on the right things yet.The service is above average, and they have 2 beers for $2 specials. Can&#39;t beat that. The seating is kind of a lurking grab whatever opens up system, so if you come when it&#39;s crowded (which is pretty often), you might end up squeezing in with some other people. This can be a good thing at the big communal table. The tables do seem to turnover pretty quickly, though.

//This review is about Green Chile Pies//I wish I would have read the other reviews before coming here. Upon hearing about the vegetarian pot pie and veggie chile Frito pie, I was so excited! Then I ate the pot pie and it was like eating old people food. So bland, so boring. I wanted to love it, I tried to trick myself into loving it, but it was useless. The Frito pie was okay, and we actually tried the apple pie and that was fine but I left feeling very unsatisfied.Also, the wine and beer selection were awful.

Recipe for a culinary fiesta in your mouth...get up early on a Saturday (I know, I know...) run 8 miles and climb 1,700 feet on the trails of the Marin Headlands, go straight to Green Chili Kitchen, brave the madness of the line and order the eggs w/enchiladas + a Blue Star beer on tap. Done. That&#39;s all I&#39;ve got for you...bliss.tip: if you&#39;re &#34;two&#34; and encumbered by a car, drop one to order and secure a table while the other searches for parking.

I am a fan of the ambience and the service here. The food is always delicious. The carne adovada is addictive and their salads are actually real meals.The one thing I have a hard time getting over is how pricey it is. Every meal is a few more dollars then what you&#39;d expect to pay at any other decent Mexican place.

If you are expecting Mexican cuisine, you came to the wrong place.This is New Mexican and it should have a category all it&#39;s own!I came here the other day, after seeing this inChronicle&#39;s Bargain Bites.Their green chili is awesome! I like it mild, but my dining companion likes his hot and loved his too. We shared a cup of Pozole, and it was wonderful. I would come back just for this, but the rest of the meal was equally good.Beef taco, green chicken enchilada served with rice and beans. Really hit the spot. I would go back if I was in the neighborhood. Parking was pretty easy during an early lunch hour.

Went for dinner this past friday night with the Bf and had a nice time. Exquisite is the resident crazy hobo outside in a red shiny shortie jacket loudly cursing at the straw statue behind the cashier. Very angry and very schizophrenic. Mission charm, I suppose.Some say that authentic Mexican food is just about taste and not fancy schmancy presentation. I violently disagree. I was about to keel over and chew on the wooden tables after being stuck in rush hour bay bridge traffic, and I still remember that my plate looked like the vomirrhea of the homeless people outside the heavy wooden doors of this establishment. The 4 corners of my square plate each featured a nice heap of lumpy brown-dark-greenish mash, and at the center was my entree, looking equally depressing. Wop-wop.This place lost a star for the disgusting soggy mess they tried to sell me as Chile Rellenos. There&#39;s something wrong with enjoying everything on my chile relleno combo plate more than the headlining chile rellenos. And the sides were quite excellent - they had this red finely diced salsa that really hit the spot and was very zesty and the potatoes and beans all outshined the star player. Still not great for the price - I&#39;ve come to expect good Mexican food in SF at wholesale prices, so $16 for this fugly food seemed unfair.But Bf had the signature green chile pork burrito and was a huge fan, so maybe I just ordered wrong.But I actually do plan to return to try out the intriguing dessert menu, so maybe I&#39;ll add that star back. And instead take it away for the mythological parking opportunities in this neighborhood.Ambiance: low key but not comfy. Urban picnic setup and felt kind of cafeteria-style. Chairs are hard and plastic and bare-minimum, and condiments and water and utensils are self-serve. Not a huge fan of having to seat ourselves and awkwardly stand around until tables cleared up. Staff is very friendly tho.

Summary: Decent, not-too-expensive mains. Killer apple pie. Chill atmosphere.Came here with a friend on a Mon. night around 8 PM - had some people in there but wasn&#39;t crowded. Decor was nice - laid back, chill, communal and individual tables.Meals cost us about $12 each (1/2 chicken and sides, enchilada and sides). Food was solid. Nothing spectacular, but not bad.The apple pie though was killer. Cheddar cheese crust, jalapenos, apple filling. Definitely worth the trip within itself.Would come back again for the apple pie, probably not for anything else.

This place is so good!!I don&#39;t even feel like it&#39;s an actual mexican restaurant because it feels like some kind of chic bistro with good mexican.I&#39;ve been here a few times with friends because it&#39;s close to campus and both times I got their Chicken Tamales. They were the best I&#39;ve had outside of my grandmothers homemade tamales on christmas. I wanted a side of ranch, but oddly they don&#39;t carry ranch dressing. Maybe I&#39;m the only freak who likes my chicken tamales dipped in ranch....but the girl working brought me an alternative buttermilk dressing which was even more amazing than ranch.

Went here last night because my date said it was one of his favorite restaurants in the city. And guess what? My date had good taste...the food was amazing! I had some chicken tacos with squash on the side. Light, flavorful and spicy. I finally gave in and tried soju because I really wanted a margarita. The margarita tasted good so I wasn&#39;t going to complain about the low liquor content in the drink. My date got the veggie stew and some enchiladas. Loved it. Also, the setting is great, not just the food. Hardwood floors, solid wooden tables, candles (or fake candles) in little paper bags as if we&#39;re in Santa Fe instead of San Francisco. Great, unpretentious setting and good food, what&#39;s not to love?

Fresh and good,I&#39;ve never really had authentic southwestern food before, but I was told this was the place to go. I really liked the blue corn flat enchilada, nice and cheesy. The atmosphere is nice too, laid back but you feel like you&#39;re eating in a church pew. One of the best sit down Latin restaurants in the city, in my opinion.

In the aftermath of Hardly Strictly Bluegrass, my small group of 3 hit up Green Chile Kitchen this past Sunday night. Our first choices, Little Chihuahua, Nopalito and Ragazza had enormous wait lists, so we thought GCK would be a good option for some fast mexican. Boy were we wrong.Let me first say that the food at GCK has never been stellar. Their burritos are the best things on the menu. I&#39;ve tried their soft tacos (gross), salads (yawn) and enchiladas (meh). Each time, I think I&#39;ll find some hidden gem but I have yet to be impressed. This time, I went for the veggie burrito and a cup of green chile stew. My bf got the nachos and my friend, a smothered burrito plate.The service and wait killed me. We waited 40 minutes from placing our order until it was ready. Let me say that again, 40 minutes. I could have gone to New Mexico and made my own green chile stew. We watched our nachos get fried under the broiler when the cook forgot them and then watched him get huffy when we asked for new ones. When we mentioned our wait time to the girl working the register we got a thanks for waiting and we&#39;re doing the best we can. My friend asked for a bag of chips as a courtesy and we were told that she could lose her job if she were to give away free chips. Really? Rude.Overall the food at GCK is not worth the bad service and wait. Definitely avoid this place after any event in GGP and beware the salty staff. The kitchen is anything but efficient. Was there a silver lining to the whole evening (besides Sharon Jones and time with my sugs)? Indeed there was, I finally had something really tasty here: the green chile stew. Delicious!

I am so thankful that I decided one day to get off the 5 bus and try the food at this charming and cozy cocina. This place is truly something special and may just be my new favorite place to eat in the city.When I tried the food, I did not know that is was considered &#34;New Mexican&#34; cuisine. I just figured it was savory and flavorful beyond my years of eating mexican food my whole life. The quality and richness of the food is easily detectable within every bite; it&#39;s sets a new standard of what organic and natural should taste like in any food.I also love the fact that they serve Pozole; I do not know of that many places that have it or offer is EVERYDAY like GCK does. A cup of that with ONE soft taco and my stomach was full. This is coming from a self-proclaimed Miss-Eats-Alot.Yes the portions are small in comparison with price, but I am willing to throw down money for this place. They have a variety of food options and items to choose from, and I am going to do the best I can to bring friends with me the next time I go to this place to share the love and try new things. Although I do not know how friendly the staff is here, at least they all seem happy to work here. For the best dine-in experience, do try to go anytime before the sun goes down.

I&#39;ve been here twice. The food is good, make no mistake. If you go here, you will probably not leave here feeling ill, or in any way disappointed with the overall quality of the food. This is a New Mexican restaurant. In a very big way, red and green chile sauces are the focal point of New Mexican cuisine. It is what sets it apart from other regional variations (Tex-Mex, etc.). The chile sauces here are NOT included with your meal. It&#39;s like ordering spaghetti and meatballs, but you have to pay extra for the marinara or bolognaise. It&#39;s absurd. Without the chile sauce, it&#39;s just Mexican food; and with that being the case, you might as well just go to a tacqueria in the Mission where you won&#39;t be paying 8 bucks for a quesadilla.Good food. Overpriced. Does not include the essential components of New Mexican food.

I think I liked the Green Chile in its &#34;before&#34; state versus the one now, but it&#39;s still good. I&#39;ve been here a couple times, most recently this weekend for some blue corn crispy chicken tacos and rice and beans. The tacos were a little bland, and I found a few bones in my chicken. I guess that accounts for the freshness? The rice was a little mushy, but the beans tasted pretty good. The chips and 4 salsas appetizer? Yum. The green chile salsa was the best. Go figure.I&#39;m never blown away by the Green Chile, but it&#39;ll hit the spot when I&#39;m in the neighborhood.Oh, and their margaritas are made with Soju because they don&#39;t have a license to make them with tequila!

May be I messed up by not coming here for the yelp-raved breakfast burritos, but from what I tasted of the non-breakfast items, I am not too sure I&#39;m so convinced of the wothiness of Green Chile&#39;s hype.I ordered the chicken stew, which was hearty, and made with fresh top quality ingredients, but the taste is far from perfection. The carnitas is nowhere near the &#34;melt in your mouth&#34; goodness that I was used to with tex-mex. The pork was chunky, tendony, and um... hearty... not what I was expecting and all around just not right. It wasn&#39;t very well seasoned either, as with the Carne Asada.This place doesn&#39;t hold a candle to the Little Chihuahua. May be I would give it another try at breakfast.... or not.

Delicious food and a great ambiance that keeps drawing me back for more.There are plenty of veggie options to choose from. On my last visit I tried out the Savory Stuffed Sopapillas - christmas style. The portion size was good, the salsas tasty and complimented each other nicely. My dinner-date enjoyed the enchiladas.They had a christmas stout -float on special, I wasn&#39;t a fan. Next time I&#39;ll stick to jalapeno-lemonade, which is a real treat.

This is one of my two favorite burritos places in SF!!! The thing I appreciate most about this place is how fresh the food is - more than I can say for most places in the Mission. Don&#39;t get me wrong, my other favorite burrito place IS in the Mission, but I still really appreciate GCK&#39;s healthy options and imported New Mexican green chile, a unique addition to my burritos.Favorite menu items: veggie burrito, breakfast burrito, green chile stew, nachos, blue corn enchiladas, sangriaThe only negative thing I do have to point out is that this place has become insanely popular (busy) recently and seems to be outgrowing the current restaurant space between too few tables and too small a kitchen. There can be quite a wait for your food at rush hour. That being said, once you get your food, the wait was MOST DEFINITELY worth it.

This place was a few blocks from my friend&#39;s place, so we decided to check it out. This was the first New Mexican food restaurant I came across other than the ones actually in New Mexico, and I was quite happy to find one since I love New Mexican food.I ordered a New Mexican Homestyle Chicken Enchilada Plate with Christmas Sauce (Green and Red Chile), and it was pretty darn good! It came with some lettuce, beans, and rice. The chicken was cooked perfectly too very very moist. I think the portions are a bit on the smaller side, but hey, for a person that can&#39;t eat American sized portions, this was perfect! I also really liked the sour cream for some reason. It was very rich and creamy, and kind of tasted like cream cheese.We came on a super sunny day in the city, and the restaurant had all their windows open. It was nice to feel the sun light in the restaurant while enjoying a delicious meal.Definitely coming back again.

NOT A GOOD REPRESENTATION OF NEW MEXICAN FOOD (except for the stew).I&#39;m going to come back here for the breakfast burrito that changed Dan L.&#39;s life. They stop serving breakfast at 10 AM and they don&#39;t serve the burger until after 5PM, so it was kind of frustrating.We tried the beef steak burrito with green chile sauce, as well as the green chili pork stew.To be honest, the burrito was just whatever. The green chili salsa dip was delicious and the stew would make me come back for it. SO, if you are going there, try the stew.The atmosphere of the restaurant was fun and it was nice decorated with pretty affordable prices.

Having relatives in Santa Fe/Albuquerque and visiting for any extended amount of time makes me really miss SF Mexican food. But, living in SF I find myself missing real Southwestern food on occasion, so this place takes care of me. Avoid going in a group at peak hours, it&#39;s seat-yourself/order at the counter so it can be tough sometimes.

I must have dane brammage. For whatever reason, I block out about how irritating it is to order food to-go from Green Chile Kitchen, yet I keep ordering from here forgetting that it takes 40-50 minutes (after calling in) to get the food. I have to give myself credit, I thought that after Green Chile moved to a bigger place on Fulton, they would change their system and be able to get at least one of our orders right (nope!) or at least have it ready 30 minutes after we call it in. We&#39;ve tried this experiment at different times of the evening and it doesn&#39;t seem to make a difference.The odd thing is we order the rotisserie chicken meal which is already prepared. I know this because I have watched them (after waiting at the counter) eventually plop my food from the heating trays into the to-go boxes. It isn&#39;t as if they had to actually cook anything while I waited, it is just a matter of throwing a precooked chicken into a box and then ladling beans, rice, squash into containers. And if I&#39;m lucky, occasionally wrapping up a tortilla and throwing a package of salsa into a bag. Why does this take almost an hour to do when there are only 5 customers in your restaurant?Tonight, not only was our order f*cked up (no tortilla or salsa) but it took 40 minutes (from the time we called in) to receive our order. Apparently, there still isn&#39;t a way for the staff to check the orders before sending it out but they do profusely apologize each time I have to go back. From now on, we&#39;re eating at Delessio and Nopalito, which is about the same price but with much better ingredients. Or maybe I don&#39;t understand the Slow Food Movement but whatever it is, Green Chile Kitchen is giving it a bad name.Eat before ordering, this includes dining in (which is much worse).

If you like REAL green chile New Mexican food, then there really is no other option for you in the bay area. This place hits the spot, so much so I&#39;m barely looking forward to the food on my trip to NM in two weeks :)Large parties should send a few people ahead to reserve a big table. I appreciate the efficiency of their cafe style of service.And of course the unique touch of the water jars instead of glasses with straws adds something new and fun.

Overall I can&#39;t say I was very thrilled with this restaurant. I guess I enjoy more authentic mexican food.I order the 3 taco plate with pork. Tacos were alright. I didn&#39;t care much for the rice. It tasted bland and just not what i am used to. I wish instead of the veggie mix it came with beans.Husband got nachos and a steak taco. I have to say the steak in the taco was extremely yummy. Hubby said nachos were alright.The place is tiny and it was extremely crowded the day we came. Luckily we scored seats next to their large window.I did like that they had a place to serve your own water. I find it cool when places use mason jars for their cups.It was a decent experience to try someplace new but I don&#39;t think I am going to go out of my way to come back.

Green Chile is one of the most inconsistent restaurants around and I am appalled by their customer service. Two weeks ago I had a delicious vegetarian burrito bowl and was excited to come back again for the same thing. After I ordered, I was brought the wrong dish so I sent it back. Not that big of a deal - mistakes happen. After waiting 15 minutes for the right order, they finally brought me a bowl with a pile of black beans, a pile of rice, and dry tofu with no seasoning or sauce/salsa whatsoever. The same thing happened another time I went here where they brought me the wrong dish, I sent it back, and then they brought me the wrong dish AGAIN. At this point I was frustrated, since I have gotten this dish many times and know this is not what it looks like. I went up front and asked the chef to add the sauce that usually comes on it. He looked dumbfounded and plopped some pico de gallo on the uncooked tofu so I would go away... Then I asked to speak with the main chef. I explained the situation - that I&#39;m a regular customer and this is not what the dish normally looks like. He seemed confused as well but said he would bring me something better. (Keep in mind the person I was eating with was completely done eating at this point). Finally he brought out a bowl with overcooked tofu and an orange (?) sauce. I&#39;m a regular customer and go there for a specific dish, so when I inconsistently get the dish I actually ordered, it&#39;s frustrating and I&#39;ll probably stop going here. I would normally give Green Chile 4 stars but after this happening multiple times + the terrible customer service, I have to give it 1 star.

All I wanted on this particular morning was a breakfast taco. I also didn&#39;t feel like trekking to the Mission.I tried to order 2 b.tacos with flour tortillas, which I didn&#39;t think would be impossible b/c they had flour tortillas on the menu. Apparently they cannot stray from how they serve breakfast tacos... 2 miniature corn tortillas laid out like a Venn Diagram with potatoes, eggs and cheese piled on top. How the heck was I supposed to eat this? It wasn&#39;t easy - that is for sure. I managed, but only b/c I wanted it so bad.The place had a cool vibe and I am most interested in going back for lunch/dinner or maybe even a breakfast burrito, but not for the over priced, poorly served breakfast tacos.

I&#39;ll admit - I&#39;m not the best critic when it comes to Mexican food.But, I will always rave about their burrito bowls!!Tender carne asada, fresh salsa... even down to the plating and the cute mason jars as water cups - they do know how to appeal to my classy taste!The only gripe is parking, but that&#39;s already a given!So please do yourself a favor and give this restaurant a try. I&#39;m incredibly sad that I haven&#39;t been in months.

I was introduced to this fabulous spot by a fellow USF grad student while suffering through an all day Saturday class. We had about an hour to grab lunch, and she recommended Green Chile Kitchen.I can&#39;t believe I&#39;ve spent so much time in this area and I didn&#39;t know about this place! The food is amazing! The place is packed on the weekends, so be sure to allow enough time to get your order in and eat (indigestion and a 7 hour Saturday class do not make for pleasant times!)I&#39;m a fan of their enchiladas, burritos and tamales. Can&#39;t say I&#39;ve tried anything here that I haven&#39;t thoroughly enjoyed!

The stew. Oh dear Jesus, the stew.I was feeling pretty under the weather last week but somehow mustered up the energy to meet up with a friend I hadn&#39;t seen in a few weeks for dinner. We got to Green Chile Kitchen and I was immediately grateful that I didn&#39;t have to sit at a table and wait for a waiter and all that non-sense.Walked up, ordered, waited a short hot minute(s), and ate delicious green chile chicken stew that was exactly what I needed on a cold evening to soothe my violent sniffling.I felt pretty rejuvenated after the steaming pile of Mexican Goodness warmed my insides; essentially TheraFlu with hot peppers. Delicious.

What?!-- you&#39;re out of your home-made blue corn tortillas?! How COULD YOU?!It&#39;s okay, I still love you.I got the healthy breakfast bowl and felt super, super satisfied. Eggs were fluffy and not overcooked, served with a giant bed of toppings. They are generous with their food here, and the food itself has a very satisfying array of flavor and color, which is often difficult to achieve when working with vegetarian and organic ingredients.

Truth: Not a huge fan of their standard New Mexican Fare here, but, my God do I love their roasted chicken and refried beans. For a mere $21.70 (tax included) you can get a veritable feast for at least 4 people with the entire chicken along with a veggie side, beans, rice, tortillas and all the sauces you&#39;ll need and is probably the best deal you can find on this side of the panhandle. Also...those beans just make me want to OM NOM them so badly, like all the damn time.

3.5 stars, for nowI&#39;ve only recently been here once, and will probably update my review and up my rating if this place appeals to me again, but as of now I don&#39;t know enough about the rest of the dishes to give it a whopping 4+ stars.Per the hundreds of other yelp comments, I tried the breakfast burrito with chorizo with both red and green chile sauces (&#34;christmas&#34; for an extra $1). You can also add sour cream, guacamole and cheese for $1.50. The red sauce was tasty, but the green sauce blew me away! What I love about these types of sauces is that it doesn&#39;t have that one-dimensional &#34;spicy&#34; spice that stings your taste buds and hits you all at once, but is more of an underlying and slowly-developing heat that adds another layer of flavor to the dish. The burrito wasn&#39;t drowning in sauce, which it should NOT be!All-in-all great, close, and reasonably priced. I can&#39;t wait to go back and try their stew!

I would really give this place 3.5 stars, but Yelp still disallows half stars sadly. The food was pretty well done, I had a quarter chicken and a kale salad for dinner. The salad could have been presented a bit better, the flavors were good but everything looked a bit mushy. The chicken was good as well, nothing stood out about it but it had good flavor and wasnt overly cooked

If I keep giving out 5 stars people are going to think I&#39;m getting paid off.But this is worth it. Man oh man is this worth it.The restaurant (if you could call it that) that I had most loathed in my time living in this great city was Cafe Neon. I never thought I would be having such an incredible time in the building, which I had highlighted in my review of Neon as one of the lowest points, being cavernous and kind of formal feeling.But Green Chile has done it. They really have.The atmosphere is well done. Whereas before the tile floor seemed kind of surgical and cold, the restaurant is filled with warm South of the Border feeling red tones, old dry wooden decor minimally spaced for style across the walls. The columns, bar and tables are thick and strong looking wood.We ordered the plato de apertivos, a green chile stew, a Niman Ranch steak Burrito and a Roasted Chicken Burrito. Everything was above average. The salsas were flavorful and out of the ordinary. Our tamales were equally good. The guacamole was chunky and tasted freshly prepared. The burritos were of high quality; we could taste the quality of the meat and the care of preparation.They have beer on draught as well for an added bonus. There is something also to be said for the value. This is upscale Mexican cuisine. I ordered the largest appetizer plate, 2 entrees and 2 beers and it came out to a ridiculously affordable 35 dollars.I can affirm that I will be going back, again and again.

It was good. But it ain&#39;t the cheapest. The place is tucked away in an obscure spot, but that&#39;s cool. It&#39;s not far from Lower Haight. The ambiance is cool. Order at the counter, which is nice.I had the green chili chicken soup and it was legit. Very spiced, very good. Served with some fresh hot tortillas. And the pork green chili quesadilla. It was pretty good, but not cheesy enough. I think it was actually pretty safe, maybe not as flavorful as I like.All in all a great place, but not for the price. Still, I&#39;m a fan.

I would say that my one star review is a little out of the norm for the service at Green Chili Kitchen. I mean, any other time I&#39;ve been there, the food has been good (except for their tamales). I&#39;ve been going there for years, beginning with their little location on Fulton (now their ice cream place).Aaaaanyway, the other day I went there and ordered a chicken salad, and the chicken was bad. I mean, when I put it up to my mouth, I could smell that it was bad. Now, I could maybe guess that the cook didn&#39;t take the time to smell it, but when I sent it back, they were less than apologetic. In the end, I just got my money back and left. Sad, too, because they used to have much better quality in the old location.I&#39;m thinking that the next time I think of Green Chili Kitchen, I&#39;ll probably just head to Papalote or The Little Chihuahua.

I think every neighborhood needs a place serving great breakfast burritos. In NOPA, Green Chile Kitchen is that place. The ingredients are local and organic and they taste great. GCK prides itself on its New Mexican chiles and they are delicious. The healthy breakfast bowl with a side of blue corn tortillas are also really good.For dinner, they have a lot of good choices and I&#39;ve never been disappointed by anything I&#39;ve ordered. They have a daily $2 Pacifico special which is hard to beat. There is a good amount of seating including a bar which is convenient if you&#39;re going to eat there.

Full disclosure: this place used to be right down the street from me. Since it moved, it is now right on my corner. This is both a blessing and a curse.Now I give it five stars as a vegetarian. In that context, all the meals are reasonably priced for their portions. However, for you meat eaters out there, it is a bit more pricey, hence the $$.My favorite here are the burritos. Vegetarian, no sour cream, green hot, smothered in cheese. I would have it every meal if I had the money. But many of the other menu items are just as good. Only once in my long history of frequenting this place have they messed up my order and it was pinto beans instead of black beans, so it was still enjoyable.Green Chile does a good job creating an atmosphere. The chili peppers hanging everywhere, the religious paraphernalia, the jars for glasses, and lots of hardwood make for its own feel. The people behind the counter are always friendly, but definitely spacey, so for take out you need to ask sometimes if your food is ready in case it&#39;s just sitting there.The wait varies based on the time of day you go. During down times, ten minutes is the average, although calling in 15 before is preferable at these times. When it is busy, it can take from half an hour to an hour, so bring a friend or a book in that situation.The location is perfect, right off the 5-Fulton, a few blocks from the Panhandle, and close to Divis. Between this place and Matching Half, this corner has completely transformed in the last couple of months into a lively little area.Overall, a great place to sit and have some good New Mexican food. They open in a couple of hours, so my wait isn&#39;t much longer.

I&#39;ve been going to Green Chile for about 5 years now, as I used to live nearby. I must say that their service and food have gone downhill since their move up to McAllister. I was excited for them to occupy a larger space, but now I&#39;m bummed that they moved.One of my favorite things to order here is the regular burrito sans meat &#34;supered&#34;, which I&#39;ve been ordering for years. For some reason since the move they can NOT seem to get this correct. How hard is it to make a burrito without meat that is not their veggie burrito?When they do make orders correct the food is still pretty good, but not as good as it used to be. I miss the old Green Chile. =(

Um. Yum.That&#39;s the only word to describe this place. It&#39;s very cute and casual -- rustic-looking almost. It was a cold San Francisco afternoon, and I was craving soup. I came to the right place!I ordered a bowl of the Green Chili. It was spectacular! Perfect amount of spice, great flavor, and a dollop of sour cream to top it off. I will definitely be back to try some other things on the menu.

Now that I&#39;ve lived in the area for a bit and have had the opportunity to go here many times, I figured it was about time I updated this review. And to remove a few stars.The more I go there and try the various dishes on their menu, the more blah I realize their food is. Even if it may be healthier then traditional mexican, it&#39;s still got to have some good flavor to it. I mean am I crazy for thinking this? Maybe organic/vegan/hipster people dislike flavorful foods? I don&#39;t know.And in a city full of restaurants, service is what&#39;s going to set your place apart from every other place, and at the GCK this holds true. The service from the kids running the place, and the cooks, is horrible. I mean they just really don&#39;t even try. I&#39;ve had 4 orders IN A ROW messed up now, and none of them were really fixed. I&#39;m talking about simple stuff to, and then when I raise the issue with the little girls working there they get defensive about it. The attention to detail by the cooks is really the thing, since it&#39;s them messing up the orders not the girls behind the register.Example: I got a burrito, and wanted to make it a super burrito. This is just where they add guacamole, sour cream and cheese. I asked for NO guacamole on it, and if I could have it on the side. I get the burrito and there is no guacamole on the side. I asked the girl if it was put inside it, and she said &#34;If it&#39;s a super, then it&#39; got guacamole in it&#34;. Ok, remember I asked for NO guacamole on it? She says &#34;Oh ya, there isn&#39;t any on it&#34;. Not very convincing since you just told me it did. I asked her if she could ask the cooks - they didn&#39;t remember.I asked if I could get a new burrito since now it had been like 20 minutes, it was cold, and we had no idea what was in it. She said the cooks would open it up for me, and if there was no guacamole in it they would have&#34;no choice&#34; but to charge me for a new one, or I could eat the now cold one they were about to open.Really?So the cook opens it up, and what do you know - there is no guacamole on it. With a *sigh* I watch them wrap the burrito back up, give me a little side of guacamole and I head home with my cold burrito.End of the story? Pfft no way, I still have a burrito to eat.So I get home, unwrap the burrito and start to eat its cold remains. As I get about 1/2 way done I realize that not only is there no guacamole on it, but no cheese or sour cream either!For real?!?!I felt like I wanted to go down there, put them all in a line and then 3 stooges slap everyone!!So in the end I got a cold burrito that wasn&#39;t made correctly, I paid for something I didn&#39;t get, I was given a hard time by the cooks and the girl working there, and had an hour of my life wasted that I&#39;ll never get back...This sound like a ridiculous story? I&#39;ve got many more, but hey just go here yourself. Then you&#39;ll have an equally ridiculous story to share on Yelp!

Currently one of my favorite spots for lunch. I wish it were in my neighborhood! Every time I get over to the Fillmore, I stop and have lunch here. You&#39;ve got to try the roasted chicken w/green chile rub, and mashed potatoes. Their soup is delicious, you can get it veggie if you want. I had it with pork. They also have really good coffee (blue bottle I think), and a great atmosphere. The restaurant is on the corner, and they have community picnic tables inside. There are lots of windows, and the place is large and airy.

I might&#39;ve expected too much from this place as my friend told me it was New Mexican food and I was hoping for something that wasn&#39;t your generic Mexican food. I&#39;ve never been to New Mexico, I don&#39;t know what their particular cuisine is like, but I&#39;m always up for trying new types of food.It tasted like your average Mexican food... Over-priced Mexican food at that. My question is: what makes it New Mexican? The blue tortilla? The lackluster green chile? The food is decent and portions are decent (I couldn&#39;t finish my enchilada plate, but I was pretty close). While it was good, it was also uninspired and not at all memorable.My rating is exactly what it is, &#34;A-OK&#34;.

While I consider it &#34;burritos for the bourgeoisie,&#34; I can&#39;t complain about free range chicken and hormone free steak, fresh made sour cream and my plate not dripping with grease.Faves: breakfast burrito with bacon, super nachos with steak and christmas chile, and blue corn flat plate enchiladas. (Did I say $2 Pacifico?)Come, sit at the bar, talk to my friends and enjoy a delicious meal.Then head down Baker to Chile Pies and fall in love with the Chocolate Peanut Butter pie :)

I ate here for lunch today. I have eaten here many times and usually enjoy it. I think that if I would have written this review on any of my other experiences it would have been four star but lunch was disappointing.I went with Roommate while we were doing laundry down the street.I had the best of everything veggie salad with the creamy dressing...forget which one it was...salad and dressing were super tasty. I also got a cheese tamale....and instead they served me chicken which I took a bite of, which...is sad...because i dont eat meat....so...yeah that was a downer. So then I went and told them and they gave me a veggies one...which....was okay but I wanted cheese so....there you have it.Roommate had the Chile Relleno which was cold in the inside. Instead of taking it off the plate and reheating is alone they i think put the whole plate in the microwave or the oven or something because the plate was steaming. This was especially unfortunate because there was fresh lettuce and tomatoes on the plate which were just not as good looking after.

Green Chile Kitchen has really cheap Pacifico ($2!), delicious food, and a fun, comfortable atmosphere. A quick dinner out here with a friend had him waxing rhapsodic about how food like this was the reason he loves living in the Bay Area.It can be a little loud by the counter, so minus half a star for having to yell my order at the woman at the register, apparently unsuccessfully, because (minus another half star) the only thing about my burrito that was what I asked for was the color of the chile on top of it. I&#39;d usually take off more, but I couldn&#39;t bring myself to do it because the beef burrito with black beans was incredibly good, but it&#39;s still not the pork and pinto that I asked for.Anyhow. If you go in knowing that this is food from New Mexico and not Mexico and you don&#39;t mind a little noise, I highly recommend Green Chile Kitchen.Bonus points if you stop by Chile Pies and Ice Cream a block away on your way home for pie and/or delicious Three Twins ice cream. (The Venetian Coffee is particularly good.)

The prices are just too damn high!Ok, but seriously let me start from the beginning. This is the first time I have been back to Green Chile since their move. First of all, I love their new location. I think it is just right; the old place was just too crowded.As for the food, I had the steak burrito and a side of guacamole. Its really good food to be honest. I really enjoyed it. Nice presentation and it is definitely a notch above your favorite five dollar burrito joint (which usually tend to be in the Mission). Their guacamole is pretty god damn good if you ask me. It is one of the best guacamoles I have had in this entire city. I will certainly be back if only to get some take out guac. The burrito was also really good, and their extra effort in tastefully dabbing on guacamole sour cream and salsa while making it a super did not go unnoticed.Now lets talk about why I&#39;m giving it 3 stars. Bottom line, the price is just too damn high. I paid nearly twenty dollars for the guacamole appetizer and super burrito! If they could drop the price by just one dollar on every entree I would automatically give it 4 stars. Nonetheless, since I live around the corner, its a nice addition and I will be back, but I wouldn&#39;t go out of my way for it.

I love the atmosphere here, the lights are low, the smell of sizzling chiles and grilled meats hangs in the air, and you drink your ice water out of a mason jar.I knocked this down to 3 stars because I actually was not blown away by the food. I know there are a lot of positive reviews, and I liked what I got, but it just didn&#39;t change my life. I had the Blue Corn Flat Enchiladas with pork. The dish is supposed to come with ground beef, but the menu mentions you can also have it filled with chicken, pork, cheese, or veggies, whatever. I just thought the pork, which was cubed not shredded, was kind of tough and not too flavorful. And the rice and beans were good, but I&#39;ve had better. And everything seemed just a little heavy.Maybe it was an off night, maybe I was off. I live around the corner, and it was pretty good, so I&#39;ll definitely be back, I hope to be more impressed next time.

This place has a nice vibe but I had way too high of expectations. It&#39;s nice that a place has cool decor and a nice drink selection but if the food is terrible, then it&#39;s all just a waste. To be fair, I&#39;ve only been here once and I got the crispy tacos. The tacos were gross and the rice and beans were even worse. They completely missed the mark. It&#39;s not that hard to make good tacos, rice and beans. They failed big time. I&#39;m curious to see if maybe it was just an off night.....maybe their salads are a lot better. I don&#39;t know, I&#39;ll probably never come to this place again.

Just made my first visit to Green Chili Kitchen (at their new location...) based on my neighbor&#39;s recommendation. The space is bright and inviting - much more appealing than their old, darker place on Fulton. (Though the new location is the site of several previous failed restaurants - let&#39;s see if GCK survives at this spot...!)... but on this occasion, I opted for a burrito to go. I got the Nieman Ranch steak &#34;super&#34; burrito with the no-so-hot green chili sauce. At about ~$10, it&#39;s a little bit more than I&#39;m used to paying for a burrito (and just a little bit more than the comparable Papalote). But the burrito is big, quite tasty, and the blue corn chips &amp; spicy salsa that come with the burrito are very tasty.Good, solid, burrito (though not a match for Papalote!) But - I think I need to go back and eat at GCK to get a better sense of the place.

Great New Mexican fare! I was in San Francisco for a few days last weekend and came upon the Green Chile Kitchen through the WHERE book in our hotel room of all places. We were actually thinking of getting a burrito in the Mission, but I love New Mexican cuisine and we decided to try this instead. Glad we did; I loved the laid back vibe and the food was excellent. It came out steaming hot, which is always a pleasure. It was busy, but not packed for a midday Sunday. I got the savory pork sopapillas with Christmas sauce and my dad went for the green chile roasted pork burrito. Both were well seasoned, fresh, and tasted great. I went for the mild, but I probably should have gone with hot because I do like some kick to the sauces.

If there&#39;s one thing that San Francisco is sorely lacking in its collection of restaurants, it&#39;s got to be Regional American food. GCK goes a long way in correcting that by being the only place in town that servers New Mexican (as in the state, New Mexico) cuisine, and more specifically, chile covered everything.This is not really a taqueria - sure they have burritos and the like, but really the main reason to come here is for the chile-based items - especially the chile stew. Although the red chile sauce is pretty good, I prefer the green - spicy and flavorful to say the very least. The enchiladas are a great way to bring out the flavor of the sauces as well. I&#39;m pretty stoked to come back and try the breakfast options.In terms of the pricing, I guess if you compare this place to Farolito or Cancun, it&#39;s going to look expensive, but don&#39;t be fooled by the casual setup (i.e. order at the counter, get a table and wait). The truth is that the food is better than what you&#39;d get at some upscale nonsense place like Tres Agaves and definitely worth the price.

I went here today to get a to-go plate for my grandma. She is from Santa Fe and LOVES NM style cooking, especially red chili from Hatch Co.We got her 2 tamale plate with sides. She didn&#39;t care for the pinto beans, but I thought they were good. She wanted re-fried - ah well, I tried.She thought the massa was perfect and the pork super tender - I agreed! I can&#39;t wait to go back to get a dinner for home. They have 1/4, 1/2 or whole green chili rubbed chickens togo!PS - please have flan next time, you were out today!!!!

I remember the first time I ran into this place on accident. At the time was only a couple of blocks from my place and boy was it a find. It turned into one of my favorite places to grab mexican in city. Pretty much everything on the menu is delicious. The service is great and the wait time for food is pretty quick. Make sure try the green chile stew and their burritos.

I&#39;ve lived around the corner from Green Chile for two years now (through their move to their new location) and I give them two stars only because every once in a while, I have an extremely tasty burrito there. But it&#39;s only two because of the many, many, many experiences I have had there where I have waited forever for a burrito I even called in to order ahead of time and it takes more than 30 minutes even when the place isn&#39;t that packed. It&#39;s a bit crazy actually, and it seems that even though they moved to a larger location, their cooking line has remained the same size and capacity.The other thing is the food. Like I said, every once in a while there is a truly amazing burrito that comes off that line. But it&#39;s hit or miss... many times their chicken or pork is really dry (and I&#39;m glad they use organic sustainably raised stuff, another reason for 2 and not 1 star), and often the ingredients are bland or not even what I asked for. Is New Mexican food just wimpy Mexican food? When I ask for hot, I want some heat. Oh, and their salads? I got one a week ago with some supermarket pre-shredded cheese blend, canned beans and dry chicken cubes on the side. Trader Joe&#39;s does better.So in summation, this place has awesome stuff going for it: location, atmosphere, mason jars, organic ingredients, cool staff. But it needs to live up to its hype: make good food and make it consistently! and if you&#39;re doing take-out, make it ready when you say it will be! Why do I keep going back? That mythical delicious burrito stays in my mind as I walk my dog past its doors each day, just like the mythical wave stays in my mind as I paddle out into absolute crap. It has so much promise, and it is local and it is responsible so I will always choose it over, say, Chipotle. But for reliability, honesty and fun, I&#39;ll be headed to the Papa(lote) much more often.

One of my pet peeves is when a restaurant doesn&#39;t make it clear how to order and how you are seated. Would it kill you to have one of those double-sided signs that says &#34;please seat yourself&#34; on one side and &#34;please wait to be seated&#34; on the other? Apparently. You look through the menus (on a table near the door), order at the counter, and then find a table and they bring the food out to you. This should save the 90 seconds of awkwardness we had while figuring out what to do.The food was pretty good, although nothing to write home about. Nobody was dissatisfied in the least, and the menu was just creative enough to bump the place from three to four stars. No complaints.

My dinner last night was actually more of a 3* dinner, but since I&#39;ve had pretty great meals there 2 or 3 times in the past, I decided to go ahead and round it up to 4*.All the veggies seem to be very fresh, and I really like the fact that they have free-range chicken and hormone-free beef (even though I don&#39;t eat the stuff).In the past we&#39;ve gotten the grilled burritos (super yummy!) and the nachos (also yummy). We haven&#39;t been wowed by their quesadillas, very little food for the dollar.I&#39;d say their grilled burritos are 5*. I could have just shared that with my husband last night (with the &#34;hot&#34; green chile sauce, which wasn&#39;t actually all that spicy) and been satisfied, but we also decided to try out the tamale plate, with one cheese tamale (for me, the vegetarian) and one pork tamale (for him, the carnivore). That&#39;s where the restaurant lost a couple of stars. The tamales were both just kind of blah. Mine seemed to be undercooked. I think that&#39;s why my stomach was a little off later that night, the undercooked masa. It also had kind of a sour taste, I&#39;m not sure if that was the cheese or the salsa or what, but it was a weird, unappetizing flavor.The service is friendly, and the new location is much bigger which is nice. The sound really bounces off the walls though, so it gets pretty loud. It was also pretty cold in there, also probably because of the cavernous space. Maybe they could do something about that?

I&#39;m not an expert on New Mexican cuisine, but I liked some of the items we tried quite a bit. As countless others have noted, it gets very crowded and seems pretty family-friendly - or, noisy. You order at the counter and the food can be brought out to you, but I&#39;d probably get it to go next time. The atmosphere isn&#39;t BAD and the music&#39;s nice, but it gets a bit chaotic.Anyway, more importantly, the food: it&#39;s pretty solid. The rotisserie chicken was surprisingly good. Normally I&#39;m pretty bored by this type of dish, but it was actually cooked to perfection, yielding a nice crispy skin and juicy meat. The rice was good and the tortillas (both corn and especially flour) were outstanding. The pinto beans were quite plain and bland, I thought, but not bad. I had the pozole, which I liked a lot - there was abundant hominy and nice chunks of chicken. I was surprised to find that I didn&#39;t like the green chile stew, which I had expected to be a stand-out. The pork was succulent but I found the stew to be too soupy and acidic. I had a bite of the enchiladas and was not too impressed - they seemed a bit bland. We also had the tamales appetizer - very good masa and tasty meat, although not quite enough meat for me. Anyway, I&#39;d definitely come back and get the chicken, pozole, and maybe try a few other things.

I have been craving tacos badly and I had to find a place that was not in the mission that served amazing tacos. Lo and behold, my friend suggested this place to me and it was glorious!I got the soft taco plate with steak and it was to die for. Great portions, it was more than what I had expected.If you expect pure mexican tacos, this isn&#39;t the place. It&#39;s more of an Americanized version but well worth it.I also got the Posole stew, it was definitely an interesting combination, it could have been a bit hotter (temperature wise), but I still enjoyed it.Good place, good vibes, good food.Parking may be hard to find, but well worth it!

We had a few things here in order to get a full spectrum. The chips and guac were ok simple is always best and that&#39;s what it was. The enchilada combo plate was next. The taco was mediocre at best and was super dry. The tamale was ok however the meat or the masa could use some chili powder to give it something more and make it not so plain. I really feel like the blue corn was a great idea however it&#39;s a fine line when using this type of masa. Maybe it&#39;s because I have made hundreds of tamales every x-mas with my family my entire life that I just expect a little more then what was on my plate. The enchiladas were the clear favorite on the plate as I felt this was well executed with the right amount of sauce and cheese. They are done New Mexico style so the tortillas are laid flat and stacked with ingredients vs rolled. The star of the show was the chicken hominy soup. This was a well executed dish even though a little fresh cilantro would of knocked it out of the ball park. It didn&#39;t have a lot of spice but the flavor was good enough for me.

Could be better, could be worse, could probably be more appropriately located in Pac. Heights or the Marina. Kinda looks like they&#39;re going for a: &#34;semi-classy and food beyond burritos&#34; Mexican place (disclaimer: I waited outside with the dog, so I only really peaked in).The burrito tasted fresh, and I enjoyed the crispy rather than greasy tortilla. However, after being asked over the phone whether I wanted green or red chili and spicy or mild, disappointment came over me like a wave when the &#34;spicy green chili&#34; appeared neither green nor spicy. Sigh.Outside seating seems nice, although it&#39;s on Fulton, so you may taint your foods with a mouthful of car exhaust.

If it&#39;s been more than 3 days between my visits, my friends start asking me what&#39;s going on.Awesome burritos every time. Friends visiting from New Mexico said this place is legit because of the &#34;Christmas&#34; option on the menu. (Both red and green chile). Either way, I wouldn&#39;t care because this place serves up some bomb nomnom.

I met the owner, Trevor, at SFO airport and he gave me his business card when I told him I was from Santa Fe.I had family in town from NM and we decided to try out the food. Wow! What an unexpected treat! We had a party of eight and with much skepticism we ordered our chili rellanos, The food was very authentic and very tasty. I ordered the hotter chili, and it was just right, not overwhelming like it can get, but just right!The service is semi-self-serve, we ordered at the counter and the food was brought to our table.It is the best New Mexican food in San Francisco!

This is not Mexican food it is New Mexican food which might account for the lack of flavor?One thing they really have going for them though is the extensive breakfast menu with vegetarian options, which is served until 2pm on the weekend.I get the soyrizo breakfast burrito when I&#39;m in a hangover induced jam, without the red or green chili though because I don&#39;t think either one is very good.I read one review that said they might fare better in the Marina and I think that is probably pretty accurate.

So I finally went to the new location on Baker St. The food is still 5 stars! The downside: the new space, furniture and general ambiance have knocked GCK down a star for me. It&#39;s starting to feel like a chain. The intimate, authentic feeling is a lot less prevalent than in the old location. Also, the addition of a wine/ espresso bar seems silly compared to the way the old restaurant looked/felt. The service has also gone down. It was always kinda DIY at the old location but there is hardly any staff around and the new place is 3 times as big. I&#39;m definitely still a fan but it&#39;s not one of my very favorite restaurants anymore.

Great food but they can never get my order right. Simple things like no green chili inside the burrito. Pork tamales when I ordered chicken. Happened about 4 times. You can&#39;t tell if the order is correct until you get home. Like I&#39;m gonna open my tamale to check if its chicken. Very pricey as well. You can buy their green chili sauce and make your own burritos : )

I don&#39;t even get some of these reviews, talking about it being expensive. Come on people, they&#39;re doing a service, have to be rent, supporting local and organic as well.Anyhow, I tried them for the first time today, went with the Chicken Burrito (it&#39;s Fulton Valley, or if you get beef it&#39;s Niman Ranch). Served with the usual ingredients, but I found their green chile sauce to be perfectly spiced.You get blue corn tortillas as well, with a choice of some gourmet salsas, not all in all a bad deal.For those who live in the neighborhood, they also have a small but good selection of inexpensive organic wines, easy to pick up on your way home or to a friend&#39;s place.Also for take out, you can buy a whole or half Fulton Valley roasted chicken, that comes with mashed potatoes, yummy instant meal!They also served breakfast, starting at 9am, and I hear their breakfast burrito is a pretty solid way to start your day.

This place is in the old Cafe Neon space and it&#39;s light years ahead of what Cafe Neon was. It&#39;s one block from my house, and I stand in front of it nearly every morning to catch a 5 Fulton bus, but today was my first day inside since they moved up the block.They did wonderful things with the interior of the space. They also have a great menu. I had the breakfast tacos and my wife had the breakfast burrito. Everything was great, from the tacos to the pinto beans to the posole. In fact, the posole was so good that I might just get a bowl of that next time I go.I forsee many nights of takeout from this place.

When you move to a new city, you have to go around and find where to get the best of your favorite foods.When I lived in Boston, one of my favorite taquerias, Boca Grande, had this Posole that I would crave. The pork. The hominy. The cilantro. Squeeze of lime with tortilla chips on the side. Yum!It&#39;s been four years, and I have found my fairly comparable Posole at Green Chile Kitchen. Of course I have to admit, I didn&#39;t look that hard either. I just thought somehow I would come across it at some Mexican place.... I mean, there are certainly plenty in SF! But alas, I hadn&#39;t. So today I typed in Posole in Yelp and up came Green Chile Kitchen.Although Green Chile Kitchen makes their Posole with chicken instead of pork slightly spicy, tender chicken.. it had great flavor and was extremely satisfying. It even came with cute little mini tortillas...**** Food Story Number 2****I have a rather interesting relationship with tamales. I never really loved them, but rather I loved the concept. In my mind, how can a corn-meal concoction stuffed with meat or cheese, then steamed in its own husk not be absolutely delicious? The concept of it alone gives me a food orgasm. Perhaps that goes for a lot of porn fantasies.. seems like fun, but if you were to put it into practice, not so much. Everywhere I go, I order tamales. I then say &#34;why did I get this tamale.. i don&#39;t even like tamales.&#34; ...It&#39;s because of the concept. I guess tamales is one of those foods that, if it&#39;s only okay, it&#39;s not worth eating, but when it&#39;s good, it is awesomely orgasmically good.Green Chile Kitchen fulfilled my tamale orgasm - FINALLY! I ordered a tamale with cheese and it was moist, fluffy, flavorful. They put a chile in there so it gave it a mild heat, which always helps... with cheese oozing out.Okay, sorry. TMI.

Best burrito I&#39;ve had in the city so far. Granted, I&#39;ve only lived here for 7 months and haven&#39;t explored the Mission taquerias as much as I want so that might change (I still haven&#39;t found that ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE burrito yet). Like other reviewers have noted, this is NEW Mexican food.Don&#39;t get scared away by the spiciness of the chiles, it&#39;s really not that bad. All in all, it&#39;s a great concept to make everything so chile-oriented. Extremely high quality of ingredients, which lead to great burritos. Great chips too, love the mason jars, and I especially love the ambiance.Unlike most taquerias, it&#39;s actually a place where you might stay and chill/talk with a friend after you finish your meal, it&#39;s a great place to go and hang out. I love the high ceilings, dim light, and good music (seriously, have you ever heard Radiohead or Wilco while getting a burrito somewhere?)

Just as I was getting bummed about having to go all the way to the Mission to get my burrito fix, I finally tried out Green Chile. Boy was I missing out, it took me six months to walk two blocks to try this joint out.Mouthwatering goodness is how I would describe that beautiful chicken burrito. They use Fulton Valley roasted chicken, and you can choose red or green (or both!) chile on top of it. They also have $2 pacificos.The ambiance is lovely inside, although it sometimes takes awhile to get a table. For then I get to annihilate my burrito in the privacy of my home...

my boyfriend seems to think that I work for Green Chili. that&#39;s because I literally go there about 4 times a week ... breakfast, lunch, dinner [especially breakfast!] - matters not. I love the food.I love the fact that they use only Niman Ranch and Fulton Valley meats. I love that Pacificos are only $2 ALL THE TIME. I love the salsas. a great place for the veggies amongst us, too.I especially love the breakfast bowl [think: whole beans, salsa roja, add a little chicken - simply the best fuel for my day!!]if you&#39;re looking for a giganto-burrito, probably not the place to try, but if you want good, fresh, clean food you can eat in one sitting, I give you GCK.

Like, for white people who have Taco Tuesday and call the Mexican people they know &#34;hispanics.&#34;I guess they&#39;re allowed because it&#39;s &#34;new Mexican&#34; cuisine instead of &#34;Mexican Food,&#39; which I assume is their validation for a $10 burrito.Ultimately, this shit is good in a &#34;I CAN believe it&#39;s not Mexican&#34; way. The salsa is bomb, the atmosphere is pleasant, and I feel comfortable taking my mom here when she visits from Marin.

the crispy taco is filled with a ton of flavorful meat but it doesn&#39;t taste any better than a taco bell taco. the nachos were okay. i think the idea of &#34;new mexican&#34; isn&#39;t for me. you could tell the ingredients were good and everything tasted kind of healthy, but i think i&#39;ll stick to greasy taqueria tacos/nachos. $16 for nachos and a single taco is not okay.

I came here for a working dinner with my bosses. They picked the place.Although I had to talk and eat at the same time, my tastebuds were literally exploding. We ordered the green chili fries as we walked in and saw them bringing some out. I had the green chili stew. So good! Just the right amount of spicy.Everything that came out of the kitchen looked delicious and like many many reviewers have said, this is NEW MEXICAN food. They are also using organic meats which is a real bonus.I left there craving the food and thinking about the next time I can get in there for some more.They also have beer and wine. I ordered Sangria. It was good, LOTS of ice, little sangria, little fruit, but tasty.This is an order at the counter then sit down kind of place but it&#39;s very clean and friendly.

3.5 startsI actually eat here all the time since it opened. The only item i really like is the breakfast burrito but everything else on the menu is just alright. The only reason I keep dinning here is because it&#39;s around the corner from my house and it&#39;s a nice change from Mexican food once in awhile.

LOVE!My friend and I foolishly decided to get hungry around 9 p.m. on a Friday night without reservations in the Divis area. Whoops. But lo and behold, just a few blocks away, is Green Chile Kitchen! With seating! A miracle in SF, I must say.I&#39;m a vegetarian so I can only speak to the veggie options, but they are fabulous. Prices are very reasonable for San Francisco (seriously, a burrito and chips for $5? I&#39;ve paid more at a Mission taqueria!) though I&#39;m told the meat options get a little pricey (guess it&#39;s that fancy-schmancy organic meat).The veggie burrito was fabulous and enough for two meals. Soft taco plate was delish -- you can mix and match. I wasn&#39;t a fan of the tofu (something about the sauce) but I tried a few bean ones and was thoroughly impressed. Plus they have $2 beer (I want to say Pacifico) and you really can&#39;t beat that.I love this place -- cute cozy little restaurant, great food, great prices and tucked far enough off Divis that you won&#39;t be battling the crowds for a seat, even on a weekend.

Finally! A southwestern restaurant in San Francisco! They said it didn&#39;t exist...amazingly, one such place does. While it&#39;s not nearly great enough or comprehensive to satisfy the urges of a southwestern foodie, Green Chile Kitchen does a great job &#34;repping&#34; new mexico in an honest fashion. The food here is really down-home kitchen food, not done up, bobbly flay-style explorations in chile-based flavors. Which is fine.I had the blue corn enchilada with chorizo and it was really great. The ingredients all seemed fresh, and the big thing is that you need to &#34;add christmas&#34;, as the menu says. &#34;Adding Christmas&#34; means covering your plate with half roja and verde chile sauce. This is a must-do for anything you order here, because chiles are the whole point!Anyways, it was greatly enjoyable, great residential location, great for breakfast or lunch or dinner. Basically just great. They have honest tea, mexican coke, and spicy hot chocolate too.

I have been there for breakfast and lunch countless times, only to leave with nothing but love for this place. So I went for dinner the other night with a friend and ordered the crispy tacos. The guacamole, refried beans and rice were still of the same genius ilk, but the chicken had absolutely no flavor, not like the roasted chicken, which is stupendous. Maybe it was the wrong thing to get? Or have they just started this new flavorless chicken thing? Hmmmmmm....

One of my favorite places in San Francisco. Awesome environment and excellent food that always tastes so fresh. The burritos are delicious as is their taco salad. It can be a little on the pricey side, but totally worth it. They also offer an interesting selection of alcoholic beverages like sangria. So good!

Yum! I am a HUGE fan of Southwestern Mexican food....so much so that I actually stopped in Hatch, NM to get chiles on a road trip across the US. Needless to say, I was psyched to try a place that uses green chiles with wild abandon! I am pretty shocked to hear that people think this place is expensive -- for the quality of food you&#39;re getting, fresh ingredients (and the atmosphere, which is LOT nicer than most take-out places...you can actually sit and hang out here) this food is a total steal. Not to mention the $2 Pacificos. I&#39;ve had dinner a few times here, but I absolutely must come back to try the Huevos Rancheros for breakfast.

Wow!! I only wish I lived in San Francisco so I could eat at this place all the time. The food is absolutely delicious! Authentic New Mexican food at at its best, trust me you don&#39;t want to miss out on this place.I can agree with negative reviewers that the prices are a little high but the quality of chiles (red/ green) and meat are better than most places around town. You get what you pay for. The service is also very quick and helpful. There is a tall blonde girl that assisted me, she took ample time (despite the morning rush) to help me decide on the perfect breakfast item. I ordered the breakfast burrito and my friend ordered the healthy breakfast bowl- both totally delicious and healthy! This place also has yummy mimosas and sangria. Love it! Next time I&#39;m in the bay you can find me here.

I came here with a big group of people for the Burrito Brotherhood (a burrito eating club one of our friends started).I had the green chile roasted pork burrito plate. It was quite tasty! A burrito with potatoes and cheese? That wins me over. The plate came with a side of rice and calabacitas - sauteed zucchini, yellow squash, corn &amp; green chile. I also tried the super nachos with Niman Ranch steak that someone in the group ordered. Yum!I liked that they used glass canning jars for water glasses. Quite rustic but charming. The people who ring you up are friendly as well. I hear their breakfast burrito is good. I hope to try that sometime. I definitely recommend this place.

I live down the street so I really really really want to love this place. I like it, but a few things -1) They mess my order up most of the time. Today, they put rice in the burrito. Last time they gave me a regular tortilla when I asked for whole wheat. Nothing terrible, but it&#39;s annoying.2) It takes way too long - I was told 10 minutes for my burrito today and it took more than 20!Ingredients are quality, price point is reasonable, space is nice and open and it seems like they treat their employees well.

I used to literally live across the street...so close i could pick up their wifi from my pad. Now that I&#39;ve moved downtown I definitely don&#39;t get there as much as i should...especially since i probably used to go there once or twice a week.In general - yes the prices are a lil steep for the impecunious college student however their food is just generally so out of this world incredible its worth it. Definitely have to recommend their Chicken Tamales or Posole. If you&#39;re a vegetarian....the tofu soft tacos are soooo filling and yummy. I&#39;m also a big fan of places where the staff recognizes and acknowledges their regulars. I&#39;ve definitely been given a free drink every now and then plus one time when I showed up right as they were closing they gave me some free flan.You can probably get some cheaper (and slightly more authentic) Mexican food down in the Mission...but if you want amazing food thats well worth the price, homey environment, chill staff, free wifi and delicious spicy hot chocolate thats the size of a household pet...GCK is def the place.

It was a rainy day when I came across this place. I looked at the menu and was attracted immediately by the various herbs and flavors used in their different dishes. You can tell that a lot of thought was put into making each menu item unique from all the others. It also looked clean and nicely decorated inside.I got the three tacos special and tried pork, beef, and chicken. I got the extra &#34;super&#34; add-ons (cheese, guac, sour cream). The staff is very attentive and friendly.I have had many Mexican meals throughout Arizona and Southern California. Some of the best new Mexican restaurants in Arizona charge a lot for a meal of this quality. This unique New Mexican flavor has been hard to find in Northern California. The prices are very reasonable and I may be making more trips up to San Francisco from the south bay just to eat at this place again. Maybe I&#39;ll try one of their bottles of organic wine.There is something I love about stumbling across a restaurant that becomes one of my favorites. The charm of the food quality, decorations, menu, and service all make me feel like this kitchen was waiting for me and that I was their new favorite customer!Shouldn&#39;t every restaurant make you feel this way?

Good Mexican restaurant. I like the ambiance. Food comes out and it is super hot so wait so you don&#39;t burn your mouth ha ha. The people who take your order are super nice. I expected a taqueria style restaurant but it is more of a sit down. Apparently they have a pie shop next door also that has good reviews. When I come here again, I need to make sure they don&#39;t put the green sauce on top of the burritos so if you don&#39;t like your burrito wet style ask for it without sauce on top.

Dear GCK, I love your food, and it&#39;s great you have upgraded to the larger new location but... you gotta do something about the heat. The new location is cold cold and very drafty. Every time I have been there, I have eaten with my coat on. Not a very comfortable dining environment. I think also, because the room is so cold, my food has been consistently luke warm, unless it was a burrito. So sad cause I really like my food hot.Heat is better the heat is better!!!! yyaaaaayyy!!

Green Chili Kitchen is one of the best--and most underrated--brunch spots in SF, especially for those of us living on the West Side. Christmas lights, wooden tables, and funky, vibrant serving dishes give it a homey feel, and low prices complete the laid-back vibe.Their fresh and healthy approach comes through in every recipe. I love to order a breakfast burrito--fluffy eggs, fried potatoes, Niman Ranch bacon, and cheese, garnished with mind-blowing salsa--with a mimosa or a mug of organic, spicy hot chocolate. Although their regular burritos can&#39;t really compete with Mission District offerings, they, too, are made from great quality ingredients.

This used to be one of my favorite spots in the City. Good enchiladas, burritos, authentic New Mexican chile, good vibes.However, my last two visits were incredibly disappointing. I waited 40 minutes for a burrito and the place wasn&#39;t that busy. Everybody standing around waiting for someone to take charge. The burrito itself was lackluster and a absolute ripoff for ten bucks. The cincher was the complete lack of chile. I mean really! New Mexican food is all about the chile. All I tasted was sour cream.Better step up your game Green Chile Kitchen!!

I&#39;ve never been, but I&#39;m so glad I now know about this place. The breakfast burrito with chicken, smothered in red sauce, was SO F&#39;ing GOOD...i finished the entire thing. I had a cup of coffee too with agave syrup. All of it was yummy.I&#39;m sure lunch and dinner are good there, but I&#39;ll probably go for their breakfast burritos exclusively.

Perhaps we ordered the wrong items (him--the steak burrito and me the veggie chili) but our food was bland and lacking flavor. The flour tortillas seemed straight out of the grocery store (however the corn tortillas are handmade). In conclusion, we probably will not be returning to green chile and regret not going to nopalito (it was a close second for the night).

I&#39;m from New Mexico. And let me just say, there really isn&#39;t anything in the world like New Mexico green chile. And there&#39;s nowhere else to get it but New Mexico. Don&#39;t say canned -- canned just doesn&#39;t cut it for me. I actually sneaked across the California border once with a 40-lb bag of fresh green chile in the back of my car. The smell was surely gonna give me away at the agricultural stop, but it was my lucky day and they just waved me by! A few other times I&#39;ve driven back from New Mexico with a cooler full of frozen, fresh roasted. But as the years go by, it gets harder to get my ass back to NM. And ordering it by mail costs more than driving there.I&#39;m happy to say, Green Chile Kitchen scratches my itch. I think they get theirs frozen, Bueno brand genuine NM chile, shipped in no doubt at great expense. And frankly, I appreciate it.Their green chile chicken enchilada plate was loaded with the aforementioned green gold. I ordered mine hot, and while it wasn&#39;t the hottest chile I&#39;ve ever had, it did make my nose run a little. Ah, the nostalgia!I should digress a moment to mention the other serious nostalgia this place holds for me. I lived in the Western Addition for 10 years, until I was pried from my rent-controlled apartment by an owner move-in eviction. Driving around for 20 minutes looking for parking near Green Chile Kitchen reminded me why I&#39;m so much happier now that I&#39;ve moved to Oakland. Parking in this neighborhood SUCKS!Back to the food: I had a little taste of the red chile, and really, mine is so much better. Too bad I&#39;m not for hire. Also, I vastly prefer my own posole. So I guess I will just be coming here for a fix of the green stuff. If only they&#39;d also make sopaipillas...

Its really close to where I live so I usually order a take-out dinner on my way back from work and pick it up. I usually get a steak burrito, which I like way better than anything from Tacqueria Cancun or Maya in SOMA.

This place is solid. I have never had a bad meal here and always leave feeling like I spent my money well. On the other hand, it doesn&#39;t completely blow me away. Regardless, I have been here many times for a decent meal. Sundays seem the time to go but they move people through quickly so you don&#39;t have to wait more than 15 minutes, usually. I think I am more excited about trying the Chile Pies and Ice Cream shop that they opened up where the old Green Chile used to be located. That place has awesome written all over it.

Went here for brunch and was pleasantly surprised at how much I liked the food. My review isn&#39;t getting five stars because I haven&#39;t eaten there for dinner.I ordered a Jr. burrito, which is perfect for a person who has somewhat of an appetite but doesn&#39;t feel like being passed out all day due to a food coma. I ordered my chili mild and my husband&#39;s hot. His wasn&#39;t too hot, but I preferred mine as I could still taste my food without needing water after every bite. I&#39;m not a baby about eating spicy foods either; I typically prefer spice. Just not this time.I will definitely go back.

The breakfast tacos and burritos are outstanding, with fresh, local and organic everything. Oh yea! The tacos came with rice, beans and what they refer to as a &#39;side of pozole&#39; which is really more of a cock tease of pozole. It leaves you wanting more. Nice, friendly staff and an open and airy set up make this a great place for early afternoon. Oh crap - tons of organic wines and sangria as well - even some from Mendo!

After watching the seriously talented dancers at the SF Ethnic Dance Festival, we were famished! Especially since it was 4pm and the last time we ate was 10am. Passing by this neighborhood restaurant, we decided to stop in and give it a try.I am seriously glad we did. The place was fairly empty but filled up with locals by the time we left. The staff was friendly and helpful but not overbearing. I couldn&#39;t make up my mind between the salad and the salmon fish tacos (Yes, salmon! I had the same thought....where is the white fish?) The staff recommended the salmon tacos and they were AWESOME!!I have to admit, I had a hard time eating them all, especially after finishing off a bowl of the delicious chips and 3 dipping sauces with more salt than should be legal (my sodium count for the month). My date had the chicken enchiladas with the Verde sauce and damn near licked the plate clean.This was a perfect unexpected place for dinner after a relaxing afternoon. If you are ever in the neighborhood, give it a try. With reasonable prices and the ability to park in NOPA, plus an ATM around the corner, how could you go wrong?

A great neighborhood spot. I&#39;m not down with the fact that they charge a dollar extra if you want to get an additional Chile sauce... seems a bit high to me. But, it&#39;s mitigated by the fact that they ALWAYS have $2 Pacificos!My recommendations are as follows (formal, aren&#39;t I?):- Super Nachos. These aren&#39;t the nachos you remember from your childhood. No Velveeta or other processed cheese foods here. It&#39;s not a tall heaping pile of chips, but each triangular tortilla receives individual attention in the way of tender chicken, whole beans, cheese, sour cream, guac and chile of your choice.- Green Chile Quesadilla. Again, not an average quesadilla. There&#39;s red onion, corn and green chile to make it super-tasty.- Tamale Appetizer with a Cup of Chile Verde. Tamales were a little cold when they brought them out, but still delicious flavor-wise. I like adding the stew to round out the meal.Late diners beware, they do close at 9pm every night of the week. For me, Green Chile Kitchen fits under the category of &#34;Easy, Sit-Down, Fulfilling Dinner for About 10 Bucks.&#34; A nice addition to Fulton Street.

Green Chile Kitchen was one of the first restaurants I ate at when I moved to SF 4 years ago. The owner Trevor was also the cashier, and it was in the old location. A lot has changed since then (also why they dropped a star, because it used to be so much more personable and more time and attention went into everything), but the heart of the place is still the same.If you&#39;re going to eat here, definitely either get a burrito or nachos; everything else is a little overpriced. The meat is great quality, the portions are huge, and worth it. Definitely a home away from home for me.

This might sound silly, but I think this place is GREAT (if not a little pricey. But hey, I think Papalote charges up the wazoo for Mexican, too. I come from San Jose, where a delicious burrito should never needs to cost more than 8 bucks. For a super.) EXCEPT for the green and red chile (ironic, I know). I have a friend from New Mexico who gives me legit green chile, and the stuff from this restaurant pales in comparison (and tastes pretty much like watery, salty, tomato skins). So, I just order things that come without out (Hellllllo, crispy tacos) or ask not to have it put on. But if you don&#39;t want to take my word for it, just get it on the side. It&#39;ll keep your food from getting prematurely soggy anyway.

Green Chili Kitchen serves a hybrid burrito which is partly inspired by the Mission style, but also heavily influenced by New Mexican cooking. They use organic/natural ingredients and Niman Ranch beef and pork. The NM inflection comes in the form of the addition of red or green chili sauce in the burrito. They serve a burrito which is my favorite of all time consisting of seasoned ground beef, refried beans, cheese, guacamole, sour cream, rice and green chili sauce. They import their green chilis from NM. And they grill their burritos, too. Their burritos perfectly meld all those components into a gooey, tasty amalgamation of pure bliss. On top of that, they make the most amazingly flavorful and fiery habanero salsa that when added to the mix only raises the stakes to orgasmic.

I&#39;ve had the chicken stew and a chicken burrito- both were quality but I found the burrito more flavorful- got it with green chile. It&#39;s great that they use Niman Ranch, etc, and they have upscale healthy options such as Ciao Bella ice cream (ok not that healthy) and kombucha and other drinks. Also, the house wine is decent and affordable.I tried to call ahead with my order but they put me on hold forever so I gave up- seemed they put me on hold to tie up the lines to avoid calls because they were understaffed. In that case, they should just state they&#39;re not taking call-in orders... I resented being kept waiting. But I&#39;ll still go back if I&#39;m in the neighborhood and have time.

Solid Southwestern style food that also happens to be located right next door to my new favorite nail salon. The nice thing about the Southwestern angle is that the food tends to be healthier than straight up Mexican food.I had the vegetarian green chili. It was really tasty, though I thought a bit too brothy for chili. I think chili should be thick enough to be scooped up with a tortilla, no other implements needed. In this case, I had to do some spoon maneuvering to facilitate the tortilla scoopage. The tortilla was thick and warm and a great accompaniment to the chili.The taco menu looked pretty good as well. They have quite a few vegetarian options so I know I&#39;ll back for round two, probably next time my nails need some TLC.

I live in the neighborhood - this is a place I always suggest if I need to meet someone over lunch. I like the deco and the atmosphere, and the food is pretty good. Not spectacular, not super cheap, not super expensive, not super flavorful, not super unhealthy, not super healthy. You get the drift. I like the green chile stew and the kombucha on tap, the tacos are pretty good, the burritos sauced with chile are OK but somehow are missing on flavor inside (maybe the beans are cooked plain or something). Generally, nice for a casual bite out or lunch, and it really wouldn&#39;t kill the cashiers to smile once in a while. I always feel like awkwardly smiling an extra time or telling a joke when I get a death stare from them.

Hmm. I have wanted to try this place for a long time and finally made it there...Started with the nachos, which were ok... they were a little soupy and they were the kind of nachos where a lot of chips had been layered and then toppings were on the top layer. I don&#39;t like that bc I&#39;m a slow eater so that means I get stuck with the plain soggy chips at the bottom. Equal nachos for all!!Moved onto the combo plate (the one with 3 diff items) in veggie form. The cheese quesadilla was pretty good. The &#34;hot&#34; green chile sauce was not very hot at all. I realize this varies with the batch of green chiles, but maybe if there isn&#39;t a hot batch that week, we can call it something else? I&#39;m just saying.The taco with tofu was pretty good - I can&#39;t really say bc I only had 1 bite of it, but I think the boy liked it. The rice &amp; beans were average (nothing special, but fine).Had to bring the cheese tamale home, but I don&#39;t have the highest expectations.Overall, it was a nice place to try, but the food was bland and the green chile factor wasn&#39;t as a big a draw as I had hoped.

This was the first place I went to using my Green Zebra savings book for 2009 (buy one entree and get the second 1/2 off). Relax, I just got the book like a week ago at Appel and Frank for free so it&#39;s not like I was sitting on it until year&#39;s end.I had been to the old location and it was perfectly fine. Now that they&#39;ve moved up but still on the same block, it forces me to walk an extra 50 paces. John S. doesn&#39;t like this but I&#39;m glad he&#39;s willing to trek the extra block for amazingly good food.I love their Jarritos (especially grapefruit) and the Colombian Gorge selection of smoothies. This is the third place that I&#39;ve seen carry my favorite Mango Cogo smoothie (the others are Faletti&#39;s and Berkeley Bowl).GCK&#39;s nachos and tamales are delicious and it&#39;s decently priced as well. I love how you get options; lots and lots of options! Sour cream, avocado, black/refried/pinto beans, red/green salsa, mild or hot. All of these options JUST FOR ONE APPETIZER of nachos. I can never go wrong with a burrito here either. Come to think of it....I should come here more often.

We stumbled across this place a few weeks back and were very pleasantly surprised! Extremely yummy, not too expensive, and definitely different from anything else I&#39;ve had. The Calabacitas (squash and corn) and cheesy chili potatoes were extremely yummy--so much so that I hoarded mine and didn&#39;t want to share. The portions were also pretty generous and heavy on meat--my taco was probably 85% steak.Can&#39;t wait to go back for more!

Thanks to fellow Yelpers for another great find. Went to Farolito for lunch yesterday, kinda late, and my girlfriend wanted Mexican anyway. What was I to do? There was no way I could kill another burrito, I was somewhat hungry, and then there would be the aftermath to come this AM.So I looked it up. I needed to not drive back to the Mission and I wanted it a little different. And along pops up Green Chile Kitchen.I almost pulled the plug on the venture because of the parking situation over there, but hey, that&#39;s not their fault. I can almost say, though, that the parking pains were worth it.I wanted Nachos, but she ordered a combo plate for me instead; tamale,enchilada and taco. All delicious, but I&#39;m deducting a star because it was look warm. I will definitely come back a lot, and potentially revise the review.Damn though, those nachos looked amazing.

Nice clean Mexican restaurant with lots to choose from on the menu. Good atmosphere to sit and enjoy a meal and good conversation. The only menu items I have tried are the burrito, tamales, summer taco salad, and rotisserie chicken. Burrito was OK (prefer Papalote - cheaper and tastier), tamale was above average, salad was OK, and the chicken was OK ($$). But since this place is only a block away and is a good place to sit and eat AND they have $2 Pacifico&#39;s all day every day I&#39;ll have to give this place 4 stars. I was originally just going to give 3 stars but you get 4 for selling my favorite beer for only $2!!The only pitfall is that it&#39;s a little pricier than normal Mexican restaurant but they use the organic good stuff so i guess it&#39;s not that bad. Just go in there and enjoy a $2 Pacifico! Enjoy!Did I mention they have $2 Pacifico&#39;s?

This place is pretty good. But I grew up in San Diego and the got-daym yummiest tacos and burritos don&#39;t come from a sit down restauraunt staffed with well coiffed middle class chicks. They come from some hole in the wall with a slight to moderate risk of food poisoning. But they&#39;ll make your mouth think its having an orgasm.Plus its cheap.So i&#39;m pretty hard to please when it comes to tacos and burritos at a fine family establishment. The food here is pretty good, relatively well priced, and carries almost zero risk of e coli, salmonella, or those other fun flavors that leave you in the bathroom for hours on end.But honestly its all about the posole.MMMMM POSOLE!!!I think its a little over priced. I mean who wants to pay $7 for wet food? But its definitely worth it if youre a) hungover b)sick with a cold c) ballin&#39; and not concerned about the price tag.Whatever you wanna do, just eat it. This shit is yummy all the time.They also make mean soyrizo breakfast burrito with potatoes in it. Damn Gina! I&#39;m telling you, a couple snaps of chong, a comfy sofa, one of those breakfast burritos and I swear to jeebus it will cure even the nastiest of hangovers.Plus I live like a block away, so when I&#39;m all hungover and look like I got dragged by a truck for mile or two, I call in an order, they have that shit ready in the time it takes to find my debit card, throw on a hoodie and stunna shades, brush my teeth, and drag my ass over there. Sweet deal.

Hey all. It&#39;s not very often you find a totally craveable place like this little gem. And I love that it&#39;s off the beaten trail so it&#39;s got that good neighborhoody feel. Even though I&#39;m actually invading the neighborhood to visit.I usually eat in &#39;cause the atmosphere is almost as delicious as the green sauce. And the prices are awesome, well worth what you&#39;re getting.Oh, and can you say $2 Pacifico? or Niman Ranch beef in the breakfast burrito? But more than anything I can not get enough of the sauces!

I&#39;ve become a bit obsessed with this place recently. It&#39;s a cozy yet spacious corner restaurant with a self-seating setup (equals cheaper), Heath ceramic dishes (awesome choice), great drinks on tap and a delicious menu that is largely organic (all meat, beans and rice are organic/local). The pasole soup is perfect on a cold day and the burrito and enchiladas are super yummy and filling yet never greasy.

I came here a few days ago for lunch. I got a steak quesadilla which was pretty yummy and came with some blue corn tortilla chips. The food was a little bit slow coming out, but, I didn&#39;t mind too much, since I wasn&#39;t in a rush. The food was a bit pricey. I think single tacos were $3.50 each and my quesadilla was $6 or $7. I could see myself coming back here, especially since I live super close by it, but if I didn&#39;t live so close, I&#39;m not sure if it would warrant a special trip.

I&#39;d give the place another quarter star over my last review if I could. The new(ish) location is better organized than when it first opened. The food is a bit more interesting too and good as always. The soups/stews are nice to have over the conventional burrito places (yum). And it still feels like a neighborhood joint.Since it is a sit-down place (order at the counter and they bring to your table) I personally think the interior could be improved a bit. It can get noisy and finding a seat is sometimes hard - the intimacy of the old location is missing. With such a large space it feels a bit too cavernous and dark.I think the one quick improvement? More chips and a salsa bar to fine tune your dining experience.

I&#39;m a local and hop over here about once every two weeks. We had New Mexican food in my hometown growing up, and I&#39;ve been to New Mexico several times. I wouldn&#39;t say this is the best take on New Mexican but it definitely scratches that itch when I have the hankering.Breakfast burritos are stellar and I&#39;m also a big fan of the blue corn crispy tacos. I would recommend the nachos except that the chips have been consistently stale both times I ordered. But I&#39;m thrilled it&#39;s in the neighborhood and take friends there pretty regularly.

I&#39;d probably give 3.5 stars, since the food was good but I&#39;m not yet a fan... Our order was confused multiple times - first we got chicken when we&#39;d asked for a vegetarian posole, no guacamole with the order though we paid extra for it, and one of the appetizers never showed up (it turned out that it hadn&#39;t been put down in the order in the first place). While my blue corn enchiladas were good, the egg portions were too bland really. I&#39;d be happy to go back there for brunch some day, but my first experience was less than perfect.

My boyfriend is from New Mexico, and since we moved to SF 2 years ago we haven&#39;t been able to find good New Mexican food - until tonight. I don&#39;t know how we didn&#39;t discover this place sooner. OH MY GOD. The food is perfect. Every single thing we had blew us away. The best thing is how you can vegetarianize almost every dish. I had the vegetarian green chili stew, which was a treat b/c it&#39;s usually impossible to find green chili stew without pork. We also had appetizer nachos, and guacamole, which was really fresh with the right amount of lime. Pacificos are $2. My one complaint about this place is I wish they had table servers, at least for dinner. It&#39;s so nice and cozy inside, but very awkward to stand in line and order at the counter. Counter service just doesn&#39;t match the warm, intimate feel of the place. But that&#39;s a small hangup. I&#39;m psyched to go back for breakfast burritos now.

Very disappointed. First of all service was horrible, this was my first time here and the young man was not very friendly even though I informed him it was my first time here. I ordered the flat enchilada with red chili sauce and pork which also had a scrambled egg in the middle? Really!! No fried eggs here. Cheese was barely melted and they were greedy with the red chili sauce which was quite tasty. Came with a tiny cup of what they refer to as green chili stew, horrible. Ordered an order if Sopapillas which were excellent however they were pricey, order of 4 @ $5. This is not a place to come if your looking for that real New Mexico taste- way over priced.

Very homemade taste and feel, plus a bottle of delicious organic chardonnay is $10!It can get really busy, so we went early and got a seat right away. We got 2 huge plates of food and a bottle of wine and got outta there barely over $30.Only thing that sucked: we ordered take out, and they gave us one teeny lil&#39; container of rice and beans (together), barely two bites each. But the food was still gooood. Rotisserie chicken = yum!

First off - this is not a place to get a burrito. Maybe a breakfast burrito, but not a Mission-stylee burrito, per se.This IS a spot to get yourself a healthy salad and a bowl of green chile or posole. I&#39;ve tasted green chile from New Mexico (Frontier Restaurant serves it ALL NIGHT LONG), and I&#39;ve been to Hatch, New Mexico and left with the scent of green chiles seeping from my pores. But that sort of green chile is the decadant, fatty sort, and Green Chile kitchen tends to cook up California-fied versions of the classic.I typically order a salad and a cup of the chile. The chile is served with a dollop of sour cream and a warm tortilla. The salad is crisp and garnished with cucumber, tomato and shredded carrots. While sometimes the service is annoyingly slow, the chile is tasty (though, if you&#39;re from New Mexico, you may find it a faint replica of the original) and the owners are really friendly. Also, the atmosphere here is clean and inviting - they serve both beer and wine, as well as organic sodas and Mexican Jarritas, and they also offer lovely jarfuls of ice water, real silverware and everything is served on tasteful Heath ceramics.So this place ends up somewhere between a restaurant and a take out sort of joint, and somewhere between a healthy California eating spot and a New Mexican outpost. Friday nights, there tend to be tons of families and lots of kids. Either way, when sitting at the bar in front of the window, there&#39;s a nice view of its Western Addition neighborhood, and on a sunny day, it&#39;s nice to take your chile outside and sit at one of the tables in the sun while reading the paper.I&#39;d say this is a good place for the &#39;hood, though not worth a trek by any means.Note: I don&#39;t know who M.S. is, but the above photos of Green Chile Kitchen are actually mine. Sort of funny to find them here.

I don&#39;t know why I keep coming, hoping to be wowed, but I think this was the last time. There&#39;s nothing actually wrong with the place. Other folks like it fine. But everything on the menu reminds me of chicken soup. It&#39;s all overcooked zucchini, watery tacos, and unremarkable spices. The roast pork is good, but it floats in a stew of boiled to death veggies. You find yourself praying for a bite with pork in it. Plus, everything is overpriced. 8 bucks for a bowl of guacamole and chips? Please! Call me crazy, but I recommend Little Chihuahua, the neighborhood&#39;s other Mexican place. It actually tastes Mexican.

I love this place. The green chile stew is to die for! It is a little spicy so watch out. They have a lot of vegetarian options, which is important because many of my friends are vegetarians and it is always nice to take them to a place where they can choose between more than one or two things. The people working there are very nice. Many of them remember my name even though I&#39;ve only been there a had full of times. Sure it costs a little more than a tacoria in the mission, but it&#39;s WAY nicer! Their ingredients are top quality, most of it is organic. They have nice bottles of wine sold for practically the same price as it is in the store, they have soju cocktails, and home made Kombucha tea on tap! Tell me that is not worth paying $8 for your burrito instead of $6.50.

When my order was recieved, there was a stack of orders about 15 deep, only one girl at the burrito assembly line and she looked overwhelmed. So she pulls our her blackberry, talks on the floor, then gets to work. Touches her hair, touches the tortillas...Eventually 3 more workers come out and assist, but they all looked confused at the ticket line-up. The burrito was bland, no green chile which I asked for.Both cashiers told me at different times &#34;its almost ready&#34; when it wasn&#39;t even being grilled. They were apologetic . Shoulda gone to Papalote

This is a nice little restaurant tucked away two blocks away from Divisadero. The food is Southwestern-style -- it&#39;s not the stuff you&#39;d actually be eating in Albuquerque or Santa Fe, but it&#39;s tasty in its own right.As the place gets busier, the speed of your order slows down. They aren&#39;t really geared to handle a flood of patrons, which happens once or twice a week. On those days, your burrito will be later. Tasty, but late.The people who work there are very nice and personable. Then again, we live in the neighborhood, so that may be why. I&#39;ve always felt well looked-after, in any case.

I am also a firm believer that all mexican and new mexican food should be reasonably priced. we paid over $20 for just a bowl of soup and the enchilada plate. that wouldn&#39;t happen in new mexico.super disappointing, we were looking forward to eating here bc of all the yelp reviews.chili pies (their dessert place) down the street is pretty awesome!

UPDATE: 08/29/07; Four starsWe came back last week and sat in the restaurant and had their &#34;plates&#34;. They were very good. I had the cheese tamales. My husband had the chicken enchilada. But the favorite of the night was the combo plate, and the favorite of the combos was the taco! Great food. We&#39;ll be back!___________________________Old review:3.5 stars.I didn&#39;t realize that this place was semi-fancy, sit down Mexican food. We ordered take out Wednesday night, right before watching the 2 hour season finale of LOST. (Which by the way was MUCH better than the season finale of Heroes.)They have paper menus at the counter in the back where you order, and also a chalkboard of specials for that night. I ordered a chicken burrito with red chili sauce and a veggie burrito with red chili sauce.The orders come out slower than your neighborhood Mexican joint, and came with blue corn chips and green salsa, which tasted kinda sweet.The burritos themselves tasted &#34;clean&#34;, if you know what I mean. Not your typical, greasy Mexican food, which I expected. The red chili sauce was spicy, but of course, I could have used more spice, I&#39;m Korean. We&#39;re spicy like that.Up at the front counter, they&#39;ve got pints of Ciao Bella gelato and natural sodas. I need to go back one of these days and have a sit down meal and try one of their &#34;plates&#34;.$14.00: two burritos, tax and tip.

Good food at a good price. We will definitely be back. My wife had the taco salad and I had the chicken burrito with the red chile, both of which were excellent.

Yum! This is by far one of my favorites in the city. As I usually put it, it&#39;s non-greasy, non-lardy, but oh-so-delicious Mexican food (or New Mexican if you want to get picky).The food is incredibly fresh. My favorite is the tamales and their soup is fantastic too. The chicken dinner is unbelievable too and if you&#39;re not in the mood for traditional Mexican, it&#39;s the perfect choice (definitely get the mashed potato side dish). The prices are reasonable too.Unfortunately, I can only give them 4 stars. I&#39;ve tried their breakfast burritos twice now and they made me nauseous both times. All of my friends love them though so it might just be my picky stomach.The place can get pretty crowded though, so I usually grab it to-go. One of the perks is curbside pick up. You can call ahead and then wait outside in your car and they bring it out (yes, I&#39;m THAT lazy).

I ate here once, I&#39;d have eaten there more due to convenience but the food just wasn&#39;t all that. Its yet another dripping-wet-hipster-taco place, just like Papalote up the street.They also didn&#39;t pay attention to my order very well because I got cheese on one of my items and I told them &#34;I am allergic to dairy, no cheese/creme/etc please&#34;.

The change of location for Green Chile Kitchen (GCK) is the best thing that could of happened to this authentic organic Mexican restaurant located in Alamo Square area. Looking for a casual yet comforting ambiance, GCK is your place! EVERYTHING is delicious here, including the all-star breakfast burritos that are the perfect cure to a killer hangover. This has quickly become a favorite w/ my group of friends and is always crowded but there&#39;s plenty of seating. The taco salad is fresh with ingredients and has the best California avocados. Whether your a neighborhood regular or just a visitor to the neighborhood, this is MUST-HAVE!

I&#39;ve had the burritos at dinnertime, which didn&#39;t really impress me - I&#39;d rather go to Papalote or La Taqueria if I want a burrito.However, the nachos are pretty good - and the breakfast burritos are huge and so good.I&#39;ll keep trying them - maybe at some point, I will like their burritos.

It&#39;s not the Mission like everyone says, but damn those jalapeno mashed potatoes make me happy.And it&#39;s all organic.And they don&#39;t skimp on portions.And beer is cheap. They serve beer AND wine!It&#39;s great for friends, dates and families.The steak burrito is definitely a must have. It&#39;s not the cheapest, but it&#39;s worth it.It&#39;s not a gut bomb, so if youre looking for an &#34;after too many margaritas and mayhem meal&#34;, this ain&#39;t your place. It&#39;s fresh, quaint and just so damn tasty. Their guac is chunky and flavorful. Their meats have character, but aren&#39;t too intensely spicy. Although I do like me some spicy beef....You can even get half a rotisserie chicken if you think you can handle it. Is your belly ready for the jalapeno jelly?

It&#39;s been awhile since I ate here, but I remember quite a bit about it.I loved how they use mason jars instead of cups. I may be a bit biased since I like mason jars in general, but they were so unique.I got a burrito (carne asada?) and I remember that chile honey was on every table and that it complemented the flavors of my burrito. I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s how I was supposed to eat it, but it was delicious that way. The burrito was served unconventionally drizzled with a green chile sauce that required a knife and fork to eat it. It was rather irritating, to be honest. I want to eat my burrito like a burrito! Also, I think the tortilla was too large because it was all bunched together on one side. My burrito was a snugly wrapped bundle, but the excess of tortilla was a bit of a turn off.I really liked the aesthetic details of the restaurant; the sleek dark gray/black square plates were a nice touch, the lights were slightly dimmed and like I said before, they used mason jars. Overall, a very nice restaurant, but it almost seems to value visuals over functionality.

I was in an incredibly pissy mood prior to walking into this happy little place. I&#39;d been stuck in stupid traffic and had to pee for over an hour then had to try and park on Divisidero.The cute blonde behind the counter said the magic words &#34;yes, we have a bathroom&#34; and I was already stoked. Was even more stoked when my yummy blue corn tacos came out a few minutes later. Totally and completely pleased a short while later when I finished them. Nummy nummy in da tummy.Kind of a yuppified southwestern place with black beans and green chile on the menu but it was really tasty, affordable food in a pleasant little place.Kinda funny that the girl behind the counter was white, while the cooks were all hispanic.

Let&#39;s just say that if this restaurant was located in Santa Fe or Albuquerque it wouldn&#39;t be in business for long.My boyfriend and I have been excited to try this place for some time as we&#39;re both huge fans of green chiles and southwestern food in general. We ordered the veggie burrito with christmas sauce and the veggie green chile stew.The stew was pretty decent but it was lukewarm and the small size wasn&#39;t worth the price. The burrito was mostly filled with rice and was lukewarm as well. I was really hoping the red and green chile sauce would be enough to make up for the lame burrito, but I&#39;ve had better sauce from a jar.If this place was in my neighborhood I would maybe go back for the chile stew if I had a sudden craving for it, but since it&#39;s not in my hood, I won&#39;t be going back anytime soon.

Perhaps not the best place to go for a regular ole run of the mill burrito, but still hella fancy. Green Chile Kitchen&#39;s best option is definitely the breakfast burrito though, if&#39;n you&#39;re not vegan. Oh god so good. They also serve unsweetened yerba mate tea, and that makes me happy more than anything.

I love New Mexico and its food, and not just because of Breaking Bad. My pal &amp; I bellied up to the bar &amp; were served beer tastes while we waited for our food. The servers were super friendly and the food was all delicious! I agree with the writer who called out the sopapillas for some help -- I prefer mine doughier -- but what a great addition to San Francisco&#39;s options for casual food!

Hmmm. I really wanted to like this place as I am a huge fan of Santa Fe food. I just got home from eating the chicken enchilada plate and while it was tasty, it was also sort of mealy and weird, and the red sauce wasn&#39;t all deep and haunting like I want a red sauce to be, and the chips were overly foo foo.I really like the staff and the interior a lot, and they had $2 Pacificos, so I&#39;ll probably go back, but it&#39;s not that exciting, foodwise.

Let me start by saying I lived in Colorado for a few years, and my wifes family lives in Santa Fe, so I know what green chile/New Mexico style Mexican cuisine should be. This ain&#39;t it.What a dissapointment. I guess after reading the reviews I wasn&#39;t expecting a whole lot, but was hoping for more than I got. I ordered the Pork something or other burrito which I have to say was the worst burrito I&#39;ve had maybe, ever. I can&#39;t believe a restaurant in SF would serve pork like that. Not at ALL tender, yet still overcooked. It seemed like they just threw some pieces of pork and cooked it real quick. Terrible. There was also very little inside the burrito, just a lot of tortilla. Also, potatoes in a burrito? Really? I made the mistake of getting it Christmas style (1/2 red 1/2 green chile) which also ended up costing an extra $1. I say it was a mistake because the green chile was actually decent, but they already barely put enough on and then the other half was what was supposed to be red chile, but sure looked (and tasted) like canned enchilada sauce to me. I think this place just thinks that because they are serving green chile they can forget about the rest? Oh well. The sopapillas were decent, as was the sangria. Definitely won&#39;t be back. Bummer

Nachos are my favorite junk food and Green Chile has some of THE best nachos I&#39;ve ever had. I ordered the appetizer size and it was enough to fill me up for dinner.I was eying our neighbor&#39;s plates...there portions were huge and looked delicious...I wanted to steal a bite!Definitely a delicious and affordable place to eat out when you want some good home cooked mexican food.

If you have ever been to Tomasita&#39;s in Santa Fe, NM then DO NOT BOTHER GOING HERE. If you have lived in New Mexico and miss tender burritos packed with beans and swimming in a spicy vegetal gravy of savory green chile, then I repeat: don&#39;t bother.Because what you get is a soupy concoction of soggy tortilla wrapped around cheese and beans, covered in cheese, and surrounded by cheese. Even if you order extra green chile and NO CHEESE, they will still serve you a tortilla log in a greasy pool of cheese.The search continues.

Food is pretty good, but you will wait for it- even at slow times.The staff can be inattentive and definitely focused on themselves, rather than the customers.I do appreciate the organic ingredients, and the made to order dishes, but it really can take 20 minutes for a burrito.

This is my favorite place to eat! The food is excellent (order the mexican burrito plate or one of the salads - you won&#39;t be disappointed). The atmosphere is casual and I like that this is a place you can go, order at the bar and just sit wherever you like. It has a nice ambiance. They could, however, dim the lights a little more at night.. They were pretty bright when I went. The water is self serve with small mason jars which I thought was a nice touch. All in all a great place to dine alone, with friends or on a date.

The burritos here are sooooo good! The best burritos I&#39;ve had in SF since I moved here. Breakfast burrito = super soft tortilla filled with just the right ratio of eggs, potatoes, cheese, and soyrizo (or whatever meat you want)...then topped with warm red or green sauce. Yowza! I got tofu tacos once and they tasted like nothing. I&#39;ll stick to the burritos from now on.

Every time I go here I have trouble picking what I want...and it&#39;s not cause there&#39;s nothing good on the menu. For dinner, I usually end up with the 1/4 chicken all white meat dinner. It comes with Fulton Valley rotisserie chicken, rice, beans, mashed potatoes and tortillas for $9.50. Seriously good. Salads, enchiladas, and burritos are also great and generously portioned, and Pacifico is always $2.

They moved to a new location last year which is great because there is usually always room to sit. I have had their burritos, their nachos, and their salads. I have been pleased with them. I think it is a little overpriced, hence the 4 stars.

Until last week, I have never been here. Now, I am a complete fan of the food.For me, Mexican food is very hit or miss. While I really LOVE Mexican food, if its done wrong, it can be too heavy, too greasy, not enough grease to hit the spot, or just a miss. So everytime I go into a new Mexican restaurant I haven&#39;t tried, I go in with the hesitation, or fear that the food won&#39;t hit the spot completely. Combine that with the initial thought that this was going to be a taqueria of some sorts, which around the south bay are a dime a dozen, you may or may not be completely excited to eat.Man, I was wrong to go into this place with that perception. The food is awesome, actually, let me say that it was amazing. A lot of reviews have said that all the food has just the right amount of ingriedients - and I have to completely agree. And the best part, not only did the food hit the spot, it did not make me feel heavy or guilty...two common feelings that plague you when you eat at a Mexican joint.So, what do you come for? The steak burrito with the green chile. It is just AWESOME. Throw in the $2 bottle of pacifico and you have yourself a great meal (BTW the beer is $2 all the time!). Another plus, the food is decently priced and you get a good amount.For all you fans of great food, this is definitely a place to stop by and check out. You will most likely, become a fan and begin to crave the steak burrito bowl with green chile. And yes, maybe even a bottle of pacifico.

What is that old saying, fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me. Well what do you know, I have now been fooled twice three months apart from each other. I am so bummed out. Let me just say for 10.90$ I feel like I should be able to expect to get what I want in my burrito. I have twice ordered super burritos WITHOUT rice and received it. Do they need to translate rice to arroz or do I need to open my burrito &#34;to go&#34; in the restaurant and bite into it so that I know I am getting what I paid for.The exuberant prices can be explained with the territory, as there are many USF students(=$$$) and middle class families with appetites and the wallet to match. For this reason I cannot bash on the prices. Unfortunately burrito joints in this vicinity have taken advantage of the high socioeconomic status of its most prevalent residents and I am not one of them (I know, I know, the recession...).Don&#39;t worry, I will solve my dissonance via this blog and by not ever going back. I hope someone is reading this and takes my advice. There is such a nasty taste that one is left with when not getting what they were unsure of paying for in the first place. Good luck my fellow blog readers...

The breakfast burritos are the bomb especially when satisfying the grease craving after a night of boozing. The habinaro salsa is super hot and delicious. The new location is great, much larger, with a nice big community table. The chicken dinners are also a great deal and yummy as well. At times it can be pretty crowded, so call in your take out order to avoid a wait.

Maybe i should be more generous, as the wait staff were pleasant enough and there was nothing actually bad about the food, but the problem was simply that both the posole and the green chile stew tasted almost the same, the only serious difference being the hominy in the posole.I&#39;d have been much happier if i hadn&#39;t known what a real posole and a real Chile Verde were supposed to taste like.

Green Chile Kitchen is a block from my house and I LOVE it. I am so happy that they use sustainable, non-antibiotic meats. The steak burrito is delicious and I get it &#39;naked&#39; without the tortilla and it&#39;s even better. The rotisserie chicken dinner is also wonderful and I just tried their tacos with ground beef and was super impressed. Check it out!!

This is NOT Mexican food or Tex Mex. This is wonderful Southwestern food. Their posole and green chile stew are as good if not better than what I used to have in New Mexico and I say better because of the quality of ingredients that go into their food from Fulton Valley Chicken to Niman Ranch Pork and Beef.

green chile kitchen has the best grilled chicken in the city. i&#39;m serious. whether you get a whole meal or just a chicken burrito, you will not be disappointed with the flavor. the fulton valley chicken is always tender and features subtle touches of spice and chile flavor. i don&#39;t even live in NOPA anymore, but find myself going back for this hidden gem.here are some tips to help out your dining experience:- the chicken comes with different flavor rubs. try them out if you&#39;re feeling adventurous.- this place is rather small and can get packed with families with young kids (probably because of the natural ingredients). i always call ahead and get my food to go in order to avoid the screaming babies. i rarely have to deal with kids in the city and i like to keep it that way.- the breakfast burritos are also excellent here. soyrizo anyone?

Great food and horrifically bad service about sums up Green Chile Kitchen. I walked in at 12:15 pm and the register was completely unmanned. Prospective customers were confused and the prep cooks who saw what was going on just stared lazily past us without telling the cashier to get the heck out front. During the lunch rush? Seriously?! They are also slow as molasses at filling orders and habitually screw up uncomplicated requests. The only reason I even bother to return to GCK is that I really, really love the food, even if it is regularly served with a side of incompetence. They use quality product - organic vegetables, Fulton Farms chicken, Niman Ranch beef, brown rice (at a Southwestern restaurant!) - and the housemade chile sauces are fabulous. It&#39;s comfort food that I can also feel good about putting into my body. Here&#39;s hoping the ownership reads this review and starts hiring some more, ahem, motivated waitstaff.

I&#39;m kind of less impressed with Green Chile every time I go. I&#39;ve had the nachos (too dry!), tamales (not amazing, but my favorite thing here. Good flavors on a generously portioned plate), chips (not salty enough for me, but I appreciate the blue corn tortillas - Yummy!), guacamole (not too bad), wet burritos (good and smoky, but not what I look for when I personally get a burrito craving). The atmosphere is nice, and it&#39;s a good place to go with friends. Overall, an okay place to grab a bite.

So after an emergency at work led me to closing the store when I otherwise had a sun filled day off, my bosses brought a beer by for me and offered to bring me a burrito from this new place they had heard about that specialized in New Mexican fare.Awesome. Dinner on my bosses tab. I continue to work, alone, subtly drinking my Red Stripe behind the counter when a strange french man in his 40&#39;s comes in and begins to harass me. I won&#39;t go into detail but I was seconds away from dialing the cops when he ceased asking me things like if I was alone, and what my name was, the quickest fake name I could come to was Melissa, and the bastard finally leaves. I&#39;m now freaked out, exhausted and slightly sad my day is ending in such a way and am pleased that the highlight will be the burrito the bosses promised. All I can do to not feel freaked out is hope that they get here quickly, with the food.This burrito DID NOT make up for the weird day my Saturday had become. I took it home with me and ate it alone thinking, why does this taste familiar? And then it clicked. It tastes like food my grandma makes when she, whom is not Mexican nor New- Mexican but learned how to cook AMAZING Mexican food from her mother-in-law, is too tired to cook. Rice, beans some meat tomatoes. Only seasoning, maybe salt.So disappointed. A horrible end to my horrible evening. I ate the whole thing reluctantly because I wanted to like it, it was free dammit. The rice was a weird texture, green chili&#39;s in the burrito a great idea but didn&#39;t stand out or say anything spectacular or stellar to my taste buds. The meat was of course the best thing in the whole compilation. I wondered if plates would be better, enchiladas etc. But this morning find out from the boss that even the plate she ordered was lame.Wonderful idea this place is, horrible execution. As a native San Franciscan, of part Mexican decent who was just searching for some comfort food after a VERY odd day, a tear came to my eyes. I should have just heated a tortilla directly on the burner of my gas stove, made some frijoles and called it a night.

Everything is amazing at the Green Chile Kitchen. It&#39;s definitely one of my favorite spots in the city. A couple of pointers- 1. watch how much you order- it can $ add up fast. 2. Make sure you mention that you want NO avocado on your taco (if you are allergic). 3. Be prepared to wait around for a seat or take it to go. And then get ready to eat some yummy down home food!

Updated October 22, 2007***Green Chile Kitchen has a formula that really works. There is no table service so you don&#39;t have to worry about cranky waiters. You order your food at the counter and then they bring it out to you. They have burritos, tacos, rotisserie chicken, and more. All the meat is organic and free range. It&#39;s listed as Mexican and I&#39;ve heard it described as Santa Fe but be careful if you call it Tex-Mex. I don&#39;t know what to call it but yummy.I just ate a half of a chicken with herbed citrus rub, roasted potatoes with cheese, and a green salad. I could have eaten a whole bowl of just that delicious, crispy chicken skin but that might have been gross. Now I&#39;m in food coma. Oh my. When I snap out of it I&#39;ll rewrite this review in a more eloquent manner. For now it shall just be, &#34;Hunter like meat. Meat good.&#34;OK, so this wasn&#39;t one of my best reviews but doggonit, people like me... I think.***Now that I have an iPhone (yes ladies, I have an iPhone) I can yelpimmediately from the restaurant I&#39;m eating at and if they have wifi Ican upload my review right away. Boy do I feel like a geek. No wonderI&#39;m still single. And if you don&#39;t already feel sorry for me, how&#39;sthis? The last two places I went to I was completely alone. I&#39;m notjust talking about going by myself, I was the only person in theplace. Read my Madrone review.So anyway, the update. Finally GCK has breakfast burritos. They evenhave a sign out front that says, &#34;Finally Breakfast Burritos.&#34; I had asuper with chorizo. Great way to fill your belly early on the morningand go back home for a nap. No need to sign a waiting list out front.No scrambling for a table either. You get your food right away becauseyou are the only person in the restaurant. The sun shines through thewindow and halfway across your table. Little Maria comes in lookingfor her mom and the counter guy tells HER what salsa is for. Your foodsettles in your stomach and then you go to Central Coffee for anespresso. There will be people there so you won&#39;t be alone.

I lived in New Mexico for 10 years and I have missed green chile since I left 5 years ago. This IS the ONLY place you can get it outside of New Mex and it is very very good. My favorite is the green chile stew with chicken.However minus a star because the size of the stew (especially to go) is just too small. Also, they need to have a separate line for to go customers. I have yet to see the curbside pick up work.The food is the BOMB!!

Great food, and as another yelper stated, it was the smell that grabbed my attention and caused me to stop my walk for some food. I&#39;ve been back four times since.The food is great, the menu is simple, not bad on prices, super service, and they have one of the greatest drink selections in the area. Organic if that&#39;s your thing, Pacifico beer is always below happy hour price, and many natural sodas and wines. Plus, the place is very clean!Meats are free-range too!

Came here for the first time last night with my fiance and our two friends. They just moved around the corner, so we decided to grab a bite from a local grub spot. SO GLAD we came across this place. Very clean inside and the service is incredible. Every employee there had a smile on their face, and were clearly excited to serve you (which is rare nowadays). There was no wait, so we walked right up to the counter and placed our order. I ordered the Stuffed Sopaipillas with Carne Adovada (red chile pork) and a margarita. We didn&#39;t have to wait long for our food, and they brought it right to our table- still steaming, which is always a good sign. And normally I don&#39;t really care how my food is presented, as long as its good...but, the first thing WE ALL noticed when our plates came was how perfectly placed everything was on the plate, even the refried beans were in a perfect little pile, and not &#34;slopped&#34; all over the place. I was very impressed. And the icing on the cake: it was probably the best Mexican food I&#39;ve ever had. I usually can&#39;t eat much (ie: one taco and a few bites of rice and I&#39;m stuffed), but I cleared my plate and probably could have licked it clean. If you&#39;re in the area, I highly recommend this modern, cafe-style Mexican joint. It&#39;s small, but there are plenty of places to sit and the service is outstanding. I&#39;m definitely coming back!!

having lived in the land of green chilie (Santa Fe [Tesuque to be exact]), I really don&#39;t see what all the hype is about this place! They do skimp on the green chilies in their dishes. And when I asked for Christmas they looked at me like I was crazy (that&#39;s red and green chilie together). While I can detect that o-so familiar and intoxicating flavor of green chilies in the food, it&#39;s underwhelming at best. It&#39;s certainly no Tecolote, Pasquals or Plaza Restaurant. When in Santa Fe these places are a MUST. Be sure and ask for Christmas to get the full spectrum of dynamic chilie flavor.

Just got back from Santa Fe and was needing my fix of all things New Mex. Then I realized my fave local spot IS New Mex cuisine and it&#39;s dang good. I love the local vibe and the super friendly service. It&#39;s one step above feeling like a taqueria, which is refreshing in this city. Cheap beer and some Christmas (red and green chili) style anything and I&#39;m one happy girl.

I LOVE Green Chile Kitchen. Its right down the street from my house and anytime I walk by it I start salivating.The food is delicious and the people are super friendly. True its a little pricey but I talked to the owner one day and found out that its because they support organic farms. I&#39;ll pay a little extra for better quality any day.If you havent checked this place out, do it. You wont be sorry. My favorite is the super chicken burrito. Get both the red and green sauce on it. Delicious!Now I&#39;m hungry.

I have some friends from Texas who are always talking about breakfast tacos (and bitching about how you can&#39;t get them in SF). Well, compadres, I&#39;ve found your breakfast tacos.Jonesin for some bacon and eggs, I hopped on over this morning. I was alone and didn&#39;t really want a full-on sit down experience, but wanted some quality fare. GCK only uses high quality ingredients which I believe are all local (Niman Ranch, for one). The salsas are fantastic- not some store-bought version from a jar. But back to the tacos.The eggs were light and fluffy, the pico de gallo crisp and the tortillas, well, corny. Having had &#39;authentic&#39; bfast tacos not too long ago in Austin, I have to say these were just as good- just in a higher-quality way (i.e. not the down-and-dirty kind from Texas). Buen provecho.

It&#39;s right next to my house, and the smell makes me want a burrito every time I get home. I&#39;ve eaten here several times and found their New Mexican inspired food way better than actual New Mexican food in New Mexico. The ingredients are fresh and they often have good deals on breakfast burritos. Come by here if you&#39;re in the neighborhood, it&#39;s not too pricey and it has pretty fast food turnaround.

Having lived in New Mexico for 9 years, we&#39;ve been yearning for some good New Mexican food, so we had high hopes for Green Chile Kitchen. It didn&#39;t disappoint. We all had burritos, which were delicious. The ingredients were really good quality and portion size was good. The biggest disappointment is that we were there at 3 in the afternoon, and they don&#39;t start serving sopaipillas until 5 PM.

Ever since Whole Foods switched to the &#34;make your own burrito&#34; bar, I&#39;ve been looking for a place that serves up the grubbin mexican food I crave, using organic veggies and quality meat.Last night I got the salad with meat, like they do it at Pluto&#39;s, but paid twice as much. Don&#39;t care, it&#39;s in my hood and the gucamole was delish. Burritos are goodbut not the biggest super burrito you ever saw. (Baby-sized burritos are so 90s any way!)Pretty good service, they have beer and wine, and the ambiance is nice. Four stars are for the food and my gratitude that the restaurant options might finally be expanding in the panhandle!

Great spot for take out dinner. The rotisserie chicken was very tasty. Minus one star because they packed the take out bag so full that all of the house made salsas that I purchased went flying off the top of my takeout boxes and smashed open on the ground.

Green Chile is one of my favorite mexican restaurants in the City. It&#39;s New Mexican style Mexican cuisine, which I&#39;m told makes a difference. In any case, it&#39;s delicious. They hold the title of &#34;Best Breakfast Burrito EVAR!&#34; Which is true. So go get one, with green sauce and bacon.Other than breakfast, they have a huge menu with many different options, such as layered enchiladas, burritos, stews, salads and tamales. I&#39;m probably leaving something out. They use Niman Ranch beef and pork and Fulton Valley chicken, and use local ingredients whenever they can. They also have rotisserie chickens, so on a lazy night you can come by and get 1/4, 1/2 or whole chicken with either their green chile or citrus rub.They have two sauces. One is green, one is red. The red is ok, but it has a seriously smokey flavor. Maybe you like that, but I think the green is the best. You can get the green spicier, too.I can&#39;t recommend these guys enough. I love them.

What a treat! I can&#39;t tell you the countless times I&#39;ve driven past this place and said to myself, &#34;I should really check it out&#34;. Well, I regret it took so long to go in because I think I&#39;ve found my new obssssion! I knew I wanted to save room for dessert so I went light with their Beet Salad with Chicken &amp; Avo. Delicious! But the mouthwatering part came after we walked down the block to its sister, &#34;Chili Pies&#34; and order the Mexican Chocolate Pecan apiece with Three Twins Maple Walnut Icecream. Holy cow! I&#39;ve already made plans to go with friends on Tuesday!!!

Whenever super nachos are offered on any menu, you must always get them. Why would you want rice, beans, even mashed potatoes on the side of your rotisserie chicken when you can have nachos? Everything I tried was good, especially the posole. Since it&#39;s in Aaron&#39;s hood and he intro&#39;ed me to the place, I think I can safely say Green Chile Kitchen, mmmmmmmmmm!!!!!

greenchilekitchen-I had the beef taco. It was made with Neiman Ranch beef. Unfortunately, it didn&#39;t taste like Neiman. Although I had the good-for-you feeling that I was eating better quality beef, I didn&#39;t get the full benefit of eating it freshly grilled. The beef was pre cooked and in a broth, tasted like chipped beef or beef stew meat. If I went to a steak house featuring Neiman Ranch steaks, then I wouldn&#39;t want them to cook my steak before I arrived. Anyway, the taco had a nice red chile with an earthy flavor to it, along with lettuce. I gave the taco 3 out of 5. The 3 was a stretch. The green salsa in the little cup was too acidic. I was so disappointed given the idea behind the name (greenchilekitchen).Here is what I really like about the place. They have rotisserie chicken, although it wasn&#39;t spinning, I&#39;ll go back to try it with a glass of fine wine, since they have a nice selection. Did I mention that I really like the decor? It&#39;s very very inviting and I want to stay there for hours. Oh yeah, they have wireless internet. No way! Way! The customers are nice; it feels like I&#39;m shopping at TJ&#39;s, Berkeley Bowl or Whole Foods.

I love you Green Chile, but you&#39;ve been slipping. I haven&#39;t visited in a while, but when I did, I was expecting an amazing burrito. What I got was something mediocre. Please fully grill those burritos! I will patiently wait because it&#39;s better than the disappointment you feel when the cheese is completely not melted.

This place reminds me of a cross between San Antonio tex mex and the chiles my grandma used to cook from New Mexico. A lot of the flavors are smokey and sweet. The beans are a bit bland, but if you just add one of the salsas your good to go. My bi-monthly dinner consists of the green chile enchiladas and a Butte Creek Pils. Butte Creek is a local brewery, hailing out of Chico where I spent five years of my life drinking this magic in a bottle. It pairs great with the stew as well. The nachos are filled with a large amount of toppings and definitely worth sharing with the table. I like to go midweek early evening when it&#39;s not as busy.

So happy with this place. Great food, and one of the few that serves good calabacitas.Went last night, and was given the wrong burrito as part of a to go order. Made it outside and the young man ran out after us to tell us he had put in a chicken burrito rather than a vegetarian burrito. Was super happy he came out after us, and took care of it, rather than me having to return. Great service!

I really enjoyed this restaurant, so did my boyfriend who is the pickiest eater on the planet.My sister moved to Albuquerque, NM about a year ago and the two times I&#39;ve been to visit I could not get enough of the New Mexican food. Everything is super spicy and smothered with New Mexico chiles (red or green).Now, I wondered if a New Mexican restaurant in San Francisco could do justice to this amazing food... I just have to say that I found Green Chile Kitchen to be amazing. And the food actually reminded me of a restaurant in Albuquerque, called El Patio.Most places in NM give you giant portions, but this place has the food but in a portion that just filled me up, so I didn&#39;t overeat. I acutally liked the portion size a lot.The chiles, which I get cravings for and are very hard to find in CA were just as good as most that you find in NM!This place made me sosososo happy that I can get my chile fix and not have to fly all the way to ABQ. YAY!

I&#39;ve been here once and I really want to go back. This is strange because I usually don&#39;t go for Americanized Mexican food but I guess this is New Mexican food. To compare it to traditional Mexican food would be unfair.I had the New Mexican chicken enchilada and it was delicious but very different than a traditional enchilada. The tortillas are layered between cheese, sauce, and roasted chicken (local, range-fed) before being baked to an ideal consistency. I ordered mine with red sauce but they offer green sauce or &#34;Christmas&#34; (both red and green).The chips and salsa were also great. I asked for an extra hot sauce and they actually have a wonderful habanero salsa -- this is truly a rarity at such non-traditional, yuppie Mexican places.

This eatery is a welcome addition to the North Panhandle neighborhood, especially with the demise of the oft-criticized Tango 20! burrito place further down Fulton. While the prices suggest gentification more than the food does, the chicken, burritos, and salads are tasty. The staff asked us how are food was and seemed genuinely interested (to the point of nervousness) about whether we enjoyed the food.The food is good and the location is very convenient, serving a neighborhood that should have twice as many places to eat as it does.

Green Chili Kitchen might as well be called Vegas Burrito. Your chances of getting a stellar vs. awful burrito are roughly equivalent. When it&#39;s stellar, highlights are the shredded pork super burrito with remarkable guacamole. When it&#39;s awful, it&#39;s signified by egregious errors such as running out of black beans.(NOTE to Owner/Head-buyer/head chef: You&#39;re a burrito place. Black beans in your burritos are integral to your business model. Please plan accordingly.)Additionally, disorganization tends to reign supreme here. The line/ordering set up changes more than Puff Daddy&#39;s name, the divvying-up of employee tasks appears to be governed by musical-chairs and I&#39;ve often found myself a block out the door before I&#39;m run down by an out-of-breath employee explaining that he gave me the wrong take-out order.Bottomline: Green Chile is new, so clearly a few kinks are still being ironed out. Potential is staggering. However, at the moment a burrito at Green Chili is like betting the house on red at the Bellagio roulette table --- you&#39;re either going to win big or feel like a jackass.

Taste and value. The chickens are roasted with lots of love, this is evident in a simple soft taco that was loaded with juicy white meat. Burrito was top-notch (with green chile on top of course). The rice, beans, are so flavorful, even the tamale was extraordinarily packed with comforting flavors. A great find tucked away in the neighborhood! Go on off-hours to ensure a seat.

The enchiladas and tacos were good although my food always got cold really fast (I only ordered to go).The owner, Trevor, yelp-mailed me 1 year ago and asked me to try the place again. I was a little put-off at that time because he assumed I hadn&#39;t lived in the area long enough to know that Green Chile Kitchen came before Papalote. Six months after his email, I went back and tried it and liked it. I had made it a regular place, but on my last day living in the neighborhood my tired husband and I went there for take out. We stood in line for 30 minutes and then waited for our food for 30 minutes. We only got our food at that point because I asked about it and the cashier practically threw it at me. I rarely take 1 hour to eat even when I go somewhere for a sit down meal.Trevor, I don&#39;t know if you are still the owner of Green Chile. If you are, don&#39;t bother emailing me again. I will NOT change my review.

Since this place has opened up, I can&#39;t stop eating there. At reasonable prices, the food they offer gives a upscale take on my favorite type of food without going over the top. Their blue corn tortilla chips with the simple, yet sufficient, selection of salsa adds as a great side to my favorite: THE CHICKEN SUPER BURRITO: CHRISTMAS STYLE.The employees are extremely nice and helpful, but the service is very slow. I&#39;ve seen some improvements recently, with he addition of a computerized ordering system, but even during the smallest of rushes, they seem understaffed. Hasn&#39;t stopped me yet, though!

I love rotisserie chicken. I love when it is juicy, flavorful and falls apart at the touch of your fingers (yes, I am a picker). There should be no need for a knife when eating r.c. If you&#39;re looking for a r.c. option beyond Safeway, Andronicos, Falletti&#39;s, Costco, etc - try this cute little place with a Mexican flare. I&#39;ve only tried their r.c. once - along with pork tamales, guacamole and sauted veggies - and I&#39;m definitely willing to give it another try. Perhaps, I&#39;ll eat in next time. The nice part of about taking out was how I was able to order as I was leaving work, pay over the phone, cab over to the not-so-busy corner of Fulton and Baker, run in and run out (with food in tow). Nice, quick, yummy and a feeling of &#34;gourmet-ness.&#34;

3 stars from my boyfriend who loves their quesadilla (i just butchered the spelling didn&#39;t I?) and -1 star from me.my guy really likes this place, it&#39;s in our neighborhood, it&#39;s good quality food and for someone that eats chicken, it&#39;s pretty darn good. No mission burrito.....but still great for the neighborhood.I on the other hand have quite a different experience with this place. I think it&#39;s got great decor, I love that something like this is in the neighborhood and the people that work there are very nice and helpful and attentive. I totally want to support this small business but......1) I got food poisoning the first few months they opened from the veggie burrito. 24hrs of throwing up. And it was everything I ate there.Because of this experience, I could never go back. My body would get sick at the idea of it, even when i would stop in for a drink to go. So after year(s)? of convincing, my guy says &#34;c&#39;mon that was so long ago.... try it again, you&#39;ll like it.&#34;So we go in, I decide to get the blue corn cheese enchiladas. I&#39;m excited, it smells good and then I go to cut my enchilada&#39;s and I need a fucking axe to cut through the tortilla. I don&#39;t know if blue corn is suppose to be this tough, but it was ridiculous and it just felt undercooked. I mean, you can&#39;t really get melted cheese and sauce wrong so the tortilla is really where its at to pull it all together. So to make the best of it I start mixing my rice with the cheese and sauce instead...... the rice was from the bottom of the pan and I about crack a tooth chomping on gristly rice. FUN!the chocolate chip cookies are good (if they had been warm). I later found out they bake their chocolate chip cookies IN THE ROTISSERIE!!!! So vegetarians, be warned!!!!

I was considering giving GCK four stars for diplomacy, but when it comes down to it, this restaurant serves the tastiest burritos I&#39;ve had in San Francisco. In fact, one of the perks of recently having moved back to Western Addition is being closer to this spot. High quality, mostly sustainable ingredients make not only for great taste but also guilt-free dining and good value. Their posole is delicious, the home-roasted chicken is outstanding, and their breakfast burritos brighten my weekend mornings. Several months ago I noticed a lag in service and that the tables were not being bussed quickly enough; however, that issue seems to have been remedied. As far as inexpensive yet atmospheric neighborhood dining goes, GCK is as good as it gets.

Surprisingly good. Not something I would expect from a place I had never heard of, but really enjoyed my enchiladas and my posole. Great flavors and nice spice to everything. Very family friendly, noticed a lot of kids around. $2 Pacificos anyone?

the food is really good. since i have been a veggie for the past year this place fits the bill for good vegie alternatives.but, i can not understand why it is so packed other than lack of competition in the area for mex food. people think they found the end all be all of mexican food but it is just good. now add in the long lines and it moves down a bit on how great it is. but i can walk there so i put up with it which is i guess what everyone else does.

Yeah, I was staying at the building adjacent to this place and had to force myself not come in here everyday. The Chorizo Burritos are rediculous. 2$ Pacifico Beer. AND their Breakfast burrito is offered till 12:00 on the weekday.

I love curbside delivery service! So nice not to have to find parking when you&#39;re solo. Got the posole the other night and it was pretty good. Interested in trying more items. With the convenience of curbside delivery I definitely will. :-)

This is our local burrito joint, owned by the friend of a friend&#39;s family, more&#39;s the pity. The food is good, we have eaten here many times. But this is the last time. Tonight we waited over an hour for 4 burritos. Called in a take out order, were told 15 minutes, went in, waited an hour, and finally found the bag of our food waiting, lost and forgotten, on a side table. Had been sitting there a while. Sigh. you lose, green chili kitchen, and so do we.

I ordered a chicken quesadilla from Green Chile Kitchen. When I got home I had a steak quesadilla. This is not the first time they gave me steak instead of chicken. I don&#39;t like steak. That&#39;s why I order chicken.I&#39;ve also ordered from here a plate that included a salad. As I ordered I was asked what kind of salad dressing I wanted. Then when I got home I had no salad. Or dressing.I&#39;m tired of not getting what I order here. I&#39;ve had it. I won&#39;t be back.

I am sad the category of this restaurant is Mexican. This is not Mexican food this is NEW Mexican food which has its own unique culture and cuisine. For those of you who don&#39;t know, the state of New Mexico is between Texas and Arizona, below Colorado. This is also just New Mexican inspired food. Real New Mexicans don&#39;t charge a freakin&#39; dollar for a sopapilla (they are served with a meal) and they don&#39;t ask if they want hot or mild, they just serve you the chile.I am from New Mexico and this place is just OK. They say they have chile from Hatch which is somewhat believable, the taste is not like places in New Mexico specifically Albuquerque (Los Cuates, Sadies, El Patio, El Pinto, The Range) which are fantastic. BUT this place will serve as my green chile fix while here in San Francisco. I do love their green chile chicken blue corn enchiladas. Enjoy just understand, it is New Mexican inspired food. I will continue to have my family ship me my green chile.

I had a friend tell me about this place, she ate here all the time, cause she lived around the corner from here. She said it was a little bit expensive, so I put off eating here for a while. I shouldn&#39;t have waited so long. Green Chile is only 4 blocks from my apt., and the food is great. Green Chile uses niman ranch meat so I can understand way it&#39;s a little more then your average mexican joint.

A good neighborhood place for a simple, clean lunch or dinner in a nice, laidback environment. The burritos are* different from those at Papalote or the Mission, but it&#39;s a good different! They use only organic chicken and beef. I could taste* the chickenness of the chicken in my burrito ($6.95) -- which is a pleasant surprise. It&#39;s not drowned in marinade or sauce. I like being able to taste my meat, esp. since these days it&#39;s easy to forget what chicken and beef really taste like. I also like the green chile pork stew and their decent selection of interesting juices, spritzers, and organic wines. The food&#39;s certainly not KICK-ASS tasty, but it&#39;s NOT tasteless. It tastes natural and healthy. Good hot chocolate with* free cookie ($3.95). Four stars instead of five b/c the portions can stand to be a little bigger and the menu can get a bit boring after going there a few times.

The green chile is good. The red chile is excellent. However, how can this place be called New Mexican cuisine when they don&#39;t serve sopapillas? There was a rumour that they&#39;d have them at the new location, but still no sopapillas. Docked a star.

On an empty stomach and with a fresh twenty burning a hole in my pocket, I decided to grab a taco plate at Green Chile kitchen with some friends. Wow! This place is perfect for a casual dinner among friends. It is not loud and the food comes out quick. I decided to upgrade to the combo plate. Best decision of the day. Got the Chicken Tamale, Enchillada and Taco. The Taco&#39;s here are loaded with meat. Not a big fan of the green sauces and chili&#39;s but overall meal was delicious. This was a nice little ending to my day.

I&#39;ve been there four times so far. Whenever I&#39;m in the neighborhood, I go there. (Only 4 times?!) However, I don&#39;t want to go there just for the food although the food is delicious! Yea Yea the reason is the parking situation over there. Last time I was there, I noticed that they actually bring your order made by phone to your car, if you park at the curb. That&#39;s very cool. I should try it sometime, but I&#39;m not sure if I can get a parking spot back in my neighborhood, Upper Haight. Ugh.

Mmmm, Christmas sauce. No, not the creepy mystery kind your uncle brought to dinner, a combination of green and red ranchero styles sauces, found here! First of all, Green Chile is using high quality meat ingredients, and telling the consumer where it comes from. That alone deserves the four stars!! On top of the phenomenon, the food is quite tasty. I sampled some nachos that were the best outside of home made I&#39;ve had in quite some time. The burrito was a little bland (even though I got it super styles), but everything tasted fresh. Their tamales weren&#39;t half bad either. The interior of the space is rather small, kind of dark, and pretty cold on days like the one I experienced (rainy, early evening).

Update, I ordered food to go and if you are from New Mexico you know this is not what they serve in New Mexico. Don&#39;t get me wrong it was good but not what I&#39;m use to. It is a yuppie version of Mew Mexico food, so for the area with no street parking it is still worth a visit. The posole was good and spicy with the red chile. If you order the red chile it is spicy but it was made with no-meat vegetarian red chile? this is strange...In New Mexico we eat burritos with fried pork meat (so good). The green chile is ok, it has spices that I have never tasted before.

My friends from New Mexico tell me that this isn&#39;t really authentic (note the &#34;inspired&#34; tagline), but when the cravings for green chile something kick in, I usually find myself here. The roast chicken is also pretty yummy, and I can&#39;t think of anywhere else one can have green chile mashed potatoes. Added bonus: beer, wine and tons of dessert options to satisfy my sweet tooth.

Delicious San Franciscan-Mexican food. While not an &#34;authentic&#34; burrito, it was still really yummy. What earned them major points in my book is that they use all organic ingredients, free range chicken, and Niman Ranch beef. I had a super burrito with Niman Ranch beef w/ sour cream, guac, and salsa- YUM. The restaurant itself is so cute too! It is clean, cool, and welcoming- it kind of reminds me of a slow, sunny, sunday afternoon lunch type of place.

The food is good, but my problem is that I think I don&#39;t understand Tex-Mex. I think T.M. tries to be Mexican, but it&#39;s just not there. I&#39;d rather hit up a good Taqueria any day, but I live close by and have tried this place a couple of times.I don&#39;t like the fact that you have to pay extra for one of their sauces. My opinion of Mexican-related food is that salsa MAKES it what it is. I don&#39;t think one should have to pay extra for one of their sauces, it should be standard for them to include it.Also, portions aren&#39;t that big. Food is good, and it&#39;s very fresh. Just a couple of things I&#39;d like to see different to get a higher Yelp from me.

Their super chicken burrito is addictive, &amp; they have a nice selection of natural sodas to choose from (each different one I try seeminly more delicious than the last). The staff are friendly &amp; chatty, &amp; just my luck, it so happens to be four blocks from my house. Highly recommended if you&#39;re in the Panhandle &amp; on the hunt for a high quality NEW Mexican style burrito.

Having lived in SF and eaten every variation on &#34;the Mission burrito&#34; for more than 17 years, I&#39;ve never found it easy to call a winner... until now. The steak burrito at Green Chile Kitchen is THE WINNER, at least in that category. Every element is a refinement of the lardy and lower grade ingredients found in many burrito shops (for example, Niman Ranch beef). Also their salsas are freaking incredible. and... THE SIMMERED PORK BURRITO PLATE. mmmmmgggggghhhhh. Informal seating and layout great for kids, a nice addition to the hood.I know some people will stick to their favorite shop because they like the particular brand of lard used in their burrito, or because they like to remember their first date with their boyfriend, but I suggest you honestly put religion aside and judge Green Chile based on QUALITY rather than tradition...Anyway, for me, this is now the very first place to take out-of-towners. After calibrating your meter at Green Chile, theres always time to stop by Castilito, Pancho Villa, Papalote, Balazo, Zona Rosa or whatever.

There&#39;s been maybe two times where I thought it was decent, but two other times it gave me green chile diarrhea. I&#39;m not sure why I went back after the first time I got diarrhea, but nevertheless I was fooled into eating another mediocre order of nachos. My girlfriend complained later that night that her stomach wasn&#39;t settling well from the burrito she had eaten, which she had so accurately described as looking like a &#34;choad.&#34; Will not be going back.

Feeling a little homesick, I did a little Google-ing for &#34;reminds me of Dos Coyotes&#34; to see if I could find a replacement for one of my favorite places back home. I was surprised that my search actually yielded some usable results including a place in Cupertino that I plan to try next week. GCK also came up and I decided to hop on a 24 over to W.A. to try them on for size. Tonight was an experiment, trying to take in several flavors at once so that I could form a good opinion of the place -- unfortunately this meant I ordered a few things that I ended up really hating, but I also found a few things that were really freaking delicious -- hence the 3-star review. I imagine that with some fine-tuning (on my part, not theirs) that I will find an amazing selection that fits my particular tastes, the menu certainly looked tasty. I really hated Dos Coyotes the first few times that I ordered from there, but it eventually became one of my favorite places, which is why I am so optimistic that I will find the right combination on GCK&#39;s menu with time.

I&#39;ve only been there once, but I&#39;ll go back a few more times I&#39;d imagine. I was there with a buddy that lived in Santa Fe, and he agreed that the stew is top notch. We also split a 1/2 roasted chicken with potatoes on the side, but the taters were really uncooked (they&#39;re just a side of the same green chili stew potatoes which normally finish cooking in the stew), and we let the staff know. The lady behind the counter was interested in how the food was and took our comments/recommendations with great interest. She then went into this long winded diatribe about her personal business philosophy that made no sense when we thought about it outside, but hey...you gotta have heart to survive in the restaurant beez-neez in this town - that&#39;s fer sho. I&#39;m looking forward to trying some Niman Ranch burritos - I love NM shtuff and don&#39;t mind the non-gut-bomb-sized burritos they serve here.

We were so excited when they finally opened, and we went there a few times. The burritos are pretty great, made with high quality ingredients. The trouble is that we got tired of them really quickly, as the quality tended to diminish every time we went. The first couple weeks, the owners were very kind and offered great service, but as they hired more staff, the service got worse. Not to mention that the price is way too much for what you get. $2-$3 bottled sodas? Not even some fancy restaurants charge that much. Needless to say, we don&#39;t go here much anymore.

I had the Green Chile Stew, and it was delicious! Big chunks of Niman Ranch Pork, with potatoes, and green chilies. It also had tomatoes, but they didn&#39;t over power the flavor. (I&#39;m not a big tomato person) There was a kick, but you could still taste after it was over. The staff was super friendly and helpful. They are a new restaurant, and probably still working out the kinks, but they are doing super well. I hope they last longer than the other burrito joint that was in the neighborhood, although they are more than a burrito joint!! I recommend it highly!

The menu is conveniently posted on their website. I especially enjoy the make-your-own-salad option.

Truly Delicious!: A tasty, fresh meal in burrito form. This is no taqueria. (Other reviewers favor the taqueria for its size. I say that&#39;s a silly and crass way to rate food quality.)

my boyfriend used to live around block from this restaurant and we would go almost every week. although that&#39;s no longer the case, we still make it back whenever we can. the restaurant itself is clean and cozy inside, albeit crowded at times. the food is terrific- especially considering the price point. the vegetarian nachos are amazing! big enough to share and so delicious! all of the breakfast items are good, but usually have slightly smaller portions. even the coffee is excellent! extra points for using many organic and sustainable ingredients, and for serving everything on heath ceramics.

ive been constantly disappointed with the food as well as the service.because this location is hyper local, meaning its steps from my front door, it has convenience but that goes out the window because the food is gross.on two different occasions, my order was incomplete, lacking the ingredients that were claimed to be in the food .... the ingredients called for potatoes, and all i got was zucchini and squash. i voiced my concerned.i ordered a breakfast burrito out of a hangover desperation.... ingredients called for bacon... i didnt get bacon in my very expensive breakfast burrito.over all, the food is not appealing, perhaps its the legacy of the location itself. also more importantly to myself,. the place is so lilly washed and lacks any type of diversity what-so-ever. and the service people seem to treat other brown people very particular.so whats more of a turn off, the food or the service... well both. and for me... thats all it takes. i will continue to walk past this place with no desire to support my hyper local businesses. i will stand waiting for the bus as if this place never existed, because i can only be fooled for so long before i realize its not me... its them!!!yuck, thumbs down.

treat it like any other burrito store, in what you expect. but there&#39;s also good wine, beer and kombucha! steak super burrito with red sauce: the end all be all of this place. niman ranch steak, making it the best burrito in the city - better than all others, especially those that serve up the dirty beef!

food is very good but the service is scattered and everyone from the kitchen to the front person is unbearably slow

Awesome chicken burritos with the green chili sauce! Friendly staff! I am sad that I moved out of this neighborhood right before they opened - this is a perfect addition to the neighborhood!
