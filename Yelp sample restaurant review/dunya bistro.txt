Tonight we odered -Falafel salad - Absolutely Brilliant!! We shared this between 3 of us and were all fans.Lamb Skewers - GoodLamb Burger - Pretty plainVegan Stack - Pretty plain but tasty and healthyThey seat 3 at tiny tables with very little room. The food came out quick, but service was generally inattentive.Toilets are really modern and clean, despite being one toilet for everyone.

My friend and I were visiting San Francisco and stopped in this amazing little place for drinks and a quick bite. We were greeted by an inviting bar and friendly host. We ordered the Malbec and Mezze platter. Service and food was divine! When in San Fran, you must stop by and say Hi and eat at Dunya!

I really can&#39;t complain about the food. Just one incidence of rude service, but that&#39;s all it takes to sour me on a place.My wife and I stumbled into this place a month or so ago and had a wonderful time. Excellent food, charming and attentive service, really great lighting. We sat at one of the small corner tables that book-end the entrance.We are in this neighborhood frequently and when we saw it was open at 3 pm on a recent Saturday afternoon, we had no doubt where we enjoy an early meal.That all changed immediately. Three of the six sidewalk tables were empty. Inside, five tables were free -- not to mention the completely empty long table adjacent to the bar. A four-top, two two-tops, plus both corner tables. (It&#39;s worth mentioning here that the corner tables are the same size as the two-tops but have the added charm of being in a corner, allowing for a more intimate dining experience.)The waiter/host directed us to one of the two-tops. I politely asked if we could have one of the charming corner tables. He abruptly said those tables were for three people only. (I dare any three people to eat full-size plates at one of those tables.)I replied by pointing out that the restaurant had eight empty tables, not to mention the long table by the bar.He grimaced and gestured again at the two-top. &#34;That is what we have for you.&#34;My wife and I looked at each other, spun on our heels, and left. Screw that crap. We took our appetites and our money down the street to Lemongrass (lemongrasssf.com) and had a wonderful meal.We might be particular but the quality of the food and environment at any establishment are insufficient. The dining experience includes and even depends upon polite treatment. If a place is half-empty and it&#39;s not yet 3 pm, let the customer have their requested table.There are more restaurants in SF than we can ever hope to experience in one lifetime. Why put up with rude treatment?

At first glance, Dunya looks a lot more like a Spanish tapas/wine bar than a Turkish place, but the servers are friendly and the food is fine. Nothing to call home about, but not a bad place for a glass of wine and some apps.The mezze platter had a good mix of items, though portions feel like they should be slightly larger. Two dolma and two falafel balls aren&#39;t easy to split. The muhammara was the stand-out item here, smoky and nutty.The lamb kebab was somewhat tough, but the seasoning was on point. The lavash bread underneath did a good job of soaking up a lot of the grilling sauces.

My review is more for the waitress than the food, which unfortunately I was never able to try. After being ignored when I walked in and eventually seating myself, I had to fetch the waitress to ask for water and a menu. She never came back to take an order, so again, I went and got her. After 30 mins in this place, she brings me the wrong order. &#34;Oh, well do you want this?&#34; She asks. Awful.Disappointed, as the food looked great, but I won&#39;t be back if she&#39;s there.

I went to Dunya for lunch earlier today with a bunch of friends. It was an ok experience overall. The mezze platter appetizer taste better than I expected and the chicken shish kebab wrap was average at best. Service was pretty good and the server was friendly. I guess because we were the only group at that time right before happy hour starts. Atmosphere was nice but I still think that the price is pretty high for what you get. Would I come back? Probably yes but not anytime soon.

We were looking for a new place to try in a different neighborhood and we love mediterranean food so we wanted to give this a try. It was great. The environment is just right so that you can just enjoy the food and conversation. The food was amazing - we got the Rosemary Orange Olives and a couple other things to start and the Mixed Grill for entree to share between the two of us (with some extra rice). Very moist grilled meat and lovely rice. We&#39;ll definitely be back to explore the rest of their awesome menu. We ended with the Mango Panna Cotta - really nice for an option that&#39;s subtly sweet!Prices are standard and the wine was nice!Other reviews comment on the service so I&#39;ll add to that as well: They are sweet but maybe seem a little confused at times. A bit more thorough knowledge of the menu would be good, but they were certainly accommodating and attentive albeit not obnoxiously so. We couldn&#39;t complain.

Came here on Sunday for the bottomless mimosas and to try brunch with a Mediterranean twist.Our server, Ahmet, was awesome. He was friendly and knowledgable, and made sure our mimosas were kept full.We started with a traditional hummus, eggplant and tzatiki platter, and borek- filo dough fried and filled with feta cheese and cooked to perfection.Ahmet recommended to try the Mediterranean ranchero, so my friend went with that. Pita bread baked with cheese, hummus, topped with pommodoro sauce and 2 eggs. I kept it simple with the Polk omelette- bacon and avocado. The boyfriend had French toast and smoked salmon omelette. All of our plates were clean by the end of it- we were satisfied to say the least.We somehow saved room for baklava, it is made in house and is a must try!I would recommend making a reservation if you go on a weekend because it was starting to get pretty busy as we headed out around 12:30.Highly recommend!

Usually love this place for brunch but last time our mimosas tasted terrible. How do you mess up a mimosa? I don&#39;t even know. I told the server we didn&#39;t like them and he was incredibly rude. He still charged us even after we voiced our concerns.

It&#39;s nice to have a bottomless brunch option where you know there won&#39;t be a crazy wait to be seated and for that, Dunya does a job for boozy weekend brunch.Some eyebrows raised around the mimosas though. Served in Brita-like pitchers, it&#39;s mysteriously clear which got us to think that it&#39;s probably a powdered orange mix they&#39;re using... kinda like Tang. However, the staff compensates by being very friendly and attentive, frequently doing the rounds to keep you topped up. I had the lamb burger at brunch that seemed to be a highlight and it was a pretty tasty burger. The lamb was well-seasoned and juicy. The fries looked good but disappointed. They could&#39;ve been crispier and used more salt. The side salad - a generic afterthought. It&#39;s a tasty burger but competition at the $14 level is pretty tight and there are plenty of really good burgers at that price point that perhaps overshadow this one.Still, for a lazy brunch in the neighborhood, you shouldn&#39;t discount Dunya because the service here is really good and the food is decent enough without having to wait long to be seated.

Love the low key vibe and lack of a wait associated with Dunya&#39;s brunch!I went to Dunya with a very large party for a bottomless mimosas brunch and we were all thoroughly pleased with the endless mimosas and all of the entrees. Although, none of the entrees stood out as particularly noteworthy (like the Challah French Toast at Olea or the Truffle Benedict at Mission Beach Cafe), the general quality across the board was up there.I had the smoked salmon benedict with house potatoes and was very satisfied. It was exactly what you&#39;d expect out of a smoked salmon benedict - smoky, savory and creamy. The mimosas were a bit heavier on the Champagne than the OJ but hey, when has that ever been a bad thing?I highly recommend Dunya for brunch if you&#39;re looking to have a great bottomless time with several friends without the annoying SF brunch wait.Happy Eating, Yelpers!

I have to divide this review in 2 parts to be honest:Food: it was 8 of us and everyone was happy with theirs food, we us musaka, appetizers, lamb burger and salmon. The food was really good and had a very Mediterranean flavor.Friendliness: I don&#39;t know if we were simply not lucky but the waiter was super rude, he kept rushing us in trying to make us finish quick our dinner and take our plates away even when we were not done. He kept pushing us to take more wine even though we didn&#39;t want more and totally didn&#39;t deserve any tip even though we ended up giving him a lot!

This place is a LOOT market! They are literally robbers! I have no better words to say.They charge &#34;tourists&#34; 20% tip, as they say is their restaurant policy. How do they know you are a tourist? Well, they assume it and make random guesses. Worse yet, they say its 20% tip, but its more than that. Ours was 22%. And the server kept saying she has no idea why do have such a retarded policy since its what the manager decided and the manager was absent in the restaurant!The food was decent but they are literally robbers. So if you are a tourist, and if you end up here, make sure you check your bill! We are SF residents, and we still paid 22% tip since they assumed that we were tourists. I&#39;d say never go to such a place!!

When is the stupid trend of serving good beer in a jar going to end? It ended long ago in most places in Europe when beer drinkers got tired of looking at the vine drinkers not having their vine served in a glass jar. It&#39;s stupid and not showing good beer any respect.

I live for lamb. Not everyone prepares it well. I assume Mediterranean spots would be great at preparing lamb, but I&#39;ve been failed by this assumption. Not this time. Dunyan is super cute, quaint, and lux. The lamb was better than I hoped for. The spice on the skewers superb. The burger juicy with a great bun. Only critic would be the truffle fries were less desirable. Overall great place will definitely be back.

The staff is super untrained and unable to do their job. One of them was so clumsy he wasn&#39;t able to keep 2 glasses of iced coffee on his tray and poured everything on me and my boyfriend. He barely apologized and went back to work. We of course had to leave the restaurant and our friends immediately since we were covered in iced coffee. Too bad because the owner was nice, but I&#39;ll never go back there. Being a waiter requires skills and training! If you&#39;re not able to take an order and carry heavy glasses on a tray, go do something else.UPDATE: I had a comment that it was an accident. Indeed it was, but the restaurant should have offered something to fix the situation and make us want to come back. The waiter just left and we didn&#39;t get any free meal or an invitation to come back for a free diner or even a free coffee. Also, I just described a single event among a bunch of things that happened beforehand. Hence this review.

If you happen to walk by and you&#39;re in the mood for turkish/mediterranean, give it a try. But as you&#39;re perusing the menu,e my falafel salad was SO overdressed with vinaigrette, it was basically a pile of saturated green leaves with falafel balls topped with sauce and another dollop of wet guacamole ontop of THAT. I mean, another pound of lettuce greens might have made it balance out ok.Otherwise, place was cute and I&#39;d go back =)

Had high hopes but it was just OK.Hummus was so-so (too lemony) but the pita was fresh and warm. For the size, the hummus appetizer was a bit overpriced.We ordered the lamb and prawn kebabs so we could try each. The lamb was tough and chewy- not tender/juicy. Prawn were the best bites of the night.The accompanying vegetables weren&#39;t that exciting but the grilled onions were tasty. Rice was decent.Didn&#39;t try the wine but they have an extensive wine bar in the restaurant.Service was fine. The seating is a little tight along the wall and it&#39;s hard to get in and out without disturbing those next to you.I have to say that there are better Yemeni, Moroccan, Afghan, and Lebanese places in the area with better food that&#39;s cheaper. I probably won&#39;t be back to Dunya.

I have to say I don&#39;t understand the hype about this place. I went at a happy hour time to get food/dinner. The decor was nice, rustic, and kind of cool. They have a nice wine selection.The food was really only mediocre. We ordered a lentil soup that was just ok, tasted a bit better after adding lemon inside. Here&#39;s the weird part: We ordered a whole fish which was grilled very perfectly, meat tasted fresh. But it has this smelly, rotting smell that is similar to smelly cheese or stinky tofu. We asked the waitress (who was super duper nice to us, by the way) to ask the kitchen what they put in it. We expected the answer to be some kind of secret Turkish spice or fish paste, then we&#39;ll be ok with it. But the answer came back to be lemon.Our waitress was super nice though - she decided to waive the fish dish for us and it was on the house eventually. It&#39;s still a mystery to me what was put on that fish that was smelling so weird! We just knew it couldn&#39;t be just lemon!

Came here for brunch on a Saturday afternoon and it was a pretty good experience, but nothing truly outstanding.FOOD:-Borek: This might have been the best thing on the menu. It&#39;s essentially a warm crispy eggroll filled with cheese and parsley.- Mezze Platter: This was nice for sampling all the different mezes - we ordered 2 for a group of 8 and it was the perfect portion. Nothing exceptional on the platter though..- Proscuitto Panini - This was slightly disappointing for me. It was just a really salty sandwich..and wasn&#39;t the right balance at all. Hardly tasted the mozzarella...meh.Over, the food was alright, but nothing really exceptional.Pros:I did like the overall ambiance of the place, it was pretty spacious and I liked how they could accommodate our group of 8.They were super nice to our bday girl, and gifted her with a free drink and really good baklava.Bottomless Mimosas also didn&#39;t hurt either...though they started to get more and more orangethe longer we stayed (as the champagne to juice portion started to diminish) haha, oh wells.

Dunya is a quiet and quaint little joint.Food: My sister and I split the ararat salad + chicken shish kebab. The ararat salad was so good! Such a perfect balance of flavors and it really is such a light and delicious salad. The chicken was also good-we split the veggies, the rice, the flat bread, and the skewers. All really good flavors.Service: They offered wine tasting of the daily special wine and didn&#39;t even card us (Mind you, I turned 19 in November.. so should I be offended or flattered that they think I&#39;m that old?). My sister really liked it and it was the perfect pour right before the Asian glow begins.. haha! They kept refilling our water which was good. But something super annoying was that somebody came to take our plates when we still had some left on it.. 30 seconds later, another person.. 20 seconds later, another person.. 10 seconds later, another person before we snapped and just ate the remaining tomatoes and cucumbers. That&#39;s annoying to people sitting at the bar trying to have a personal conversation and savoring our salad!Atmosphere: super cozy and cute. Very hip SF style.It&#39;s a bit pricey but I think you pay more to enjoy the company you have in a cute restaurant.

Being from Washington DC, hearing the words &#34;Brunch&#34; make my ears perk up, my heart beat a little faster, and my stomach growl like a small lion. In addition to Seersucker Thursday on Capitol Hill and Georgetown Cupcake lines that stretch two blocks, weekend brunch is a DC tradition that makes any DMVer (DC, Maryland, and Virginian for you Non-Mid Atlantic Folk) excited. So how does the weekend brunch at Dunya stack up? Well let this East Coaster break it down for you.First and foremost, getting a reservation here is a must. I came here with a large group, and thankfully for the planning of my peers and the helpful staff, we were able to seat a dozen of us between two tables. The brunch menu consists of Mediterranean inspired wraps, sandwiches, and omelettes, as well as some unique twists on favorites such as huevos rancheros and eggs benedict. In addition, there is the ever popular bottomless mimosas which I will get to later in this review.So how was the food? I ordered for myself the falafel wrap and a cup of coffee. The food came out pretty quickly for how busy the restaurant was. The wrap was one of the better falafel dishes I have had. Crispy, hot, and surprisingly dense, the falafel was very good and was a nice contrast to the tahini sesame sauce and cool veggies. The size of the wrap was also more than hearty enough for my brunch needs. As a side, my dish came with a small side salad with a simple, slightly sweet vinaigrette and delicious thick cut french fries seasoned with what I believe was sumac, a slightly tart seasoning popular in Mediterranean and Middle Eastern cuisine. I liked the fries so much in fact that I was tempted to order an additional plate on the side (I resisted). So what about the mimosas? I unfortunately am not the biggest fan of drinking during the day since it makes me sleepy, but everyone at my table who ordered it gave it a thumbs up. One thing I did notice was that since it was served from a batch made pitcher, the colour of the mimosas varied from vibrant orange to pale yellow. Whoever was mixing the drinks didn&#39;t really have much consistency with the OJ-Champagne ratio.The restaurant itself is on the compact side. There are several smaller tables both inside and outside as well as a small bar area. The wood plank walls were very interesting as they were slightly decoratively charred with various food-related words. It was a nice touch. One thing I did notice during my visit was that as the brunch hours passed and the mimosas flowed, the restaurant got increasingly louder without the number of patrons really changing. Keep this in mind if you were hoping for a quieter experience. The staff was a highlight of the restaurant. Despite having a massive group, we were taken care of efficiently, our drinks refilled regularly, and were overall treated very nicely.So what does this East Coast brunch snob think of Dunya? Overall I was impressed. The food was good, the was service quick, and the value was also decent. My wrap was only $10 which netted me a nicely filling meal. Brunch it up, my friends!

3.5 stars. The place is small and charming. The food was okay for the most part. Loved the falafel salad and eggplant. I did not enjoy the mixed grill, salmon carpaccio or other appetizers as much. We had a party of 6 and latecomers. I felt a little rushed like they are trying to get us to finish up. Multiple times they tried to take away our plates before we finished. There was an empty seat next to me and I left my purse there. They asked me to remove it. I don&#39;t know if they were going to have someone sit with the 6 of us or something. They brought us the check without us asking for it, I don&#39;t know what to make of that.It&#39;s not a bad place for a quick dinner or lunch I&#39;d say. However, I wouldn&#39;t come back for the service and attitude I got last night.

The mixed grill platter was huge enough for two people! We left feeling ABSOLUTELY stuffed. The lamb skewers were my favorite! So flavorful. And chicken wasn&#39;t dry at all! When it comes to Mediterranean chicken I&#39;m always afraid the chicken will be too dry. NOT HERE! Service is attentive and prompt, and they have a great wine selection. Ask for hot sauce!

Teamwork.Good: Eggs and tomato sauce. Pita and hummus. Warm weather and San Francisco.Exceptional: Mediterranean Ranchero with all the above all at once. Made even better thanks to outdoor seating on such a beautiful day.Reasonable $13 cost especially considering the price includes a small side of potatoes. Staff was friendly and attentive.

Food was ok. We tried the chicken and beef skewers. They were under seasoned for our taste. We sent back the fries because they weren&#39;t cooked all the way through and they begrudgingly made them again...the exact same way. Server was friendly and the atmosphere was nice, it was a cute place.

Really great service. Reasonable prices. Bottomless mimosas on the weekends for 12$ until 3pm. Had the Chicken Kebab wrap, was really filling and delicious. The fries were also really good. I would definitely reccomend.

Was excited to try this place. I came here with a small group of co-workers during lunch time.The service was perfect. Our server was attentive, quick and very polite.The food, however, was not really what I expected based on the reviews. (Maybe it was because we came during lunch?)For the table, we had the tzatziki, which I really enjoyed. Light and creamy!I ordered the smoked salmon panini. The combination of the fish and the goat cheese made it quite salty! The others at my table ordered the angus burger (heard it wasn&#39;t anything special), chicken pesto panini and the ararat salad, which looked quite refreshing!I&#39;m hoping I&#39;ll be able to make it back. The place is quite cute!

Ahmet, what a great server. Bottomless mimosas are on point, and Ahmet didn&#39;t give us a time limit. Bottomless until 3 means you drink until 3, no questions asked.Also, the servings of sides... amazing. Usually you ask for a side of bacon for $3, and you get two slices. With Dunya, $2 gets you 6 slices of bacon. Well done, well done.We&#39;ll be back Ahmet, looking forward to it my friend.

Nice place . Nice foods .Waitress was really good.Clean !Kunefe looks goods , mixed kebab us delicious !But ...Turkish restaurant is good with turkish tea or coffee ...After having lunch I really wanted to drink a cup of tea , but waitress told me that they dont have turkish one and they can offer only teabags .For me turkish coffee and tea are something amazing , especially after heavy meal like kebab.That&#39;s why , I really want that in the future drink a cup of tea there after having a good dinner .

Food was subpar. We got the lamb wrap, chicken salad, mujarah dip, and stuffed falafel. Not very tasty. The potato soup was good. We ordered a chicken dish which took over 40 minutes to come out. They told us the oven baked chicken takes longer but 40 minutes is ridiculous and they should really give people a heads up. We were finished with our meal by the time the dish came out. The staff were accommodating but kept explaining how the dish takes longer and it is on the way. Our waiter seemed annoyed by us liked we were being unreasonable for being displeased and impatient.

Terrible service. Food was mediocre. My boyfriend and I ordered the stuffed falafel salad with shrimp, lamb shish kabob, and dolma. Brought my drink about 15 mins later because he forgot about it. Seemed like they didn&#39;t have enough people helping since it took about 20 so mins to get our bill. I even tried to stop a waitress and ask if she can get our bill but was ignored. She came back around 20 mins later to ask if we had wanted anything since we called her. It made us really uncomfortable. Everyone just seemed rushed. It wasn&#39;t an enjoyable service.

Great Mediterranean meal.The mezze plate and calamari together with the mixed grill and a vegan pyramid which was ample for 4 people.However as we were on holidays we decided to share the baclava and a chocolate dome for dessert.Both were good but the chocolate done was spectacular.Overall the flavors were excellent, service was typically good and overall this was a very enjoyable meal and something we are happy to recommend.

Welcome to Turkish Brunch!In a party of three, we were unable to get seated right away, but the bar was open, and they had no problem doing a full meal service there. The bartender was friendly, and even did the math for us on bottomless mimosas &#34;I don&#39;t want to judge, but... this is a better deal&#34;. And because I suck at math, I pulled out the trusty cell phone, and he was right: as long as they wanted at least three mimosas (and both of my companions had about 4 or 5), it was a VERY good deal -- ended up costing about $2 a mimosa... for West Bay? That&#39;s like robbery!So on to the meal -- it was a little slow coming, but they were super-packed, and the waiter was dutiful at keeping our beverages stocked.I had a simple corned beef hash, which was a little chunky for my tastes, but the big problem was that my two &#34;poached eggs&#34; were quite literally hard-boiled by the time they got to me, which is why this is not a 5-star rating. Why it IS a 4-star rating is that when I told the server, he not only apologized and sent it back, but he apologized at least 3 other times I could count. Also, the second time around, the eggs were perfectly poached with runny yellows.Everyone cleaned their plates, everyone was slightly drunk, and none of us had anything negative to say about the noise, decor, service, or price. For what you get? This place is an amazing bargain.Get in before they get hip and jack their prices.

Prices have gone way up (even by SF standards!) and the quality / portion sizes do no justify the expense. You can do better in the neighborhood.Also, the online menu doesn&#39;t reflect the latest pricing. Get it together!

I ordered the beyti for brunch; my boyfriend had the chicken shawarma. Reminds me of Troya in the Inner Richmond.We had a great brunch here - the service was prompt, the food arrived quickly. With so many other brunch places full of people, this is an amazing alternative - instead of waiting 90 minutes at a nearby corner brunch place, we waited ... Zero minutes.The portion sizes were decent and fresh. My beyti - with lamb, tomato sauce and creamy dipping - was to die for.Great place to keep in mind for brunch!

Parking is horrible but the food makes up for it. Note to self ... if you live in the city do not attempt to find parking around polk.Must have the eggplant puree. For all the desi people reading my review this is Baingan Bharta served cold with pita and kicks ass of any baingan bharta I&#39;ve had in the city. Follow this up with Lentil soup which is tangy perfection. OMG I totally love it. Will be coming back for some MOAR Lentil soup soon !

Was craving mediterranean food, and a friend suggested Dunya. Good service, cute atmosphere, and decent food. A solid place.We split the tzatziki, and I had the kofte kabab. Also tried the adnan kebab. The food was good and solid, not amazingly spectacular. The service was good and prompt. My favorite was actually the grilled veggies.I liked it, but I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d be going back for food alone. I&#39;d tag along with friends for decent food. To get a higher rating, I&#39;d want more meat and better spicing.

I had great hopes for this spot based upon the high star count, but alas, I found myself quite disappointed.Let&#39;s start with the positives:- Outdoor seating- Cool lanterns on the outside- Cute puppy was near my table (puppy proximity may vary)Negatives:- Eggs Benedict was overcooked. Not runny at all. Basically a hard boiled egg on an English muffin.- Service was pretty bad. Didn&#39;t get refills on water or coffee until we got the check. Basically forgotten about by our server.-Coffee was not freshOverall this was a 2.5 star experience.

Solid food, really inattentive service.We go for the lamb burger which is really juicy and flavorful. They also do a well priced bottomless mimosa for weekend brunch.But the service is consistently poor. While the people are friendly, we always have to get someone&#39;s attention to order, refill water, get the check, etc. One time we sat ourselves down since no one was around, and we went unnoticed us for 10 minutes as we tried our hardest to make eye contact with the waiter. My husband had to literally get up and chase after someone to get menus. We reluctantly go back (we really like that burger!) and the experience is always the same unfortunately.

On President&#39;s day, wife and I wanted to go Swan Oyter Depot and cash in our Groupon at Bob&#39;s Donuts.Swan decided to get all patriotic and close down for the day.Had to use bathroom...STAT!Dunya guy was nice enough to let me use the facilities.There was the most glorious smell from the kitchen.Wife and I decided to have lunch because of the waiter&#39;s kindness and the lure of kitchen&#39;s perfumery.I must have some good karma or need to stumble into more restaurants looking for a loo.We ordered the Mezze Platter...a sampler of all the appetizers, a lentil soup, and a Greek salad.That Mezze Platter was quixotic in the best way...a tour of falafel, dolmas, muhammara, eggplant puree, hummus, and tzatziki. All this came with a million triangles of pita bread...or at least enough to make you feel like you don&#39;t have to ask for more.A lunch of shared entrees and appetizers=35 for two.This place will dunya good!

I&#39;ve always brunched at Dunya and had really positive experiences each time - solid brunch food, great friendly service, and even better bottomless mimosas. I actually celebrated my birthday here and they were more than willing to accommodate our large group and everyone had an awesome time.I tried it out for dinner about a week ago, expecting a decent meal, but nothing that blew me away (because when do you get lucky enough for a good brunch AND dinner spot???) and was TOTALLY impressed with my meal. The salmon was SO good (the lentil lemon garlic sauce on top was a perfect compliment) and didn&#39;t leave me feeling heavy or gross after my meal. The calamari appetizer was a good portion and also came with some pita, which is great and a good deal.All in all, REALLY enjoy the service, food, ambiance and extensive wine list with varied prices (we&#39;re talking PAGES) at Dunya. Five stars!!

I was really excited to try this place after reading many good reviews (and I love mediterranean food). My friends and I shared a bottle of the sparkling rose which was good and the hummus. The hummus had a good creamy texture but the flavor was pretty bland. I think I&#39;ve made more flavorful hummus than this (or at least bought better hummus from the store). I ordered the grilled eggplant entree which came with yogurt, tomato sauce and some rice. When ordering it, I did not expect half of an eggplant to come out (sliced lengthwise). I expected cut eggplant that was grilled and mixed with other vegetables but nope, just a full on eggplant that was slightly grilled. The yogurt and tomato sauce didn&#39;t blend well together. The only good thing about my meal was the rice. My friend ordered a chicken kebab but it wasn&#39;t cooked all the way so she had to return it and they cooked it a little better the second time around. My other friends ordered a mixture of the lamb/beef kebabs and they liked their entrees.Overall, the food wasn&#39;t that great despite the hype.

All Fab.Owner is a lovely man.What I&#39;ve been torn always is the constant change in wait staff or kack there of.I&#39;m one who hates asking for water , another glass of wine or sitting alone and waiting twenty minutes for my check.

The lamb burger was well prepared and the lambs flavor could come through since it was not loaded with too much stuff. The rice was light but with a perfect nutty flavor. Good spot if you want good food without spending too much money or time.

Me and my boyfriend came here for the first time for brunch. I ordered Greek salad and he ordered eggs Benedict and late for $26. According to him these are the best eggs Benedict he has tried and the latte was really good. My salad was really good however I think that the portion was a bit too small. In general the portions are small even the eggs Benedict. I guess that is good because you don&#39;t get all too full. Also there is bottomless mimosas for $12 with real oranges inside. I personally didn&#39;t have it but I will order next time. The place must be really nice at night. The atmosphere is really nice. Will come back.

My gf got a Groupon for Dunya and we decided to check it out the day before my birthday. I arrived at 6:30pm and no one was there. My gf arrived around 7pm and we ordered off their happy hour list. Apparently on Wednesdays, its Ladies Night. If you get a glass of wine, you get the same one free! Wow!We ordered the Crispy Ahi Tuna Tartare , Florida Prawns And Organic Butter Lettuce, Smoked Salmon And Grits Pancake, and the Pomegranate Sirloin Steak. The prawns in the salad were ginormous! The tuna tartare were wrapped like an egg roll. The smoked salmon pancake was unique and delicious. Unfortunately the sirloin steak was forgettable. Super dry and bland and overcooked. The happy hour deal was a great deal. A glass of wine and appetizer for $10 along with the Ladies night deal with the buy one glass and get one free. A great place for a happy hour spot or dinner w/ a date. I&#39;ll definitely come back and take advantage of the deals!

Horrible, rude and a complete waste of time. No &#34;welcome, come in, how are you this evening, how many in your party?&#34;.. Nothing like this. Just pointed to the bar, and didn&#39;t even ask if we wanted to sit there.. LameOnce again more of the same SF hipster, yuppies and tech kids claim another place is great, awesome and delicious.. until we real people actually go there. I&#39;m not sure who these people are getting to write their reviews but wow this place was so totally rude, unorganized, and had a waitress who couldn&#39;t handle the work load she was given so instead she gave our food to the table next to us, realized the mistake and then tried to give us the &#34;already eaten and touched food&#34; that the table next to us had taken.And the idiots who took it, were so &#34;in love&#34; with each other even they didn&#39;t know that the food placed in front of them wasn&#39;t even what they ordered.But the worst part of this is she then tried to just hand it over to us.. as if we hadn&#39;t see it all happen or would care that the food had already been touched by someone else&#39;s hands.. GROSS AND UM.. HEALTH CODE VIOLATION HELLOOOOO. At this point we walked out for fear of what they were doing with all of the other food.20 mins to get a piece of bread for my 7 dollar hummus? Dump, dump, dump ya.. is what I call it. Horrible place, horrible service, and soooo not worth my hard earned cash.

Intimate, casual atmosphere, good service, and acceptable but unremarkable Mediterranean food. I went for dinner with a friend on a weeknight, and this place strikes me as a nice location to relax with friends, catch a soccer match at the bar (one ~30&#34; TV with low volume showing Premier League) , or go on a casual date.The menu is full of Mediterranean classics. The presentation was appetizing but not too creative, and the flavors were good, but unremarkable. Many dishes seemed slightly tuned to American tastes (cream-based sauces, deep frying, etc). The quality of the ingredients was middling, and the preparation uninspiredThe service was friendly and very quick, and they had a few daily specials.The atmosphere and service were fantastic. The problem here is that they&#39;re hedging their bets with the food. If the dishes were more daring, authentic, or flavorful, this place could easily bump its star rating.

We ordered the lamb meatball appetizer, red lentil soup, and mixed gill platter to split. The lamb meatballs were amazing, but there were only three to share. The red lentil soup was okay, but that&#39;s only because I was recently eating it in Turkey. The chicken and lamb kebabs were great! The kofte and Adana kebabs were good too, just not as flavorful and moist as I am used to. The service was very friendly. Nonetheless, I always need a go-to Turkish place, and this will be it in Nob Hill!

Dunya has become one of our regular hangout spots. No fuss, no muss, just a great wine list and always delicious food. Our usual includes hummus, lamb meatballs, Greek salad, a glass of malbec and petite sirah. Other dishes were great too. I remember getting a plate and the lamb was cooked perfectly.HH may be the best time to visit if you can make it! It runs 7 days a week, and it&#39;s $10 for a glass of wine and an appetizer. Where else can you find that??

I&#39;ve always loved coming to Dunya and enjoy everything on the menu. My favorite is the mezze platter because it has all the dips and it&#39;s fun to share! Tonight, I had a really great experience with our server Carlos. I ordered the lentil soup and when he came to clear the plates he noticed I hadn&#39;t touched too much of it. He asked me if I didn&#39;t like it and I was hesitant to answer at first, but was honest and said it was a little tomatoey for me. He told me he&#39;d take it off our bill and insisted even when I said I would pay for it. It meant a lot that he went the extra mile to notice and I will continue to come back for the great food and amazing customer service!!

We ended up staying well over 2 hours and even made new acquaintances with the people sitting next to us. This was one of the most fun and relaxing Sunday brunches I have ever had. Thank you Dunya - we will definitely come back for more!

Ole Ole, a neighourhood gem. A mediterranean cusine with some excellent twist.Adana Kabab is the one we gravitate to during dinner but they have a far more broad menu for b&#39;fast and lunch i found out when I took my friend for a quick bite and drink before the 49ers game.For the romantics in you they have live music - flamingo and gypsy guitar. When no live music they play a variety of spanish music on Pandora...MAJOR drawback was the recent redo to the bar which saw my choice of draft beer go down from 8 to 3 -- those that the wholeseller gives a bar a better break on. Had to switch to bottle brews :(Wine list could n should be broadened in my opinion.Overall a fun date nite every time!

I ate here as part of a group of four on a Saturday evening. We shared a mixed platter to start and some filo pastries filled with cheese, which I found to be excessively rich. The platter was good to share, but the pitta bread was very soft and doughy. I enjoyed the lamb kebab as my main, as it was full of flavour and complimented well by veg and rice- I strongly recommend this. I had the chocolate dessert option which was great. Overall, good food, clean, pleasant ambience and attentive service. Prices seemed just right.

I really wanted to like this place, but the staff makes it incredibly hard. We came here for brunch, sat outside. Food was pretty good, but service was terrible. Somehow the waiter thought it was ok to wipe the table with a napkin that he then say our silverware on. It was hard to get anyone&#39;s attention. We won&#39;t be going back.

Good chicken kebab! The cheese boreks were ok, they used the egg roll wrappers instead of better dough. Service was slow on Saturday night, one waitress for the entire place but would go back and try another time.

Came here with my girlfriend for brunch on Sunday and my experience was awesome. What a better way to start your day than bottomless mimosas and some quality food. Everybody was really nice, helpful and every question we had was answered professionally and with a smile. I can&#39;t stop thinking about their baklava since we left. It was amazing. Definitely a must.

I&#39;m very disappointed in leaving this review.I used to come here once or twice a week because its a short walk from my place and a cute place to meet friends....though that said, the wine is overpriced.Sometimes the service can be annoying, for example, the place is empty, yet they say well you can sit down and eat (its around 7) but you have to leave at 8 because we have another reservation. I mean really? Is there any other way of handling this?It seems there is a better way.But then last time I was sitting at the long table near the bar...and my friend said look and pointed to the wall which was 3 inches away...there was a cockroach 3 inches from my face staring straight at me. I made a scene (hey I dont like surprises)...and they moved my plate and comped my wine. I kind of think they should have made a bigger deal of it than they did...like it seemed like it was a nonissue to them....which makes me question the cleanliness and therefore question returning.

My father and I visited this cute little restaurant/wine bar in Polk Street! I give them 4 stars because they use organic and local ingredients :)We both ordered the lentil soup and falafel appetizer. I had a glass of Rose wine, can&#39;t remember the brand but it was French. And my father also got the Vegan Pyramid (layers of grilled vegetables on bed of fresh pomodoro sauce) and a glass of Zinfandel. The food was nicely presented, and the portions small and manageable.For dessert I had the Baklava.Good quality, friendly waiters, nice wine list, what more could you ask for!

I am a huge fan of breakfast potatoes and consider myself something of an expert on the subject . Home fries can make or break a meal--this is serious. The &#34;country potatoes&#34; served on the side of all the egg dishes at Dunya are tops in my book. Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside...I nom them HARD. Bfri loves the Stuffed Falafel Salad. Service can be slow at times, but the staff is always super nice. Definitely a solid place to stop for brunch on Polk Street.Minus one star because the mimosas (although bottomless at brunch) sometimes leave something to be desired. Not enough bubbles..too much Tang!

This is the night my friend and I were not meant to eat. We came here hungry, even let our waitress know while we were ordering how hungry we were.We started with 3 flights, Zin-Cab is a must try!Lamb meatballs- must try (should&#39;ve ordered two).Calamari with artichoke- skip it.Mezze Platter- great variety and awesome flavors!Finished our appetizers and then waited for the Mixed Grill... waitress: &#34;it should be coming soon...&#34; 15 minutes later no mixed grill. We asked for the check and to have the entree taken off, at this point it was 10:10pm. The waitresses kindly apologized as well as the chef. Offered desert for error, tried the hazelnut desert (don&#39;t waste your money). And it took another 15 minutes to get our check. It&#39;s a bummer because this place is so close to where I live, probably won&#39;t go back.Fortunately my friend and I are in the hospitality biz and got a good kick out of it.We spent over $30 each and left hungry.

I have lived down the street from Dunya for some time now and finally managed to stop by for dinner this weekend. I was meeting some friends who had been out watching football all day and were a little rowdier than normal, but they set us up at the long high top table and managed us just fine. Props for that.A friend and I shared the Mezze Platter (my kinda meal) with the calamari. I loved the hummus and the tzatziki, and their stuffed grape leaves were standard. My boyfriend had the lamb burger which I stole a bite of: if you are looking for some serious meaty indulgence I would highly recommend this...yum. For a small place, I was surprised to see their wine list had a nice variety and reasonable prices. If you are even slightly tempted by dessert, get the baklava. I will say no more.I&#39;ll have to stop by for happy hour, they have a fab deal: $10 glass of wine + app! Can&#39;t beat it.

I only went here for and appetizer and a beer. The staff was so considerate and understanding, not making me feel guilty for only getting an appetizer which a lot of places do. The decor and presentation of food is so elegant and the taste of the food is even better. I was totally in love with this place from the food alone. The Mezze Plater is really something to behold, bites of Dunya&#39;s many appetizers. Its actually a good amount of food and every item is so delicious, flavorful and well prepared. Even the bread is nice and warm. This place has the details down to a T. I am definitely coming back for a full meal soon.

Solid 3.5 for food and rounded up for service and ambiance!Searched small plates on Yelp and found this tuck away. Super cute and close to other bars! Went with a date and it was a good date place! Not overly intimate and not overly lively. Liked it! Plates were hardly small...BUT def not complaining:-)Ordered the Tzatziki, which you have option of adding veggies with pita. Nice touch! Their recipe is on the thick, creamy side. Good with food, not a stand alone.Goat cheese stuffed falafel salad- Really good! But I am definitely biased because anything goat cheese stuffed is a winner in my mouth!Salmon kebab- had a lemony sauce that was a nice touch. Fresh! Not overly seasoned, just fresh and healthy.Lamb meatballs- ehh! Just OK!Calamari- Jammin! Really Good! Would order again!The best part... wine selection is just right! Bottles are super cheap and probably the best value over the by the glass menu! Yep, I&#39;ll be back with friends!

Been here a couple times since I moved up, and I&#39;m not quite sure how I feel yet. I love the chicken kabobs, really flavorful and I love the fresh veggies and rice you get on the side to go along with it. Hummus was a little lacking in taste for me, and I remember my friends saying their food (steak, lamb burger) was just average. The kabobs, ambience, and the fact that it&#39;s near all the bars keep bringing me back but the service is just way. too. slow.

Don&#39;t waste your time or money for the $12 bottomless mimosa. Unless of course you want terrible service. We saw the bottoms of our champagne glass so many times and had to ask them to fill it. On top of that, the guy dropped a utensil on me as he was cleaning the table. The reaction was not of concern for the guest (me) at the very least.

More expensive than advertised. Food prices are creeping up in SF and Dunya has not updated their pricing here on Yelp. The lamb burger is now $14.00 and the Adana Kebab is now $16.00, so with tax, that&#39;s very lean meal for two, costing $33.00 before tip.

Seriously one of my new favorite places on Polk. How did I not know about this for 4yrs living in the neighborhood? Amazing Mediterranean food, attractive servers, delicious wines, layed back yet classy atmosphere all at reasonable prices ..good deal to me.For dinner try the falafel salad (falafel balls stuffed with goat cheese), tzatziki, salmon carpaccio &amp; feta prawns. And don&#39;t miss the Zinfandel. Thinking about it makes me want a glass. Now.There&#39;s only one larger group table, so it&#39;s best to come with 2-4 people. Make a reservation and get seated right away or you could wait a bit. Can&#39;t wait to try this place for brunch or lunch.

Great little place on Polk street.Decent wine selection and prices. Fast and friendly service.I went there for brunch, and I got the Huevos eggs with hummus and flatbread..very delicious! A nice little Greek twist on a classic Cali-Mex Breakfast item.The sides of potatoes was okay. I wish it was crispier and had more flavoring.I loved the decour very nice. The front bell motif is cool, but less beams would be nicer. it makes the entryway look a bit out of place compared to the rest of the place.

Was walking my way to Swan Oyster Depot when I realized it&#39;s closed on Sunday.Kept going on Polk until I stumbled across this place which aroused my curiosity. I almost didn&#39;t go in due to the 3.5 rating, but you know what.. That&#39;s just ain&#39;t fair.Got to say, unjustified 3.5.While it&#39;s definitely not perfect, everything I ate was good and the place has a good vibe to it.We had the platter, lentil soup and falafel wrap all great.Was debating whether a 4 or a 5 will do, but decided 5 will help bump the place up to his 4 stars rightful place.

Who knew a stuffed falafel salad would be so yummy? I didn&#39;t, considering I&#39;m not a huge fan of falafels in the first place. But stuffed with cheese and surrounded by lettuce and guacamole? Yes please. I also got the pleasure of enjoying their calamari, which is always a good idea. The appetizer portions are also huge. Two apps was plenty to share between two people and result in a full stomach.So food? Check.However, I went there simply to drink wine. Their Chenin Blanc is amazingly refreshing and smooth. I got two glasses, just because.The bartender was smokin&#39; hot. Enjoying a glass of wine after work and checking him out was definitely worth it.The place itself is cute and really close to my place, so it will be a neighborhood fav.

Terrible service. Two of us got in 10 minutes before another group of 4. We were seated at the bar and were told to wait for tables to be cleaned up. We looked around and found 2 vacant 2-person tables and a 4-person table with a lot of empty plates. Then the group of 4 came, the table was instantly cleaned up and they were seated. We waited for another 10 minutes before being ushered to one of the empty tables. I ordered a cup of coffee while sitting at the bar but it never showed up. After sitting down for 15 minutes, nobody even stopped by to give us the menus. At the same time the group of 4 were ordering with the waiters.This kind of service made us just speechless. We stood up and left right then.

One of the best restaurants I&#39;ve been to in SF. The staff is very friendly and professional. The food at Dunya is amazing. I&#39;m a health nut and eating fresh is very important to me. After learning that all of their vegetables are organic and everything is basically hand picked by the chef and the owner this place became more enticing. I also drink wine. Another great thing about Dunya is that they&#39;re wine selection is better than a lot of the restaurants I&#39;ve been to. I will strongly recommend my favorite wine at their restaurant, a red blend, called Caricature. Lastly, their dessert is something everyone must try. The baklava if my favorite. I&#39;ve made this restaurant a regular place to visit. A tip would be to make a reservation since it is a popular place in the area.

Went to Dunya with my mom and brother around 3 pm on a Friday. We were the only ones in the place, but it still took 5 minutes for anyone to notice us. The server did not immediately bring over water- we had to ask. The food was decent but it took a long time to get to our table, and it seemed as though it had been sitting out for a while (which is odd because we were the only people in the whole place). Will not be back.

When the Boy and I were in a hurry to make it to a guided tour of the Haas-Lilienthal House down the street we stopped into this aromatic, little joint at around 1:30pm on a beautiful, warm and sunny Sunday.The decor was hip and chic and the scents and sights of food drew us in like the cartoons-by our noses.We were seated quickly and the wait staff were friendly and attentive.The menu offered so many delicious Greek/Italian fusion choices that we had a tough time deciding but we were in a time crunch so I ordered the Prosciutto Benedict and The Boy got a lamb burger.Our food came very quickly and we always share so we swapped bites of savory, juicy lamb burger with a crusty bun and generously doused (and perfectly cooked and seasoned) garlic fries and perfectly done and salty prosciutto benedict with a tender English muffin soaking up the sauces. We were in heaven. The portions were perfect and our tummies were happily full as we got our timely check and made our way to the tour. We both would definitely go here again.Delish!

Oh, Dunya, how I love you.There are so many things that I love about this place other than the amazing food. But while I am talking about the food, you should definitely try out as many things you possibly can on the menu ... it is ALL amazing. You can totally tell that the chef and kitchen staff know what they are doing and care about the food they prepare. Baklava.The wait staff and owners are delightful and super knowledgeable, and will do whatever they can to accommodate any requests you make ... something that is so refreshing. Baklava.The ambiance is great--low, romantic-ish lighting, but not so much so that you feel strange popping in with a group of girlfriends, and they have a TV back by the bar if you want to catch whatever game is on while you enjoy some great wine. It definitely has a fun, hip vibe without feeling pretentious. Great place to unwind after a long day at work. Baklava.Check out their brunch on the weekends--they are generous with the champagne in the mimosas and don&#39;t make you ask 7 times for refills like SO many places I have been to in the city. Baklava.I think the thing I love most about this place is that they remember their patrons and really make you feel welcome and are gracious that they have won your repeat business. Baklava.There&#39;s really nothing that isn&#39;t fabulous about Dunya. Def one of my favorites in the city. Baklava.Baklava.

so one fine weekday evening, we drive from San Jose to SF and end up at this place. Don&#39;t know how and why...but at the end of it all, no regrets.it&#39;s a small place and it was pretty late for a dinner (10.30pm) so relatively quiet as well. The server/bar-tender was attentive. Suggested some wines. Ended up getting a bottle for the table. I had the chicken shish kabab which was delicious. the falafal in the appetizers were pretty good as well.Loved the wine (Chardonnay), Love the Kababs...loved the ambience with a minimalistic design and open view of the kitchen.def. worth another visit to try out their other kababs.

I think this is a gem on Polk street. $10-$16 for an entree that&#39;s pretty damn good. Their daily fish special, lamb kabobs, and soups are my favorites. Food can take a bit long to come but they prepare everything fresh, so it&#39;s worth the wait.

I think this place is a fab little find....thanks yourestaurant.com(even though those gift certificates are not valid at Dunya anymore!)The waiter/host was super nice and adorable and comp&#39;ed us a delicious hummus/babaganoush/yogurt platter because of therestaurant.commixup. We were all very pleased with our meal -- I consider myself quite the lamb connoisseur, and I completely approved of their lamb shish-kebab (although you have to request it well-done unless you like it medium-rare inside). Each dish came with a side of ride and butter-cooked vegetables, both of which were fantastic. My roommates got the vegetarian appetizer platter dish and the chicken wrap, both of which they said were great!I know this is a wine bar, so next I come here with my roommates we will probably try the wine+appetizers (which are large in portion).Worth a visit, and many more after that!

Do you LOVE flights of wine for $10 and cheap bites in wine bar atmosphere? If so, don&#39;t miss out on happy hour at Dunya.The lamb meatballs were TDF (to die for), as was the salmon, and the tuna sashimi. I loved all the wines included in the white flights (full glasses!).Be sure the make a reservation onopentable.com, or else you might be turned away.

With Casa Hookah gone, I knew this place would be better...and it was. Even though I am only (at this point) giving them two stars, the previous establishment was so awful I encourage people to stop in at Dunya and give it a go.$12 bottomless mimosas are amazing...and when you bring along your friends who wouldn&#39;t want to spend the afternoon sipping champagne with a splash of OJ? Sadly, the mimosas here are very weak and pretty much just $12 Orange Juice. Further adding to the below average mimosas is that fact that they just come by the table and fill your glass up when they think it is ready. Needless to say, you may be waiting long enough to be drinking another Mimosas.The food can be good, but I have personally experienced some inconsistencies. I really like their hummos and pita bread. Their babajanoush was some of the worst I have had because of its flavorless tone and unauthentic texture and general peculiar texture.I would give Dunya another chance, but I think they need to get their Middle Eastern dishes down and they may need to hire another server to balance the work load.

While the overall impression seems positive it has gotten some mixed reviews- but after last night I&#39;m surprised with some of the ratings on here. I had a fantastic time and will absolutely be back.We had a great bottle of pinot noir and chose the duck and seafood risotto for entrees- everything was delicious. I&#39;m all about sharing plates but other than exchanging 1 bite (don&#39;t get me wrong, the duck was great too) I cleaned my entire plate of risotto- apparently there&#39;s a reason it&#39;s listed on the menu as a chef favorite! Shrimp, scallops and cheesy goodness? Delightful. Good thing I had a run planned the next day because it was worth every bite.Our waiter was hilarious and we got along with him really well- I feel like we really bonded and formed a friendship with this guy but of course forget his name so I&#39;ll just call him our waiter-friend. When our waiter-friend was off his shift he stopped by our table one last time to say bye. He was on his way to grab his bike and already wearing his helmet so joked about wanting to convert us- Mormon missionary style.We realized too late that we were the last people there and they were waiting on us (oops) but the staff was so nice and even poured us each an additional glass of wine from one of their bottles behind the bar.Can&#39;t wait to return for brunch (I&#39;m a sucker for bottomless mimosas) or the weekday happy hour.

Fresh, authentic, home-made style Mediterranean/Middle Eastern cuisine, superb and diversified wine list with many &#39;per glass&#39; choices, with a cozy and informal atmosphere. Friendly and attentive service. What more can you ask for?Answer: more fresh seafood selections...octopus would be nice!

I live in the neighborhood and was excited when I heard there was a new wine bar opening. What lured me in was their happy hour. I&#39;ve been back a handful of times since then and just tried their dinner on Friday night with a girlfriend. Their happy hour specials are AMAZING! For $10 you get a glass of wine and an appetizer. I&#39;m used to paying $10 just for a glass of wine so this was a treat! The portions are very generous. It&#39;s not a little glass of wine with a two-bite appetizer...you&#39;ll be satisfied with what you get...especially for ten bucks!On Wednesdays it&#39;s ladies night. If you buy one glass of wine, you get one free. They also have flight specials for $10 - I&#39;ve tried both the red and white flights and they were fantastic. The owner was even nice enough to let me try the wines before ordering just to make sure I was happy.What I&#39;ve tried for happy hour:The grilled lamb riblettes are probably my favorite appetizer. Not only do you get the riblets but you get a nice salad to go with it. The lamb is tender and falls right off the bone. The ahi tartare and shrimp salad are also tasty. Each appetizer is paired with a complementing wine.What we had for dinner on Friday:My girlfriend and I shared the mediterranean plate. Their hummus and baba ganoush are homemade and both are delicious. It comes with warm pita bread and a few other things. I ordered the grilled lamb chops for my entre. These were tender, juicy and cooked to perfection (medium rare the way I like it). I asked for no potatoes so he substituted them with spinach. I&#39;d definitely get this dish again, but next time I&#39;m trying the risotto. A few guys sitting next to us ordered it and it looked (and smelled) fantastic. My friend ordered the smoked salmon pancakes and the grilled lamb riblettes for her meal. I LOVE smoked salmon so I stole a few from her. They are yummy bits of heaven.I was surprised to read some of the comments regarding the staff. They&#39;ve always been attentive and extremely friendly. This neighborhood spot will make you feel welcome and will treat you like family.If you don&#39;t live in the neighborhood it&#39;s worth the cab ride or drive over. There&#39;s a parking garage on Sacramento Street (between Polk and Van Ness) if you can&#39;t find street parking.I&#39;ll definitely be back. They have the best happy hour in town (trust me when I say this because I&#39;ve been to MANY hh&#39;s). The dinner was excellent and I can&#39;t wait to try their brunch with bottomless mimosas!

We loved the food, service, and atmosphere here. It&#39;s a tiny place, but cute. We were able to walk in with 5 on a Sat night, but then the tables were full. The staff was very friendly and attentive, and the food was good. We had a selection of appetizers dolma, falafel (loved), hummus and eggplant. The chicken kabobs were our favorites, but lamb and others were good too. We enjoyed the wines, but the selection of bottles was more extensive than by the glass. Flights are available at the bar only.

Just got a bottle of wine and a selection of apps and was pleased with everything! Food was tasty, wine was delicious (got a bottle of the zin-cab blend, which seemed popular that night). The place was full but not too crowded, so it was comfortable. I&#39;ll be back to try out their brunch! $12 bottomless mimosas!!

Went here with a group of friends for a nice dinner out. The place is awesome, the service is friendly, they just need to get their menus/cooking a bit straightened out.We ordered two bottles of wines for a group of 6 and they were both fine. No issues with the drinks at all.But food wise we all ordered various things:Appetizers:Stuffed Green Olives with Lambs - A couple of my friends got this, I didn&#39;t try it but the main fact is that when the dishes came, there were no olives on the plate. Instead it was a plate of salad with 4 lamb meatballs. We asked our server who then confirmed that we were correct, there were no olives so they just had the lamb meatballs tonight. My friends said they were fine to eat, but just in principle they surely didn&#39;t get what they had ordered/expected to eat.Crispy Ahi Tuna Tartare - Again some of the other people in our group got this for their appetizer. Let&#39;s just say it wasn&#39;t really ahi tuna, but more fully-cooked tuna eggrolls. Again, they were fine but not what was expected and definitely not ahi tunaSmoked Salmon and Grits Pancake - This actually came out the way it was expected. I had a bite of my friend&#39;s and it was alright. Not absolutely amazing but the grit pancake had a nice texture to them. The salmon was nothing our of the ordinary and the crab was a nice touch.Capay Farms Organic Greens - With my love of beets, I got this salad but was sad to find only 2-3 small pieces of beets when my salad came out. As a one out of three of the ingredients listed, I was hoping for much more but was sad to find a measly few.Entree:Grilled Pomegranate BBQ Kobe Sirloin: I think 3/6 of my friends got this dish and was not very impressed with it. For me, it was very odd to find that two of them seem to have gotten &#39;filet mignon&#39; cuts and then the third got a VERY marbled piece of sirloin (more so like ribeye even) cut. They all said the sauce was a bit overpowering, I had a taste of the meat. It was ok. My friend definitely had hers requested at a Medium and receive it more so on the rare side. Again, another friend had tons of fat on his making it less like a sirloin.Pan Roasted Fresh Scallops: I got this dish, which ended up being more of a pasta dish. There were maybe 3-4 small pieces of scallops and even then, when I was chewing them, I definitely felt some pieces of sand or something that made crunchy noises. In addition, the dish wasn&#39;t very hot which made me think it had been sitting there for a bit and thus was not fresh. I didn&#39;t even finish the dish, I got a bit turned off 1/4 through it.Grilled Romesco Muscovy Duck: This was a pretty good dish, I think from what my friend had said after eating it. She did say though that it was dressed a bit too much with the sauce and it was overpowering for duck.Dessert:It was a friend&#39;s birthday, so we asked to have a mini celebration for her. They came out with a cheesecake, which even between the 6 of us was NOT finished. And this cheesecake was NOT that big (maybe 4&#34; in diameter?). The cheese did not taste like it was made with the correct type of cheese. A bit too intense for cheesecake.Overall, the food was a bit of a downer. However, service was absolutely amazing. She was sweet enough to give us the cheesecake and a small bottle of bubbly because we were celebrating our friend&#39;s birthday.I think I&#39;ll give them the benefit of the doubt and say it was an off night for them especially since all the other reviews are full 5 stars! Give them some time since they just opened up and return back in a few months and hope for better. All in all we had a grand time, but the food wasn&#39;t what we expected nor did it blow us away.

I found out about the restaurant fromGroupon.com. I had the impression that it was a Mediterranean establishment in the sense that I&#39;d be able to order some baba ganoush or falafel but instead I had options like duck, lamb, and salmon.I ordered the ceviche of the day which turned out to be far from what I expected. While it was possible to actually taste the fish, there was not a hint of lime, which in my opinion is a key ingredient to ceviche. Instead it was a sweeter melange of mango and perhaps orange juice.I ordered the sea scallops and my friend ordered the duck. The sea scallops were quite tasteful and well cooked but the pasta sauce tasted like expensive Chef Boyardee and the carrots were undercooked. The duck dish was an extremely small portion and my friend reported that it was overcooked.They did bring us delicious freshly baked bread a good 20 minutes after we had initially ordered. It was accompanied by olive oil over a delicious olive tapenade.Dunya is well described as a wine bar as it has a great selection of wines. I had the Sexto from Spain and my friend had the Sonoma Marrietta Petit Syrah. I would recommend both.I was worried I&#39;d be under dressed but the place turned out to be comfortable, casual, and classy.

We also got an extra glass of wine each even after we paid, just because....can&#39;t say no to that!

I would love to return here for lunch and get one of their grilled chicken sandwiches. I was a little disappointed those weren&#39;t served at dinner.I did enjoy my shepherd&#39;s salad with grilled chicken. My boyfriend got a meat dish wrapped in lavash and was disappointed that his entree didn&#39;t come with rice like the other entrees. When he asked the waiter about his missing rice, the waiter brought him some gratis. I thought that was a warm gesture.

I stumbled upon this place because I found it on Groupon. I will go back. The food was delicious and the service was outstanding.Got milk? Had to have a glass with dessert and they were out, so the waiter actually left the restaurant to get some from elsewhere.The food didn&#39;t come out too fast , but the atmosphere is cozy so it didn&#39;t matter. The waiter brought out a couple rounds of tasty bread (warm from the oven) with olive oil and garlic-good stuff-while we waited.When the entrees arrived we were impressed. The food was very flavorful. The chef came over and chatted us up. Very impressive indeed.I highly recommend others to go dine at Dunya.

I wouldn&#39;t give this a one star.1) Walked in the front door and was not acknowledged by any of the staff.2) Stood there for about 2 minutes until finally getting service.3) Sat outside the waitress stepped on my shoes, and was insincere with her apology.4) Waited almost 20 minutes for 1 appetizer and 1 entree in an EMPTY restaurant with no other dining customers.5) Never followed up with our opinion of the food.Overall bad service, bad food, don&#39;t waste your time or money!RATING: GARBAGE!

So glad to have an upscale restaurant in my section of Polk Street. This is the mid rent district sandwiched between Lower Nob Hill and Russian Hill.I went here last weekend before the final episode of &#34;Breaking Bad.&#34; We were in a bit of a rush, so I was constrained to order only one dish.I had the pan roasted fresh scallops. It consisted of scallops, fettuccine, organic mixed vegetables in a fresh tomato sauce. It was delicious.I&#39;ll have to come back and try their lunch menu.

They better higher more cooks, have a better menu.. and cook better...wish I could say something positive.. oh.. they were kind enough to refill our bread basket 3x (2 because we were starving while waiting for our food that took like an hour..and 1 more time.. after we saw how much food they gave us) O_o

I ate here late last year and forgot about it until now, as I was searching for a new Mediterranean place to try. It was overpriced for the size of the portions, but the food was ok.The falafels were good - crispy and good tasting. The lamb gyro was great - the lamb itself was very succulent and aromatic, and the rest of it was decent enough, I can&#39;t really remember anything besides the lamb. My friend got the chicken gyro, which he said was good but not astounding.The service was good, the waitress made a mistake on my friend&#39;s order but took it back and brought the right dish a while later. The seating was very tight and a little uncomfortable IMO. The ambiance is nice, definitely the type of place to go out for a nice dinner, not grab lunch with buddies.The lamb gyro was awesome, I want to go back, but it emptied my wallet more than it filled my stomach.

I finally tried Dunya again, but this time for dinner. It was fantastic! Had the Adana kebab and then the kunefe for dessert. Both were delicious. While the chef was really friendly and came to our table to greet us, the wait staff wasn&#39;t quite as attentive or hospitable. Nevertheless, I will definitely come back to this great neighborhood gem!

This is a really cute place. It&#39;s small but they were able to seat a large party of eight on a Friday night at about 6:30pm without a reservation. The wine was good and the food was decent.The Staff was friendly but beware this place no longer acceptsRestaurant.comcertificates. Thankfully our waiter was kind enough to honor it, but I&#39;m not sure if they will continue to do that because there was some slight resistance.

I stumbled upon this cute little place while waiting for my dog&#39;s grooming in Nob Hill. Very impressive wine list! I found out they have only been opened less than two years. The wait staff is very friendly as I sat myself at the bar counter by my lonesome. Bar guy is super nice and allowed me to sip a variety of international wine. I settled on something from South Africa and ordered their falafel appetizer. It was like crack and why the 5 stars. Goat cheese stuffed inside! It was a guilty pleasure blend of warm crispiness on the outside - not too salty - with gooey deliciousness on the inside that melted like heaven at the same time I was flashing my devilish stare. I broke up with my uncommitted raw diet relationship that day.

Having lived and studied cooking in Istanbul for 4 years, I&#39;m pretty picky when it comes to Turkish/Mediterranean food. But Coskun does a pretty good job of recreating an authentic meal at Dunya!We had both vegetarian as well as meat dishes - everything was spot on with a subtle Californian twist. Save room for dessert as the kunefe was perfect.As delicious as the food is, unfortunately, the waiters here kind of suck. I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s because they might not know English that well, but they are some of the unfriendliest bunch I&#39;ve come across and don&#39;t do much to earn tips, not even smile.Definitely go, but go only for the food and enjoy!

The place is not huge but staff are really friendly. Ambience is nice for a date night as music is at the right volume so it doesn&#39;t drown out conversations but doesn&#39;t make for awkward silences.Food:Lamb meatballs - lamb meat is very well cooked. The meatballs are stuffed with chopped olives and gives it a really nice Mediterranean flavor. The side salad with feta that came with it looked more like an afterthought and was a little unnecessary.Shredded pork fettuccine ragu - meh. The pasta was tasteless, not even salty enough to make for a good pasta. Pasta tasted like it was pre-cooked and cooled down so it doesn&#39;t hold on to the tomato sauce so it just tastes like plain pasta with a side of shredded pork in tomato sauce. The pork was alright too. This is their special so it&#39;s not on the regular menu.Seafood rissotto - It was pretty good. The seafood (2 shrimp, 2 scallops) were pretty well cooked and decent. It tasted fresh. The rice was good. The whole dish was pretty good. $20 good? No.The wait staff was really nice and upbeat. However, when someone asks me how the food is, I mean to tell the truth. I said it was good, but I was suprised by the extra small portion of my fettuccine dish, especially compared to the man next to me that got the exact same thing and was obviously a way larger portion. She goes &#34;oh...okay.&#34; and walks away. Mmm...ok...We had a groupon so overall it was a just alright experience. Our bill before groupon was around $45. I think without the groupon my feelings about the place would have been a little lower.

Going downhill so soon? One month ago this would have been five stars.The food is always, as others have mentioned, spot on. This has become my new Sunday brunch spot, with the bottomless mimosas being a huge plus. I&#39;ve had five different selections off the brunch menu and none have disappointed.However, the last few weeks have seen a change in staffing that&#39;s changing my opinion. When the busboy is paying more attention to you than the two servers, there is a problem. This Sunday and last, the server responsible for the bar patrons seems mostly annoyed that he Is there, much less having to take orders, carry plates the four feet from the kitchen pick-up to the bar, and god forbid, fill an empty mimosa flute.Additionally, it seems that they&#39;ve lost the third server on Sundays. The food is taking much longer, and if you&#39;d like your check in 5 minutes, you should give him an additional 10 minute lead time.Please bring back the charming server who manned the Sunday brunch bar in early July. Having to rely on the polite, but very busy, busboy for mimosa refills is getting tiresome.Dunya, you&#39;re getting copycats on the bottomless mimosa brunch draw. It&#39;s time to renew the fantastic server staff that had us enamored when you first opened. We want to see you succeed, but there are plenty of other options on Polkstrasse.

The food was amazing, such a true taste of what Mediterranean cuisine should be. They have a nice open kitchen so you can see the cook and smell the flavors. I can&#39;t even explain what I had. There was lamb, hummus, olives, chick &amp; steak skewers. So much food for the four of us and it costs nothing. And it was so good. I already have plans to return next Thursday.They have a great wine bar as well, so there were people just hanging out having wine and appetizers. Which I will be doing more regularly.I recommend it to everyone. And try the baklava for dessert. The cook gave us complementary pieces and it was amazing.

I stumbled upon Dunya on my way back from the hardware store a few moments ago. The restaurant&#39;s warm, lush, elegant, parlor inspired decor and original artwork invited me in. My brunch order of a neatly layered ensemble of potato pancakes, smoked salmon, and poached eggs was a divinely balanced and flavorful offering. I believe this special premiered today, and I must say that it has earned my endorsement.That the waiter was out of commission due to a car accident this morning and the owner had to make a run to the shop next door to fetch some coffee on my behalf only served to enhance and render more intriguing my dining experience.I think some Yelp reviewers shortchange themselves when they expect perfection, as conventionally defined, in their dining experiences. For me, it is the little surprises, such as the owner&#39;s charming inexperience assuming the waiter&#39;s role due to his unexpected absence, that make dining experiences particularly delectable and worth savoring. I hope San Francisco is kind (and smart) enough to give this place another chance to tease and stimulate her palette. I will be back for ladies&#39; happy hour in a few weeks.

Yelp needs to have a 1/2 star. I really want to give it 3 1/2 stars.They have a great wine selection, but I feel it is overpriced. I mean $9-$10 for a glass of wine?We has hummus as the app and that was quite tasty. The pita was fresh and warm which made it AMAZING!I got adana kebab and it was good except I wasn&#39;t expecting it to be spicy. I like spiced, but never have i had it spicy. Since I don&#39;t like that I was not ecstatic. The rice and veggies that accompanied it were great though. Smaller portions ( I always like some leftovers to take home) but they were filling.The service was very attentive and the place is cute for a date. Overall not bad, but not spectacular

Lamb was inedible, mostly fat and what wasn&#39;t was undercooked. I gave it my a few minutes in my mouth before I spit it out. Everything else was par.

I just wanted to pick up a falafel wrap from here today. Dunya has really bonded with the coffee shop next door so it feels more comfortable to just walk into. I called to order the falafel to save time. I was told it would take 15-20 minutes. Poor girl, she&#39;d just started and didn&#39;t know how long it takes to cook something. But I&#39;d imagined they were just that busy -that a wrap could take so long. I have been struggling with a Mediterranean urge and haven&#39;t been able to satisfy it properly, so I decided to see how Dunya can do in this department. It was decently priced for 3 falafel, lettuce, special sauce, blah tomatoes, including garlic fries (yum) and bite of mixed-greens salad: $6.74. I had some struggle getting in and out with my lunch due to the sweet but chatty waitress. No one was there besides me, granted it was about 2PM, but it felt a bit desperate.Moral of story: the falafel wrap was as bland as could be. I guess a trip to Oasis in the financial district is still the only way.

I discovered this place 3 or 4 months ago, and what a great find that was! Dunya is by far my favorite Mediterranean restaurant now. Adana-Kebobs are best in the city. Staff is super friendly and attentive, atmosphere really cozy.

I tried this place a while back and really wanted to like it but was underwhelmed. I decided to give it another shot today.FIRST of all - service and other issues:1. I went in and there are like 6 people who work there all just kinda standing around watching me. It makes me feel like I&#39;m intruding in someone&#39;s home. They are all extremely friendly and eager to help, it&#39;s just a little odd.2. The happy hour special says that wine is half price 4-7. I ordered 2 glasses of wine and was charged full price. Nobody told me about any special. I found out only when I went to write this review. NOT COOL.3. The menu says all entrees are served with rice and vegetables. Apparently all except for the one I chose. When I brought this up, the manager/owner pointed to my plate and showed me some vegetables on it. When I pointed out that was not what I had expected, he brought me some wonderful roasted veggies and rice.4. I ordered some stuff to go after my meal.They sent me home with the sauce already on the salad and such and seeping everywhere. NOT COOL.SECOND - the food:1. Dolmas are one of my favorite things in the world. These were tasty, but super mushy inside, which was kinda gross.2. The beyti was good, but the meat was a little dry. It was also cold when it came to me even though I was one of 2 tables at the time.3. The wine list is really pretty darn good.4. The falafel is some of the best I&#39;ve had.5. The meatballs were supposed to come with romesco sauce and didn&#39;t. They were dry and hard.6. The hummus is pretty good, but they sent it with me in an overfilled foldover container so it spilled everywhere. They wrapped the pita in a roll, which was covered in the sauce they put on the salad.The wine list is redeeming. The location and the outdoor table are great. But I won&#39;t be back for food and will expect them to mess up everything if I decide to brave it for the wine.

I had a Bloomspot coupon that was about to expire so we made a reservation for 3 at 7 pm on Friday night. It took longer than we thought for my friend &amp; I to get out of the office, so my boyrfriend called to change the reservation to 7:45 pm. We arrived just on time, but apparently our reservation hadn&#39;t been changed &#34;on the books&#34;. The place is pretty small, so we stood at the bar and nearly finished off a bottle of Cotes du Rhone Rose before we were seated about a half-hour later. Since the coupon was for a certain dollar amount off of wine purchases, we decided to go with another bottle once we got seated. We then shared a few of the vegetarian apps to start: Kabak Ezme, Crispy Falafels, and Sigara Boregi; a plate of pita triangles came on the side.The Kabak Ezme was a kind of pureed zucchini-yogurt dip, flavored with mint, dill, and garlic. The dip was thick like Labneh, with a great yogurt tang and a subtle hint of garlic. The falafels were nicely crispy and just the right size - I am so tired of baseball-sized falafels. The accompanying tahini was very creamy and flavorful. The Sigara Boregi were just what they sound like - little &#34;cigars&#34; of feta and parsley wrapped in phyllo and then fried. These were actually my least favorite of the apps, just seemed a little bland compared to the others. There didn&#39;t seem to be much parsley *or* feta flavor. I even dipped them in first the tahini then the Kabak, but that didn&#39;t add any flavor either. They might have needed a little longer in the fryer as well, the phyllo wasn&#39;t that crisp.For our main courses, we opted for the prawn shish kebab and the beyti. The shish kebab was served as 2 skewers and was definitely enough for 2 people to share. It was a nice presentation of prawns threaded with lemon slices. The prawns were well-cooked and lemony and apparently marinated in &#34;exotic spices&#34;. The beyti was a dish not familiar to me, but it was delicious. Thin lavash bread was wrapped around oblong patties of finely ground beef and lamb. The meat was well-seasoned and spiced. A rather uninteresting tomato sauce surrounded the individual &#34;wraps&#34;, while some more tangy yogurt and some unremarkable veggies came on the side. We had filled up so much on the apps that we had to take some beyti home with us and didn&#39;t have room for dessert. The beyti tasted very good for breakfast yesterday :-)Minus a star for not having the Turkish national dish of Manti (!) and another for the seating issue at the beginning. I wish a couple dishes were more cohesive as well. There is another coupon today through SF Weekly though, so I will probably buy that and return to try the lamb burger and the piyaz based on their yum reviews.

Dunya rocks, especially for brunch. I am partly biased since I know the owner as well as his #1 server. But truly, the brunch here is amazing (omelettes with hummus) and the mimosas are generous pours. It gets great fresh air and a nice spot for group brunches.

I really wanted to like this place - my favorite style of food 3 blocks from home. I went for lunch (the place was empty - bad sign) - ordered a veggie panini and &#39;Turkish Coffee&#39; - neither had any resemblance whatsoever to what I was expecting. The veggie panini was a kind of grilled hero and the coffee was a brewed cup of the same kind of over-roasted slop so common around here.

A group of 4 of us visited Dunya for the first time last Friday and had an overall great experience. I had probably passed by Dunya dozens of times walking up and down Polk St., but it never really caught my eye until I was perusing Yelp. As we were already in the mood for Mediterranean, this was the perfect spot...a good mix of eclectic vibe, young (20-30 something) crowd and extensive menu (a little something for everyone...veggie, meats, etc.)I made a same day reservation on a Friday, and I&#39;m glad I did. There were a few large parties and a few 2-tops, and the place was packed. We were immediately sat and the &#34;cozy&#34; atmosphere made for a server/busser to always be available for an order or other need.Apps:Mixed Platter - Perfect for 4-6 people, great assortment of foodsFalafel Salad - I can never have enough falafel, so even though these came on the Mixed Platter, I still craved more. The avocado salsa was subtle, much lighter, zestier than a guacamole.Feta Prawns - OMG. The four of us (2 guys/2 girls) couldn&#39;t stop sopping up the broth of this dish. Seriously, pita, falafel, spoons--it was so darn good (4 prawns).EntreesPasha bayildi - Scrumptious stuffed eggplant dish. Seemed kind of Italian meets Greek to me due to the red sauce. Still, delicious stuffing. Great portion for a vegoMixed Grill - Yum. A generous mix of chicken, lamb &amp; beef. Can&#39;t go wrong.We shared everything and walked out just like Greek people...fat and happy. We also ordered beer, sparkling and red wine all by the glass. I was impressed by their selection and diversity of their by-the-glass list. Service was fast and efficient, not overly friendly, but not rude either. Just like I like it, there when you need &#39;em. Well-priced for the ambiance, food and service. Would go back!

Great date place or a nice night out with some friends. I HIGHLY recommend trying their dessert menu. My favorite is their Kunafa, delicious!

This is clearly a family owned establishment. We stumbled upon it while walking down Polk St, and thought the menu looked good. Unbeknownst to us, the family was celebrating a graduation that took up almost the entire dining room. Still, we walked into the bar, and they welcomed us into the party with open arms. The food and service was fantastic (try the calamari!). Great wine selection, and great atmosphere!

Let me start off by saying that I usually love this place and would give it 4 stars. However, my experience at brunch yesterday was terrible. My friend and I came by for brunch around 10:30am. There was one bartender, one server and one busser on staff which is definitely where the problem began. We were seated by the busser (who was awesome, and shouldn&#39;t be blamed in any way for poor service), and had to wait a full 20 minutes before even being greeted by the server. I ordered a coffee and then proceeded to wait another 20 minutes for the cream I requested, which was useless by the time it arrived as the coffee was cold. The server who was absolutely spacey, took our orders without writing anything down which was also a red flag. When our food arrived, my order was completely wrong. The server repeatedly tried to shove an omelet in front of me while glaring at me as if I were incompetent. After I refused the food for the third time he finally decided to give me what I ordered (which took another 20 minutes). My friend was forced to wait for his food as well while mine was being re-prepared, but the server brought out his original plate of food which was freezing and congealed. The server then offered a rather muted apology and that was it. We were also not offered refills of coffee or water until we had paid the check. What was really devastating was that the table right next to us had the exact same thing happen but their messed up food was &#34;bought&#34; by the horrendous server. Seriously!? Why would I not get the same service? I haven&#39;t been this disappointed in a restaurant in a long time but in this case it was all the servers fault as the food was still good. I would strongly suggest adding a person to your brunch service or getting rid of this useless one as he singlehandedly ruined a beautiful Sunday morning.

We went to this place using a groupon. We ordered the crispy ahi tuna tartar and the tuna looked like it came out of a can. It was not fresh. For my entree, I ordered the vegetarian vine ripe tomato risotto. It looked and tasted like rice w/ tomato sauce. I couldn&#39;t even tell what vegetables were in there b/c they were all covered in tomato sauce. I think it might have been potato. There was no mozzerella and definitely no avocado. I went with a group of 8 total and the only person who liked her dish ordered the chicken. The only nice part was the waiter. I definitely will not be going back.

great selection of wines! the bartender/waiter was knowledgeable (and very handsome) and the owner was hanging around -- really personable. very attentive service. my friend and I both had chicken soup, and I had the kobe steak, which was melt in your mouth delicious! loved the sauce and the grilled veggies that came with it. my friend had the pork chops, which she liked very much, as well. for dessert, we had the chocolate brownie, which was good, but would have been much better with ice cream or even whipped cream -- alas! I will definitely head back again.
