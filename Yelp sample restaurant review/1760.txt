This place was perfect. We walked in to eye contact and a welcoming smile from the bartender, and it went uphill from there. The cocktails were perfect - no wonder they won the Negroni award award this year. (Try their Negroni with TCHO cacao-infused Campari!)We&#39;re vegetarian, so ate from the appetizer menu and were extremely happy. Lots of care went into this place - the decor, the recipes, and the exceptional staff.

This was a great dinner. Overall we really liked our food and had a great time. No complaints about the service.My only slight complaint is that everyone raves about the Fried Duck Sandwich, but it&#39;s not great at all! Otherwise a lot of the food was very good.RESERVATIONS: Made online about a month in advance (dinner for 5 at 8pm).THE COST: $251.09 including tax/tip for dinner for five.* Pear Shiso, lacryma, campari ice cube, gin ($14) - 3.5 starsA nice drink! A tad strong, but the custom ice cube was a nice touch and I enjoyed the pear flavor.* SRF Beef Tartare ($16) - 4 starsGarnish was ok, but the beef was fresh and pretty amazing.* Brussels Sprouts ($13) - 4 starsLoved the flavor and the crunch!* Truffle Oil Fries ($7) - 3.5 starsGood, not amazing. A little dry.* Seared Scallops ($26) - 4 starsVery nice! Great all-around.* &#39;Har Gow&#39; Cavatelli, rock shrimp ($22) - 2.5 starsQuite an unfortunate dish. The pasta was too hard and this was lackluster in flavor.* Grilled Pork Ribs, hoisin bbq sauce ($19) - 3.5 starsGood but not amazing. The meat had good flavor but was a little dry.* Cheeseburger, potato bun ($15) - 3.5 starsSolid. Better than the fried duck!* Fried Duck Sandwich ($19) - 3 starsDefinitely not up to the rave reviews. The patty was dry &amp; flavorless, the bun also a little dry. My friends loved the slaw.* Panna Cotta ($11) - 4 starsThis was good and had interesting flavors! The slight bitterness of the chocolate cake was nice.* Milk Chocolate Ganache ($12) - 4 starsGood for those with a sweet tooth. The variety of textures worked really well.

Review is for Brunch only. Most Brunch spots with an established reputation do not take weekend brunch reservations so I was a bit taken back when my better half secured a prime brunch time time on a Sunday. As far as first impressions goes, upon walking in the layout and space oozed modern thoughtfulness and the large windows on the left emanated just enough light to create a cool relaxed vibe.I had heard good things about the Brioche French Toast and although it was on the small side portion wise, it was soft and yet had a pleasant chewy consistency and overall was solid but not spectacular. I was more impressed by the side of fruit(with mascarpone). Not only was the fruit fresh but the presentation scored high on the visually pleasing scale. Bringing out burnt toast was not so hot on the presentation scale.Our waitress was pleasant. I have to say that although I gave 1760 3 stars for my bunch experience, it&#39;s closer to 3.5 stars.

With a new chef in charge, my family and I thought it be worth trying 1760 againMy last visit was quite memorable and was hoping for another repeat experience. Suffice to say, the new changes did not live up to beforeKey differencesPortion size has shrunk for both the food and drinksExecution is about the sameCocktail remakes are sadly not as good as their predecessorsSalt level is much higher especially in the Har Gow Cavatelli (it did taste like the dim sum dish but too much salt)Most dishes straddled between Ok to slightly betterOverall ThoughtsWhile I am comparing and contrasting, if looking purely at what we had, the meal was truly Just A-OK

I met with an old friend here for brunch. She made reservations, but we probably didn&#39;t need them. I really loved the modern feel of the place with all the open windows and high ceiling. The server was accommodating and kept refilling our waters. She recommended ordering 2-3 entrees per person, so we decided to share the Little Gem Salad ($10), B.E.T. ($11), Truffle Fries ($6), and Croquette ($15). Everything was so beautifully presented and tasted just as great too! I would probably pass on the B.E.T. next time as it&#39;s only bacon, eggs and toast and really wasn&#39;t all too special --I don&#39;t know what I was thinking ordering that. Overall, a very chic spot, but can be pricey.

A great place for drinks and dinner. The ambiance is right on. The staff friendly. Started off with a glass of Oberon Cab Sav. The olives, beef tartare, sprouts and scallops were amazing. The pork belly and shrimp tagliatelle were good. It&#39;s a tapas, shared plate style dinner. They pace the dinner so you definitely don&#39;t feel rushed. An enjoyable dining experience. Definitely would come back for their signature drinks and desserts.

There is brunch bliss available in San Francisco without hour-long waits, and it&#39;s at 1760.I&#39;ve enjoyed about four dinners and three brunches at 1760, and they&#39;ve impressed me every single time. It&#39;s also nice to have a restaurant that isn&#39;t crazy expensive but serves top-notch (though typically expensive) cocktails.I have a few favorites that seem to consistently be on their menus:Little Gem Salad (dinner and brunch)Bavette Steak (dinner only)Rosemary Focaccia (dinner only)Buttermilk Biscuits (brunch only)Kimchi Fried Rice (brunch only)That said, I&#39;ve found any item on either brunch or dinner menus disappointing.1760 also has a remarkable happy hour (The Stirring Hour) with most cocktails at $8 and a limited selection of tapas-style items (all priced lower than the normal menus).

What is American (New) cuisine? It&#39;s such a vague and colloquial term. I associate it with the latest food trends, like avocado toast, for example. Since 1760&#39;s menu aims for variety &amp; seasonality and does not have a central theme, that explains why they are lumped into the American (New) category. I appreciate their brief single-page menu, organized from the lighter to heavier dishes, so naturally I gravitated towards the bottom half of the menu. As someone who thrives on variety, but is easily overwhelmed by too many options, this menu offers just enough options.It&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve been to 1760. Apparently the menu has changed quite a bit.The uni bucatini is no more. Some may be disappointed, but if you didn&#39;t get to try it, you&#39;re not missing much. The creamy sauce and the bread crumb topping were great. However, there wasn&#39;t that much uni in the pasta. Also, the texture of bucatini is a little too hard, for lack of a better word. In any case, there are plenty of other restaurants to visit for uni pasta.A couple of things have remained. They still serve a duck sandwich and the cocktails are great.The fried duck sandwich with slaw, pickles, &amp; spicy aioli is okay, but pretty pricey. I would have preferred chunks of duck meat instead of the duck patty. I don&#39;t particularly like slaw or shredded anything, so maybe this sandwich just wasn&#39;t for me. However, I did like creamy aioli and the thick bun, which sufficiently soaked up the juices of the sandwich.The sweet &amp; fresh-tasting scallops and the mushroom tempura were far more enjoyable. I would be interested in returning to try their beef tartare and sisig dishes.The cocktails are great, so if I were in the area, I&#39;d drop by for affordable drinks during their happy hour (5-6PM). However, the cocktails on the dinner menu look much more enticing, but are nearly double the price. The 1760 cocktail was pretty refreshing, and not too sweet. The Pear-Shiso &amp; Basil-Mezcal Sour sound pretty appealing too.The food was good, but I was a little more appreciative of the setting. The space seemed reminiscent of a former diner transformed into modern wine bar, and done quite well. The tall ceilings created the illusion of more space. There is a semi-exposed kitchen in the back. A sweeping long bar is somewhat separated from the rest of the dining room. The long cushioned bench with high back rest served as the partition to the bar. It was very comfortable, but I was a little paranoid that the people leaning against the divider, which was also the back of my seat, might spill drinks on my head, but it wasn&#39;t that sort of crowd, so I dismissed the thought.

1760 has gotten it right. It&#39;s not cheap but the food and cocktails are really tasty. There are so many other restaurants with this type of ambiance at this price point that fall short. To be honest, I had no expectations that 1760 would be any different.We started with cocktails and I ordered the refreshing and beautiful Pear Shiso. It was served in a tiny glass but it was so good that I didn&#39;t even care how small it was.The server told us to order 2-3 dishes per person and luckily, we were not very hungry so we ended up getting 3 items to share.We started with the Little Gem Salad. This is one of the best salads I&#39;ve ever had. The dressing had a nice kick of wasabi and the fried capers really made the dish special.Next, we had the Pork Sisig. It was visually pleasing, yet again, and had bold flavors. We were very pleased at this point.The only slight disappointment was the Duck Sandwich. It was a good value; at $19, it was perhaps the largest dish on the menu and the bread certainly filled us up. But it was one-dimensional and not worth all of the mentions in the Yelp reviews.We finished off our meal with the delicious Brown Butter Panna Cotta dessert. We debated whether it was truly a panna cotta. Whatever it was, it was addicting.2 cocktails, 3 dishes, and 1 dessert ended up being ~$110 with tax and tip. Not bad for SF.

I&#39;m a huge fan of this place! I love the dim atmosphere and intimate seating. The service is here is great and on point.Their menu is basically tapas style with an arrangement of fresh bites to good ol&#39; hardy dishes. The portions here are a bit small but can fill you up (depending). I recommend getting a couple dishes and sharing with each other or just getting a couple for yourself.I highly recommend starting off with their rosemary focaccia with baba ganoush spread. This has at the right amount of salt to it and strong flavor &amp; scent from the rosemary. Next, their &#39;Har Gow&#39; Cavatelli is phenomenal. The pasta is tossed and filled with tiny rock shrimp, garlic butter, and ginger. It&#39;s my favorite thing on the menu in fact. Their duck sandwich is ok; kind of tasted bland and like a veggie burger to be exact. I did love their fingerling potatoes because the charred avocado and cilantro gave so much flavor. The potatoes were cooked up perfectly!I also suggest grabbing some drinks off their menu. They have lots to offer and will satisfy your palate. For a great citrus-mint type drink for a quick refreshment, I recommend their 1760 house special cocktail. For a nice sweet drink to just take it easy on, I recommend their Falernum Sour which has egg white for texture and tiki bitters with pineapple! It&#39;s a great drink to cool off.

Hipster modern restaurant complete with bar stocked with whatever cocktail is trendy at the moment. I kid but it&#39;s kinda the feel of the place.I don&#39;t love the scene but the food was prepared beautifully with gorgeous presentation and tasted amazing. I went with a friend for dinner and it far exceeded my expectations. The food is served tapas style. The menu is succinct. The dishes were prepared with care. Every plate looked like a work of art and was delicious. To top it off, I had the best panna cotta of my life and for that I&#39;ll be forever grateful. Probably more ideal for a night out with friends.I would go again for the food and the panna cotta. I really want to check out their brunch menu. The crab fat congee and peach coconut mimosa sounds and looks heavenly.

Love this place for brunch, and can&#39;t wait to come back and try it out for dinner some time.The SO and I were looking for a brunch spot around noonish on Sunday and didn&#39;t want to brave any long lines; 1760 came up on Opentable as an option for a reservation within the next 30 minutes, and since this was within walking distance, we decided to give it a try. I didn&#39;t realize it was an offshoot of Acquerello until I read I saw its tag line on Google Maps, but once we knew it was related to that, we had some high expectations.The place was actually pretty empty around noon, so this is definitely a viable future brunch option if you&#39;re willing to spend just a little bit more. It&#39;s got a nice clean interior--very simple and almost raw at times (bare concrete floors), silverware comes in a cool carved wooden box, etc.We got:Chicken and waffle croquettes: These were awesome. They&#39;re glazed in a maple syrup -- they were super soft and had a great balance between sweet and savory, and were just a delight to eat.Biscuits: Also delicious. The SO was not as impressed, but I&#39;ve never been served little biscuits with some maple flavored butter and some jam -- I thought the flavors complemented the warm biscuit well, the SO thought that the flavor was a little too subtle, but I was pretty pleased with execution.Crab fat congee: this was what really impressed me, and this is probably what&#39;s going to convince me to come back and try again. I was a little nervous about their attempt at Asian fusion, but they killed it. They got the texture of the congee to be pretty right, the choice to flavor it with crab fat and heirloom tomatos and corn definitely added an interesting fusion component. The crispy pork was a nice flavorful addition and also added some nuance and texture to the dish, and the runny egg was a nice touch as well. This easily sealed the deal for me.They also have a really nice mixture of cocktails and drinks, and you can make mimosas with a number of juices! (pear juice is quite good).Food itself was about $35, so the price is actually quite reasonable given the high quality of the meal itself. Anyways, overall, highly recommend this place, and can&#39;t wait to give dinner a try!tldr; underrated brunch spot, v good and affordable high quality brunch food, can definitely see myself frequenting this place in the future

My boyfriend took me here for a nice date night. Our reservation was at 8pm but we were running late so we called in and learned that they can&#39;t hold the reservation more than 10 mins so we had to cancel. Someone just happened to cancel their 8:45pm reservation so we took their spot :)The server told us this place is family style and recommend each person to order 2-3 dishes. Here is what we ordered:Avocado Toast (4/5): Pretty good. I liked the addition of the lime. I mean its hard to mess this one up. I did like the fact that the toast was made from scratch.Hamachi Crudo (3/5): Came with 4 small slices of hamachi. It was topped with lemon, mango, and cucumber. The sauce had a nice kick of spice. The fish itself wasn&#39;t as soft as I expected; It didn&#39;t have that &#39;melts in your mouth&#39; factor that I was looking for.Lobster Risotto (5/5): Our favorite dish of the night. Super yummy with a generous amount of lobster meat.Fried Duck Sandwich (2/5): Really disappointed at this dish. I really don&#39;t get why people rave about this dish so much. I wish they used actual slices of duck meat instead of a patty. The patty didn&#39;t even taste like duck.Grilled Pork Ribs (4/5): The ribs were very tender. The sauce was okay. Nothing special in terms of flavor.Milk Chocolate Ganache (5/5): Served with hickory ice cream, bourbon caramel, marshmallow. WE LOVED EVERYTHING ON THE PLATE! It was the perfect ending to our meal.

I came here for dinner with my family and it was a hit! It&#39;s pretty difficult for me to find something that pleases everyone (picky eaters, huge appetites, etc.) but we were very happy with our meal at 1760.Our dishes:- lobster bisque- mushroom tempura- avocado toast- chicken and waffle croquettes- Brussels sprouts- paccheri- pork sisig- Bavette steak- grilled pork ribs- intermezzo- honey panna cotta- macapuno- milk chocolate ganacheThe servings were a bit on the small side but that allowed us to try more things. I really liked the mushroom tempura, the paccheri, and the grilled pork ribs.We also ordered one of each dessert to try. Unfortunately, while they were plated very well, the flavors didn&#39;t match the level of quality of the savory dishes. The intermezzo was probably the best dessert. The milk chocolate ganache was too rich (and broke apart once the server set it on the table! :c so sad).I will definitely come back to try the other dishes - I hear the breads are very good - but will pass on dessert next time.

This place is really excellent. One of the best places I&#39;ve tried lately. Definitely left me with a great impression and stands out from all the other over-priced and mediocre brunch places in SF (the ones with the long lines like Ella&#39;s and Mama&#39;s and Brenda&#39;s. Nothing but glorified American hot breakfast you can cook at home for a fraction of the price). This place doesn&#39;t open until 11AM on the weekends, FYI.We had the mushroom tempura, crab congee, pork belly fried rice, rock shrimp, and the beignets. The the crab congee and the mushroom tempura (surprisingly) are my favorites. Everything from the presentation of the food, the uniqueness of the flavors, and the service are top-notch. I&#39;m eager to come back and try their dinner menu.If you want finer dining for brunch without the over-crowdedness, hectic long lines, and slummy atmosphere just to eat bacon and eggs, definitely come here.

1760 always seemed busy and trendy, so we decided to give it a try. We had a reservation for two at 9pm on a Friday via OpenTable.We ordered a number of the recommended items - 1760 and Fig Strawberry, both were delicious cocktails, though I&#39;d say they were pricey at $14 each.For food, we ordered several of the recommended items - the lobster bisque, SRF beef tartare, and Corn-Coconut Ravioli. (Skipped on the duck sandwich since we didn&#39;t want anything too oily).We actually misread lobster bisque for the famous lobster ceviche, which is no longer on the menu. The lobster bisque was a soup that went down in 1-2 gulps, for a whopping $6 each. It was delicious, though the portion size was disappointing. The beef tartare was more like a salad, which was interesting and well paired with herbs, though again, was a small portion size (priced at $16). The ravioli was very good, though I&#39;ve always been a fan of Thai curry. Unfortunately this dish was again a very small portion size (priced at $18).We decided to order another main since we were still hungry, the Paccheri (octopus) which was surprisingly in a pasta format. This dish was actually a decent portion size, but unfortunately the tomato paste sauce overpowered the octopus (it was priced at $23).We did get a free dessert since we were celebrating a birthday (the Intermezzo sorbet), which was a nice gesture.The service was very good overall and the decor creates a more casual vibe. It&#39;s a great hangout spot, but we probably won&#39;t be coming back anytime soon since nothing particularly stood out, though I did really enjoy the corn-coconut ravioli.

Feed me.Are usually the words that come out of my mouth right after a short, but strenuous work out at Core40. As I get older, I realize that I have to put in more work to maintain the figure. Damn you yelp!My fellow yelper in crime, Cat C., made rezzies for brunch even though it wasn&#39;t necessary (dinner is another story) because we don&#39;t like waiting. (part of the getting older thing) 1760 is a wonderful brunch addition to the Polk st. scene since this stretch is severely lacking exciting brunch options.The french toast must&#39;ve spent some time soaking in vanilla and Cointreau since it was robustly flavorful. I loved that it was light, yet substantial. Berries topped the thick brioche and added a natural sweetness to the dish.My rock shrimp with polenta was TO DIE FOR. Simply prepared with hoisin and lime, the flavors really come together and the crunchy soft chicharonnes was a dead giveaway that there&#39;s a Filipino chef in the house. Holla, kababayan! =) My only complaint is it&#39;s too darn pricey for a very small portion.If you happen to visit in the evening even just for drinks, cocktails are on point. I&#39;ve tried their Basil Mezcal sour (kaffir lime, egg white, mezcal) and The 1760 (mint, cumin, mezcal, tonic, gin) and I love that they aren&#39;t afraid to use a lot of spices in their creations. Cardamom, cumin, garam masala are a common sight on the list, so don&#39;t hesitate to order a flavor profile mix that you&#39;ve never tried before, it&#39;ll be a unique experience.1760 is a casual dining destination in the Russian Hill neighborhood that&#39;s filled with locals. Quieter at brunch, but more exciting for drinks and dinner. Either way, it sure is a winner.

1760 is the exciting sister to Acquerello. It did not disappoint! It was Friday and I was fresh back from 2 years in hell....namely the suburbs of DC.....the dreaded DMV! I wanted to celebrate some great news and an exciting week so I looked thru my bookmarks and asked Acquerello to shoehorn me in, knowing it was an abject &#34;negativo&#34;. They recommended 1760 and the reviews were, in a word, &#34;tasty!&#34;The vibe is casual but cool....the tunes nice, the ambience great and the service absolutely top-notch. We had several great dishes which are sort of tapas in nature, the &#34;tempura&#34;, scallops (perfectly cooked), and a super-yummo macapuno dessert along with the star, two tasty cocktails (happy hour) and the brilliant recommendation of the sommelier, a great CabSav from the Alexander Valley. All in all, we had a delightful time.just a note: our waitress had an unusually flat affect which was a little unnerving but the food, beverages and other service people made up for it, as well as the beauty of the setting inside!Definitely going back

Was going to give it a 3 stars due to the okay food, but the service is very good so a +1.My waitress Kim Thi was very nice and describe to me how to menu of the restaurant works. The food volume increases as you do down the list, wish they had this recommendation part of the menu for which drinks are good paired with the meal.Started with her recommendation of the sushi. It tasted very clean and fresh. The sauce pairing they put on the side to dip with the fish was very refreshing. I would recommend getting this.I had the fried duck sandwich. Honestly, this sucked. It tasted like a patty that was made out of beans and just had to send it back. $20.In return I had the pork ribs. It was close to falling off the bone ribs but I think the sauce overshadowed the meat. It had this Thai sauce that well with the pork ribs. It was quite salty as well. $20 for like 4-6 pieces

The cutest brunch place! Came here with 8 friends for a boozy brunch reunion and it was so great! Totally hip and modern upscale atmosphere for decently affordable prices. At $10-20 per plate, we got half the things on the brunch menu and were able to share - I definitely recommend the congee. Everything on the menu definitely sounds a little different at first, but everything I sampled from my friends&#39; plates were fantastic. Our waiter was great, attentive, but not too attentive, and was very patient with helping us weigh out our options on the menu.To top it all off, they had pitchers of mimosas with different flavors of fruit juices to mix it with! Instead of getting the traditional OJ mimosa, we got it with grapefruit juice and it was so delicious!Next time I&#39;m in the city for brunch (or another meal) I&#39;ll definitely have this on my list of favorite places to go :)

Awesome foodie spot with a great selection of small plates in a fun upbeat atmosphere. I highly recommend the Hamachi Crudo (it&#39;s a little on the spicy side), Bavette Steak (medium rare will melt in your mouth) and the seared scallops are amaze! If you&#39;re going veggie, you can&#39;t go wrong with the Little Gem Salad. 1760 is also a great place to stop by for a drink at their bar.

The food scene in SF is lacking and pretty much a lot of restaurants I&#39;ve tried, especially 4+ star places on Yelp, were very underwhelming and lacking in taste and variety so I had low expectations coming in and boy was I pleasantly surprised.My boyfriend made a reservation for 9pm on a Friday and it was still packed and lively. Here is what we ordered:1) Hamachi Crudo - Four slices of hamachi soaked in a delicious white soy sauce and oil. The sauce was so good that I soaked as much as I could with the fish and then dipped my spoon in just to finish up the sauce (yes, that&#39;s what I did!). The best way to eat this dish is not with a fork but with a spoon so you can scoop up more of the sauce when you eat the fish.2) Sea Scallops - Only comes with four scallops but definitely quality over quantity with this dish. The scallops had a perfect, flavorful char on it that was cooked just right and therefore, did not come out rubbery. The best scallops I&#39;ve had to date. The rainbow chard was tangy and was a nice balance to the flavor of the scallops. Eat the scallops with all the cauliflower puree! I don&#39;t like cauliflower but there was no hint of the actual taste of the veggie in this puree.3) Fried Duck Sandwich - I expected the duck to some out completely fried but only the outside was lightly fried and the inside left to remain moist and bursting with delectable flavors. The spicy aioli gave it a nice creamy flavor and texture to the duck. Definitely the most filling dish.4) Lobster Risotto - My least favorite dish. The rice was a little too al dente to my liking and tasted just okay with no variety of flavor like the previous dishes. I&#39;ve had better risotto at Ruth Chris and Gary Danko. However, it did had a generous amount of lobster and for $32 it better have!!Overall, AMAZING food, great atmosphere and ambience, and attentive service. This would be the third restaurant (along with Ono seafood in Oahu and Gary Danko) that would rate 5/5 stars.

After pouring over multiple restaurants finally decided to come here. Parking is a little tough in this area but worth it if you plan on spending a night out. Unfortunately, I was a little disappointed with my meal. I had done some research and had my mind set on ordering a few things, but they didn&#39;t have the lobster ceviche or grilled octopus I had wanted. This is what we got:Hamachi crudo 4/5: decent sized piece of hamachi but not as soft as I had hoped. Wasn&#39;t that impressed.Seared scallops: 3.5/5. Beautiful plating and good sear on the scallops but overlooked a little.Cavatelli: 2/5. Got this after reading a couple of reviews and it was one of the few bigger dishes on the menu. Super disappointed. This was pretty much just like pasta in cream of mushroom soup.Beef short ribs: 5/5. They melted in your mouth. One of my favorite dishes of the night.Duck burger: 5/5 I was hesitant about this because so many people raved about it in the reviews and it lived up to the hype. Another decent sized serving and loved the spicy cole slaw.Overall, one time is probably enough of this place. Good to try, but not a place to continuously return based on the food. Staff was great and super attentive!

I got the gilt city brunch special for two. We got the beignets, the rock shrimp polenta, the French toast and maple bacon. The beignets were pretty good, although I think they out too much sugar on them. The rock shrimp polenta is a pretty small entree and I thought the shrimp didn&#39;t taste all that fresh and was over seasoned.I was pretty disappointed with the place and now I&#39;m not sure if I would come here for dinner.

Finally got to try this place since it opened 3 years ago. I probably shouldn&#39;t have waited this long since I picked out what I wanted from the menu since their opening and now the menu has changed, I was quite disappointed I didn&#39;t get to try their corn ravioli and the squash blossom. With a disappointed heart, I tried to be open and order something else, but at that point...my appetite has turned bias.For a party of two, we made a reservation 3 weeks in advance (I was determined to try this place once and for all!). Parking was surprisingly easy for that particular Saturday night, but only street parking is available. Seating was a breeze since we had the reservation, but it does seem like the restaurant is packed so expect to wait if you&#39;re a walk in party.What we ordered:Lobster Bisque - 3/5 stars: individual sized (espresso shot), my husband said it didn&#39;t have enough lobster essence assuming it was be very concentrated since it&#39;s such a small cup. However there was a small piece of lobster in there.Mushroom Tempura - 4/5 stars: light and fragrant, easy to eat and almost didn&#39;t want to share.Brussel Sprouts - 3.5/5 stars: pack with flavors. Love how it&#39;s paired with some sunflower seeds for a bit of texture. The slight bitterness from the brussel sprouts and the honey was infused perfectly. However, it starts to feel overly salted if indulged.The infamous duck burger - 3/5 stars: didn&#39;t live up to the hype. It was good, but I don&#39;t see the reason behind it&#39;s staple of the menu.Not a great place for party over 6 people. Best to visit with a group of 2-4.

My husband and I were visiting from L.A. and decided to stop by 1760 for a &#34;quick bite and a drink&#34;. We were immediately in love with the great ambience and vibe of the place as soon as we walked in the door.The food was excellent, the cocktails were superb and the mixologists were incredibly knowledgable, outgoing and genuinely friendly. The variety on the menu was so appetizing that our &#34;small snack&#34; turned into the Sunchoke Soup Shot, Hamachi Crudo, Beef Tartare and Brussel Sprouts. I highly recommend them all.To top it off, the cocktails were insanely delicious and the mixologists behind the bar took the time to not only recommend different drinks, but also break down the different ingredients and concepts behind each drink. You don&#39;t get that type of service and friendliness anywhere nowadays. Needless to say our &#34;quick bite and drink&#34; turned into staying the entirety of the evening, until last call.GO TO 1760. YOU WONT REGRET IT.

Very trendy and posh cocktail and tapas spot. Definitely high-priced but everything I&#39;ve tried is absolutely delicious. Try brunch for a casual atmosphere with little wait.Ambiance is very modern and hipster from the bar to the bathroom. I would like the designer to decorate my next apartment...although might be out of my price range.

I was in San Francisco for a get-together with my close friends from college. Having read excellent things about this place, we excitedly booked seating exactly a month in advance (FYI, the restaurant does not accept earlier reservations than that). I&#39;m so glad we were able to secure one as this was by far the best overall meal I had as well as one of the absolute highlights of my entire trip!There were three of us in the group, and we shared six dishes plus one dessert. They were ALL phenomenal. I loved every single dish, and this rarely happens. We ordered the steak tartare, brussel sprouts, cavatelli, pork ribs, poppy seed bread with lavender honey butter (one of the best bread/bread combos I&#39;ve had in my entire life), fried duck sandwich (a real standout dish) and honey panna cotta. Not only were all the items delicious and well-balanced, but they were beautiful to behold as well.1760 is a great place to go with friends since the food is served family style and is meant to be shared. There really wasn&#39;t a single misstep in the evening - I just look forward to visiting again!

While I normally feel cheated by the minuscule portions at tapas places, 1760 was great!It&#39;s one of those sophisticated, modern joints that work well for dates or small groups. They have nice, comfy booths that accommodate up to four. Slightly dressy atmosphere, but I came in yoga attire and didn&#39;t feel too out of place.The food was great, albeit a touch overpriced. Like most tapa restaurants, each person is supposed to order 2-3 dishes. My group of 3 ordered 6 dishes and that was the right amount of food, leaving us satisfied but not stuffed.Would order again:+ Cavatelli with mushrooms and charred broccolini (loved the combination)+ Fried duck sandwich (duh!)+ Fingerling potatoes with charred avocado and roasted peanuts (addicting)+ Mushroom tempura+ Pork sisigPass:+ Grilled pork ribs, as they were too spicy for me and nothing special.Overall, a solid choice for dinner. I&#39;ll give brunch a shot to try the crab fat congee!

Ever since 1760 opened on Polk, I was never able to grab a table. Every time I walked by, it was super packed, and I was never patient enough to wait.I made reservations easily on a Wednesday evening at 7. The restaurant was nearly empty, so accordingly, the wait staff was very attentive.1) A waitress brought over a complimentary starter - apple slices with some sort of sweet puree on top that was delicious and refreshing. It was a nice surprise, and probably tasted better because it was free ;)2) I started off by ordering this poppy sticky bread with lavender butter to start. This was good, but nothing to write home about. It&#39;s a perfect size to share for 3 people, though, and it keeps you from over-eating!3) Corn-Coconut Ravioli was up next. So good! There were six raviolis in total, so it was easy to share between three people. The flavour was unique, and not a bad Asian-fusion combo.4) Seared Scallops were delicious but some were overcooked. STILL GOOD THOUGH.5) Grilled Pork Ribs with Hoison BBQ sauce was our last savory dish. I don&#39;t usually like pork or go for ribs, but this was bombbbb. It was spicy and even our friend who doesn&#39;t like spicy food enjoyed it.6) Honey Panna Cotta - you know when you think that the dessert won&#39;t taste as good because you&#39;re already full? THIS WAS NOT THE CASE. The portion size for this was oddly large compared to everything else. It was probably the best bang for your buck. It was also a nice size to split between 3 people. I would come back to 1760 just to order this.Everything menu seems over priced, but when I really think about portion control and how much I should be eating, it is the perfect amount.Between three people and many &#34;courses,&#34; we were full and not weighed down; and our bill came out to ~$100.

1760...doesn&#39;t belong in 2015.First of all, skip the duck burger. It&#39;s really not that great. The patty is not sliced duck breast. It&#39;s mushed up duck meat of some sort. Almost like a mushy chicken salad, minus the mayonnaise.The drinks were okay, nothing to rave about.The best thing about this place was the waiter. He was attentive and funny!

1760 - come hungry! Leave starved! What a joke. My gf usually loves these tapas style venues (I see them for what they are: serve less charge more). The avocado toast is something I could make while running out the door in the morning. The pork sisig was so so. The ravioli was great but the quantity couldn&#39;t satisfy a gerbil. We got excited when they brought out the fried duck sandwich because it actually looked like a sandwich, but alas it was another textbook example of a chef hoping to push the boundaries of culinary exploration when in reality they just created something that couldn&#39;t hold a candle to a plain and simple In-N-Out burger. The only way places like this continue to exist is because the &#34;cosmopolitan&#34; urbanites of San Francisco have their heads pushed so far up their asses that they can&#39;t tell the difference between good food and kitty litter.

Loved this place for dinner, and loved this place brunch, and loved this place for not as ridiculously crowded as Nopa (2 places are pretty similar in many ways!).We got 3 things to share for brunch: mushroom tempura, black eyed jack with quail eggs, and crab roe congee. Also got 2 cocktails, one was with absinthe that&#39;s so creamy and nice, the other was the 1760 with mezcal, yum!The mushroom tempura was fried to perfection, great flavor a and textures with the creamy grits.The quail toasted was fun and tasty and not too heavy.The congee had great consistency, creamy and flavorful. Love he poached egg in the middle. Didn&#39;t love the flavor a of tomato, doesn&#39;t go well with the subtle crab flavor.1760 also served some amazing dishes for dinner, the lobster ceviche was to die for, and the ribs were great.

Place I would&#39;ve never heard of if not for yelp and it was SF fantastic. 4.5 starsFood: 4.5, Service: 4, Atmosphere: 4.5Cost to worth it rating: 3 (plates $10-$24)Return worthiness: yesHighlights:- Pork ribs: fave dish of the night. Spicy and tangy thick BBQ sauce, lime, and pile of peanuts topped these succulent tender ribs. Makes my top ribs list. 5 stars.- Hamachi: with chili slices and yuzu gelee. Legit quality sashimi slices and lovely plating. 5 stars.- Coconut curry corn ravioli: Liked the sweet corn and Thai flavors and beautiful presentation. 4.5 stars- Mushroom tempura: lightly breaded with foam to play off the airy-ness. 4 stars.- Fried duck sandwich: pretty tasty but a bit on the dry side and I liked another dishes better. 3.5 stars- Sharing: small plates stly- Cocktails: interesting concoctions like a coconut pineapple kaffir lime rum one or an indian spiced masala cardamom bourbon- Atmosphere: speaks San Francisco dining to me. Nice open room with lots of energy, wood bar along the side, friendly waiters who take pride in their food and drink, and comfortable seating with a set of small setups of either booths or tables.Lowlights:- If you&#39;re dine commuting into the city it&#39;s a 1.5 mile walk from Bart so more of an uber localeLoved my spontaneous dinner date here with a friend and would come back with my hub and try some more menu items.

Came here as a walk-in with a party of four and got seated immediately around 945pm on a Saturday night - super accommodating! Sat at the communal table with hooks beneath them to hold our jackets and purses - very convenient. The waiter was super friendly and helpful with recommendations. We all liked the dishes we were served, except the portions were a bit small but we left satisfied and not overly full.We started off with beers all around - the white ale and trumer Pilsner were good. The white ale tasted very pretty! And we also tried the red rice ale which was very interesting as well - nothing like we have tried before but a good beer choice as well. We then got a complimentary egg salad on top of a chip for starters before our appetizers and it was delicious but the chip tasted like something we bought from the grocery store.-Lobster bisque: we were all a huge fan of this dish! delicious soft lobster bits and the creamy soup wasn&#39;t too thick like usual lobster bisques I&#39;ve had are but he perfect texture - $6 per person and it&#39;s fairly small but delicious!- Beef tartare: came with nut pieces, Apple pieces and mint leaves. All tasted very delicious together, the top part of the tartare when first served is bit salty so mix it around before diving in; would definitely order again!- Brussels sprouts: usually a huge fan of Brussels sprouts so I had to order and it didn&#39;t let us down. There were full pieces and crispy pieces (my favorite) with a strong sauce on top which was a tad bit overpowering but the texture of the Brussels sprouts were perfect.- Paccheri: similar to a pasta dish but with octopus pieces. I liked this entree best - rich in tomato flavor and soft pasta pieces; would order again!- Cavatelli: little shell pieces that were chewy but a bit hard (which I didn&#39;t like) but it came with mushroom fennel and was a bit bland next to the Paccheri. Probably won&#39;t order again.- Baby back ribs: came with five pieces which were so soft that they fell off the bone. The but pieces on top was a good texture combination to give it a crunch with the soft ribs. However I&#39;m not a huge fan of bbq items so it was alright to me. It was also a bit spicy.- Duck Sandwich: not as good as I expected it to be. The duck meat was soft but not rich in flavor at all - almost tasteless. Probably won&#39;t order again.- Macapuno: dessert was delicious! Loved the ube and coconut uber with soft cake under ganache :) would definitely order this again! Very good end to our meal.- Chai-Horchata: my friend ordered this and the Cognac in the hot drink was so strong in scent and taste that we didn&#39;t finish but if you&#39;re a fan of cognac, youd probably like it but we weren&#39;t a fan.Overall, would definitely come again if you want to splurge on a good meal! Service was great, along with beers and dishes!

This place had great drinks. Great drinks. My blueberry sage cocktail was DELICIOUS. The ambiance is also very nice.The food was mostly meh and overpriced to me. We ordered a plate of stuffed olives, which was basically the green olives with the pepper in them that you can buy in any grocery store. We spent $8 on olives that we could have gotten in a large jar from the store for $3. Lame. They could have at least had one type of olive that was stuffed with feta or something! The duck burger was really strange. Duck is usually served sweet to offset the greasiness of the meat, and the sauerkraut was not a good addition. The sandwich dripped, fell apart, and was unappetizing. It did not form a comprehensive dish. The heirloom tomatoes were good, however, how difficult is it to cut up some tomatoes and pour balsamic on them?Seriously overpriced, mediocre food.Just come here for the drinks.

All dishes were tasty enough, but nothing was memorable to me. I&#39;ve been here twice, and the second time I didn&#39;t even realize I&#39;ve been already (within the year). I think the problem with this restaurant is not the food, but not having a signature item that makes it easier for people to remember.

3.5 for 1760Our meal at 1760 did not live up to the hype, but the overall experience was very good. My mother and I came here for a ladies night, and I was very excited to order all of the items that friends had recommended. The cocktail list was very impressive and we both really enjoyed our drinks.We ordered the squash blossom tempura, which was fantastic. It&#39;s hard to find squash blossoms on menus, so I always order them when I can. I&#39;m not sure what they made the foam out of, but it was overpowering and left a bitter unpleasant taste in my mouth. The lobster ceviche (which everyone said was a must), was the most disappointing. The coconut sauce was yummy but didn&#39;t pair well with the lobster. The lobster ceviche itself seemed to have a lot in it besides lobster, which was a bit of a bummer. The crispy octopus was good, but a tad too burnt-tasting. The star dish of the night was definitely the cavatelli; the pasta was clearly made in-house and the mushrooms added such a rich, delicious flavor.The vibe in the restaurant was pretty good. It was definitely louder than expected, seeing how close all of the tables were to each other. Our server was on the cold side, overall a fun time. I do think that if I had gone in blind (so to speak), I would have enjoyed the food more, but it&#39;s been so hyped up, I expected everything to blow my mind.

Really underwhelming plates, especially for a group setting. Food is served tapas-style and for a group of 3 it was suggested we order 5 dishes.Not only were a few plates of over-verbalized potatoes and asparagus trees served to us slowly one dish at a time, nothing ever quelled our hunger. We got burgers afterwards.Cocktails were creative and tasty and the wine selection was decent as well. That earns at least 2 stars

Good dinner and drinks spot in Nob Hill. Wait staff is fantastic - friendly, fast, and attentive. They were really nice with tasting wines before a full pour and on the spot with recommendations.The best single item was the squash blossom done tempura style. The foam it comes with tastes like uni and has amazing umami profile.The poppy seed pain de mie was exquisite. One of the top breads at a restaurant. The focaccia was forgettable and a waste for paid bread.The Corn-Coconut Ravioli was tasty and light. I&#39;d get again.The pork sisig was a refined version of the Filipino dish but ultimately disappointing.The Calamarata Pasta had a nice kick but was also didn&#39;t have us wishing for more. It was a spicy tomato pasta with calamari but didn&#39;t become more than the sum of the parts.

I really want to like this place. I mean I REALLY do. The better part of my 20 years in San Francisco, this part of Polk Street has been my &#39;hood. But it has never had especially good high end(&#39;ish) food. So I was happy when 1760 (related to the insane (2) Michelin-starred Acquerello) moved in -- I KNEW this was what I was waiting for...But, I left both of my visits underwhelmed. With such a beautiful menu, with such impressive ingredients, with its Acquerello provenance, how could this not come together?! But nothing did -- despite the great ingredients, the flavors never seem to work together. And in this age of increasingly impressive presentation, the dishes all looked a little &#39;muddy&#39; and just thrown together. (I am the king of &#39;food porn&#39; photos, and not even I could make this stuff look good.)My experiences:Crispy Octopus w/ carrot-tamarind, cauliflower, chicken skin -- Flavors, meh. Octopus, dry.Baby artichokes w/ pistachio, orange and basil -- Bland, boring &#34;salad&#34; that looked like it was just shot out of a Salad Shooter.Beef Tartare w/ marcona almonds, herbs, Thai vinaigrette -- I almost always order the steak tartare when on a menu, but this left me underwhelmed -- merely barely seasoned raw meat with a little Thai essence.Bucatini (perfectly al dente) with uni (creamy!), garlic, red pepper and bread crumbs -- My best experience, but sadly, just one for four on the food wins.I have never had any of their cocktails, but it looks like a great menu. Their wine selection is top notch, and on both visits, the bartender made great recommendations. Sadly though, on my final visit, I found myself without wine and just a little remaining bit of my bucatini. I asked if I might have a half-glass to finish my meal off. Response: &#34;Sorry. We do not do that.&#34; Yes, a small nit. But very disappointing for a restaurant of this caliber. Looks like the service is on par with the food -- looks good on paper, but just does not come together...Sorry for the 2-star (rare for me), but with high hype comes high expectations.Maybe I should try brunch?

The lobster ceviche was the worst ever with the pieces being too small and the flavor drenched in some overly sweet yogurt sauce. Would almost want to guess that they got a bad batch of lobster and tried to salvage it by cutting it to shreds so it wouldn&#39;t be recognizable. They also forgot to add any lime for acidity. The octopus was surprisingly good, moist and interesting in flavor. The wine selections are okay. The servers are friendly. If you bring a heavy coat, they&#39;ll put it in the coat rack for you. The overall vibe isn&#39;t very unique or interesting. Think they need a new chef with some vision to ramp things up.

Good ambiance. A good date spot. Went with a girlfriend and shared 4 dishes. Nothing stood out in particular and I left feeling uninspired. Food isn&#39;t bad -- just not amazing to justify the price point. Overhyped in my opinion.Started off with their brussels sprouts -- loved the hazelnuts sprinkled throughout. The balsamic sauce was delicious. Then we had the steak tartare, which had chili, fresh basil, mint, and cilantro, and some Japanese seasoning salt. Unusual combo but it was good. Loved the kabocha ravioli in coconut broth and pepitas. This was my favorite dish. I sprinkled a bit of rock salt and it really brought out the flavors. We had the fried duck sandwich, which was really greasy and heavy. It was good, but I didn&#39;t get much of the duck flavor because it was overpowered by the sauce and slaw. We finished off the meal with their green tea dessert, which was awesome. It was like a deconstructed white chocolate raspberry almond cake with green tea ice cream. It was light and clean.Overall, I thought the food was beautiful and well balanced. Nothing really WOWed me except for the prices. Their portions are small. The service was good except at the end, the hostess rushed us out, maybe 10 minutes after we received our bill, saying people need to be seated.. Really? Never had that happen to me at a nice restaurant like this..I&#39;d prefer to spend my money at Frances or Bar Tartine next time.Tldr: good but not amazing food, fancy presentation, creative dishes, overpriced... Go if you want to impress your date but be prepared to shell out some serious cash.

I would have given this place 5 stars but I&#39;m not because (1) Our waitress was lowkey rude/sassy and made my friend I feel slightly burdensome to her (2) Lack of vegetarian optionsOther than that, both my friend and I loved our dinner here. We ordered the corn cheese ravioli, both the breads, shishito peppers and the roasted potatoes. I would give all the items a 5/5 except for the ravioli, I&#39;d give that a 3/5. It was just way too expensive and not that good.I love the decor, it seems like a hip &amp; fancy place, but people were straight up wearing sneakers and flannel so I guess the motto is, you do you.One day when I&#39;m making money, I would love to come back here again

Great place: spacey, high ceilings, soothing wall coloring, large tables, very clean restroom. Our server was funny too (sorry I&#39;m horrible with names) he had lots of patience while we took a long time to order our five blood marys. We ordered a bunch of plates to share: French Toast, Charcuterie board, Kim Chee fried rice, Pork Belly Porridge and Flatbread. Enough food to get us nice and full.

Mediocre. I had higher expectations but I was definitely disappointed. The lobster ceviche...interesting with the lemon grass and coconut flavors..I liked it but I didn&#39;t love it. It was different. Moving on...The crispy octopus....failed. Tastes like burnt dried meat. Flavors were not too bad but texture was terrible...so over cooked that I wouldn&#39;t have been able to even tell if that was octopus or not. Also had the infamous fried duck sandwich...well...not much to say here...buns were dry and hard, wouldn&#39;t have been able to tell that it was duck if I wasn&#39;t informed priorTo top it of...the only cabernet offered by the glass was $17. Really? That&#39;s above and beyond.Nothing special here really. Cool decor and atmosphere tho. Nice place to visit and catch up.

I&#39;m known for over ordering. So when two people who over order get together, it can be a dangerous combo. Welcome to Thursday night at 1760 with me and Peter L!Drinks:*Old fashioned 17: wild turkey 81 rye, campari, jelenik fernet, fee bros orange bitters, angostura ($12)*The 1760: mint, cumin, mezcal, tonic, gin ($12)*Domaine tempier, bandol 2011 ($78)*Faust, cabernet sauvignon napa valley 2012 ($58 for 375ml)*Enrico gatti grappa di moscato ($10)*Americano ($3)Drinks were very good. I enjoyed the cocktails. Plus they were donating $2 per Old Fashioned to the SF-Marin food bank. A good cause. I really enjoyed the Faust cabernet sauvignon. The half bottle wasn&#39;t on the menu, but our sommelier suggested it. It was perfect for my palate! Full bodied and bold.Food:*Caviar: hokkaido scallop tartare, uni, chive ($8)*Hamachi crudo: nori, yuzu kosho, avocado, daikon ($6)*Lobster ceviche: caramelized coconut, pineapple, kaffir lime ($17)*Burrata: grilled bread, sweet peppers, spearmint (anchovy &#39;bagna cauda&#39; on side) $14*Uni: bucatini, garlic, red pepper, bread crumb ($22)*Crispy octopus: chorizo &#39;paella&#39;, lemon-mussel ($22)*Bbq pork belly: corn porridge, charred frisee ($23)*Hanger steak: carrot-serrano, pearl onions ($28)*Strawberry &amp; cream bavarian: lemon basil gelato, basil sponge cake ($10)So. Much. Food. But good food it was! I enjoyed the Caviar &amp; Hamachi crudo very much! They really are just small bites and made for one person. But since we ordered so many dishes, I was fine having a tiny bite of each. The Uni bucatini is a must order! The creamy, briny, sweet, oceany uni went well with the bread crumbs. If I wasn&#39;t so full eating all our other dishes, I could have definitely finished this all by myself. I love uni! And finally, our dessert offered a nice sweet treat at the end. And very refreshing due to the lemon and basil.So after three hours, nine courses and lots of drinks, 1760 and I parted ways. Our server and sommelier were both great and super helpful. I would definitely come back for their Caviar, Hamachi crudo &amp; Uni bucatini. Yum!

You know you&#39;ve hit the jackpot when you find yourself involuntarily smiling between bites of food and barely stopping yourself from licking your plate clean. Really amazing experience from start to finish--all the complex flavors and ingredients you&#39;d expect from a place like SPQR, but without the crazy price tag or overly intricate, half-a-bite-sized servings. Plus NOPA-like ambiance and specialty cocktails without needing reservations a month in advance!Our picks for 2 people:- Fig-strawberry bourbon cocktail- Blood orange-rosemary rye cocktail- Shishito peppers- Cavatelli- Fried duck sandwich- Brussels sproutsThe shishito peppers and brussels sprouts were especially over-the-top flavorful and unique, and in hearty-sized portions as well. I&#39;ve never had duck before and was a little intimidated, but the fried duck sandwich was perfectly crispy, fatty, and felt like a very delicate, upscale hamburger. If I come back again I&#39;d re-order everything but the cavatelli, but that&#39;s only because I saw so many other dishes floating around that I wanted to try!Service was perfect -- not too heavy-handed with the recommendations, but made sure to bring out our meal in complementary pieces -- peppers and cavatelli first, then fried duck and brussels sprouts second. The table next to us seemed to be upset over the whole &#34;family style&#34; concept and dishes being brought out at different times, but they were treated with a complimentary dessert and &#34;late&#34; dishes taken off the tab, and I overheard them mention that they felt bad for complaining after being treated so well.

We had excellent service from all of the staff at 1760. It was the perfect spot for night out catching up with friends while sharing delicious food together. My favorite was the corn ravioli. We will be back again soon!

I swear I am not exaggerating....this is the most memorable and outstanding dining experience I&#39;ve had in SF! I&#39;ve only lived here for a year, but I am a food slut and have eaten at a huge majority of the hot spots in this city!You&#39;ll definitely want to make reservations at this place. The wait can be pretty long. We started off with a bottle of lambrusco which was reasonably priced.Everything is great for sharing. The top of their menu starts with the smaller plates and as you work your way down, they become more of entree portions. My friend and I started with the SRF Beef Tartare, Della Frattoria Bread, and White Truffle dishes. The Beef Tartare was the best I&#39;ve ever had, amazing flavor and great portion for 2 to share. The Della Frattoria Bread is perfect if you like eating things like patte. Has a similar texture but the onions they add to the dish give it a nice crunch and savory flavor.But OMG the dish that completely won me over was their White Truffle. We had second thoughts about ordering an appetizer sized dish that was $50 but it was so worth it! This was hands down, one of the best things I&#39;ve ever ate. It has a 63 degree egg which was very creamy, mushrooms, white truffle, all in a parmesan emulsion. I think I died and went to heaven when I ate that dish. I would go back there in a heartbeat and have no problem spending another $50 to have that dish. So.freaking.amazing!!!! I&#39;ve had dreams about it ever since.Lastly, the fried duck sandwich is bomb but very filling. I would suggest splitting it with someone. It&#39;s very hearty and full of flavor. You will not be disappointed with any of the dishes here. This place is incredible! I can&#39;t wait to come back!

Food: still good. Yum good. Lobster cerviche must get.the duck Burger and spring peas were good also. The ravioli so so. Desserts yum. Milk chocolate ganache and strawberries with a chocolate cake and sweet cream.Atmosphere: same same. Noisy, but not more than other spots. Good service as usual. I&#39;ve been here dressed not my best. Dressed well for work. Casual. Don&#39;t matter. They treat you well regardless if you get a bottle of wine or no alcohol at all. If you take time to decide or not. My biggest pet peeve is when you go to a place and get that oh so slight tone of disappointment and condescension for the rest of the meal if you don&#39;t feel like drinking that night. Yup. This place knows how to hire their team. They know the value of long term good customer service. So now I come back to eat and drink.

I&#39;m 85% positive that this restaurant does a Google search for &#34;most hipster/esoteric/snobby food&#34;, puts said food components on some sort of giant Wheel of Fortune contraption, spins it until 2-3 items are randomly selected, and throws the winners onto the menu under the guise of food artistry.I didn&#39;t like a thing I ate. And no, I&#39;m not a hick with an uncultured pallet who stabs at things with chopsticks while lamenting a world in which forks aren&#39;t ubiquitous. I just don&#39;t like foam on my oily brussel sprouts or ganache with hints of ashtray, served to resemble the poop emoji.The staff was nice, albeit slow. We finished an appetizer before we ever got our wine, and ultimately felt like everything took forever to arrive. I&#39;m sure part of that is because we didn&#39;t enjoy the experience, but it&#39;s obvious they aren&#39;t a well oiled machine.

Terrific brunch service - got there at 11AM on a Saturday morning and the place was empty. By noon, the place was packed.Kimchi pork belly rice was perfect portion, flavorful and almost juicy. The egg yolk was runny but thick and golden yellow. Incredible.Biscuits were fluffy, warm and buttery. Even the fruit plate felt elevated from the average.Almost every part of the meal was delicious and unique. I will be back again and again.

We loved this restaurant. We try to go to small plate restaurants because you can try so much more food. The atmosphere was great. There is a huge wine list and we tried a domestic Chardonnay that we loved. We had the avocado toast-yum, the tempora-- the lemon foam was awesome, the cavetelli--the reason it&#39;s 4 stars and not 5, the ribs--spicy, meaty, best dish of the night, duck burger--yummy, and the milk chocolate ganache with hickory ice cream-- I&#39;m going to try to make this!

Ahhh-mazzzingg!!Skip the wait and make reservations beforehand! I learned the hard way but it was well worth it. I started off with the pear ginger cocktail and it had a big ice cube of Campari. I was pretty happy with my cocktail!My friend, Cindy, and I wanted to try the uni bucatini but they ran out for the night. However, we were still happy with everything we ordered!The shishito peppers were great! The hazelnuts added a crunch to this dish.The crispy octopus was one of my favorites! Especially paired with the paella.The fried duck sandwich came with a knife through it, part of the presentation, but it&#39;s also nice to have the knife when you plan on sharing the dish.We finished off with the espresso panna cotta! So good! I licked the plate clean. My friend usually isn&#39;t a fan of sweets, but she liked this!My tastebuds are happy, plus we received great service! Excited for the next time I get to dine at this amazing establishment!

SOOOOO GOOOOOD and one of my new favorite restaurants in SF.We came here on a Friday evening and didn&#39;t have to wait, thank goooosh. We ordered the scallops/uni/caviar, fried duck sandwich, grilled pork belly and flatbread. Everything was amazing, service was good and the restaurant/ambiance was nice, perfect date spot! The flatbread we had was alright, nothing to rave about but the caviar was the best- all my favourites in one spoon. The grilled pork belly melts in your mouth and the fried duck sandwich. I just can&#39;t. I really can&#39;t explain, you just have to hit up 1760 and try it yourself. Can&#39;t wait to come back :).

Great food and excellent service!We came in Wednesday night at 8pm with no reservation and didn&#39;t have any trouble getting seated.We ordered the crispy octopus (crispy on the outside, tender on the inside), kabocha ravioli (perfectly al dente), duck sandwich (hearty and flavorful - easily the most filling dish of the night), and the roasted chicken (juicy and oh so deliciously seasoned) for the two of us. Every dish was beautifully plated and had wonderful, complex flavors - though it took some time for the plates to start coming out. We also had the milk chocolate ganache for dessert. It arrived nearly immediately, tasted like the ultimate fancy s&#39;more, and looked like modern art (the good kind).Adding this one to my list of fave SF restaurants! Not cheap - we averaged about $20/plate - but damn tasty.

1760, Verbena, &amp; Stones throw were on my top 3 To-Try list in the Nob Hill neighborhood this past year. I was pleasantly surprised that 1760 probably surpassed my expectations.I came here on two occasions thus far and look forward to returning again. Once during SF Negroni Week which enabled me the opportunity to try all their different cocktails on their special Negroni list. Everything was phenomenal and the prices were absolutely fair ($9-11).On a second occasion I came for date night with my boyfriend and was definitely very impressed with the food and service! The ambiance feels very contemporary and modern, with the exception of the high-top communal table at the front of the restaurant facing Polk street which offer a more family-style affair.The food here is delicious but also innovative. The Uni Bucatini were to-die for in my opinion! It&#39;s one of those special dishes in the city kind of like Seven Hills&#39; or Cotogna&#39;s &#34;Raviolo.&#34; Everything else was solid - we ordered several dishes and shared between the two of us. My other favorites included the lobster, the caviar &amp; uni spoons, and the pork belly. The pork belly was insanely tender and exploding in flavor - I like that it had a charred exterior to it.1760 probably is one of my favorite Nob Hill restaurants at the moment. It doesn&#39;t disappoint and is perfect for any occasion! The only downside is that they do not take large parties but other than that, it&#39;s a great spot and worthwhile to check out at least once.Prices are competitive with others. Again they have the &#34;small dish&#34; concept ranging from $9-$15, and larger/entree-like dishes that are $18-$29.

1. Took us over 15 minutes to get our drinks menu, then another 15 minutes to get our drinks ordered, then another 20 minutes for our drinks to be served. We elected to have dinner at the bar so we could see they were not too busy.2. Each of our main courses delivered at least 20 minutes apart. I had finished my meal before my partners meal arrived.3. I ordered the Pork Sisig which wasn&#39;t to my taste - it was too dry and lacking in seasoning. My partner ordered the Duck Sandwich which came with grounded meat and did not taste like duck.4. Asked for the check twice before receiving it. They had added an extra $82 to the bill by mistake.

This place is a real winner! The cocktails are delicious and clearly crafted by expert bartenders. I&#39;m a big fan of small plates eating for the variety you get and these do not disappoint. I&#39;ve been here a few times and each time the quality is always on point. One my favorites is the octopus which is nice and tender. All the whiskey cocktails are delicious as well :-)

Ordered up a feast with some friends. Here&#39;s what I thought:YES:The pear-ginger cocktail: reminded me of tang, of course I&#39;m sure it wasn&#39;t. But any cocktail that doesn&#39;t taste like alcohol is alright with me.the brussels sprouts: tangy, crispy and a different spin on the fall dishthe crab fat congee: rice porridge with an intense orange hue - yummy and rounded flavorthe grilled shishito peppers: just yum. I can&#39;t even describe the flavors here but it reminded me of korean banchan - this would&#39;ve been fine with white rice.What I could skip:The hamachi crudo: meh - just a boring dish. It had acidity and sweetness that was a little overwhelming.The corn-coconut ravioli: Delicious! But if you&#39;re limited on space, maybe skip this. I think I like filled ravioli&#39;s too much which is why I didn&#39;t love it.

I went to 1760 last week for my second time and was disappointed in myself for not remembering what I ordered my previous visit. After the meal, I remembered why I didn&#39;t remember. 1760 was a huge letdown and I probably had erased it from my memory a la &#34;Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.&#34;I had forgotten at how small and expensive each dish was. The Shishito peppers &amp; brussels sprouts were nothing to write home about, which actually worked out since I wouldn&#39;t even have enough change for a postage stamp after ordering two tiny dishes at $9 each. The coconut ravioli was a bit undercooked and the taste left much to be desired. And lastly, the calmarata pasta had very little octopus actually in it, and when I did manage to find a piece (I felt like Nicholas Cage in National Treasure), it was rubbery and tasteless.On the bright side, the fried duck sandwich was 1760&#39;s only savior. But like a duck, 1760 may seem calm on the surface, but furiously paddling underneath to deliver a positive food experience.

This place is a nice surprise. Great corner location, open kitchen, wide selection of libations. The extra bonus: the staff. The staff are super friendly and attentive. I had the pleasure meeting Uuzi (bartender with glasses and amazing dark hair) for my first visit. The atmosphere is very laid back and this place can easily be anyone&#39;s local go to if they lived in the neighborhood. I had the Har Gow Cavatelli, a nice light shrimp pasta dish. The pasta is hand made in house, the portion was perfect and seemed light but I was completely full/satisfied after my last bite. My first cocktail was uniquely made. That to me speaks volumes when it comes to a great bartender. Customer comes first and to meet their needs. Remix on a bourbon cocktail but was tailored specifically for what I wanted. The next cocktails were the blueberry sage, that drink was tasty but damn it creeps up pretty quick. Thank you 1760 for a nice Sunday night cap! I can&#39;t wait to come back and try the pork belly!

Between 3 to 4 stars. 4 stars if I had not had the duck sandwich.The lobster ceviche was very good. The lobster was very tender and &#34;cooked&#34; perfectly. The coconut cream went very well with the whole dish.The octopus with gigante beans was also very good. The lobster had the perfect amount of chew and tenderness. The beans were well seasoned and the sauce was very good. Can&#39;t recall what kind of sauce.The corn ravioli was good. Not great but still very nice. The corn filling was very creamy but the skin was a little too thick. The broth it was served it was very light but good.The fried duck sandwich could have been good but it was way too salty. Hubby did not want to finish his half. I took out the duck and ate little bites of it with the bun. Also, SF has such good bread but the bun is a travesty. It had this weird sponge-y-ness to it. Disappointed with this dish.

Impeccable service.Food that is as delicious as it looks (and each dish is beautifully presented).Excellent ambiance.I can&#39;t say enough about our recent experience at 1760. Everything was perfect, but what really stood out was the service. I served in restaurants for years, and had my fair share of fine dining experiences, and this staff blew me away. And, all while wearing jeans. I love the relaxed attitude and culture of this restaurant, paired with the top-notch quality of the food and service. Great juxtaposition.I&#39;ll definitely be back soon.

Pretty plating but not actually that tasty. Everything was underwhelming and just slightly missing something. It&#39;s not terrible but it&#39;s not great. It&#39;s more style over substance. The hamachi was fresh. So I can say something positive for 1 out of 5 dishes. The often reviewed duck sandwich is just alright.

I hate to do it but this place deserves a 3 or 3.5 in my opinion due to being way overpriced for the portion size and quality. I still enjoy the scene, but it&#39;s just way overpriced for what it is. I was there last week and was probably most shocked by the $9/spoon caviar item in the menu. I love caviar, and it looked like a decent amount when it arrived, but the other fish/flavors on the spoon completely overpowered the caviar so we couldn&#39;t taste it at all. I felt like I bought an expensive bite of salty fish....which could be fine...but I paid to taste the caviar.I still love the bar, and like the inventive menu quite a bit. It&#39;s just not worth the spend at the end of the day (the food that is, the bar is worth it). The place is always packed though (and even the bar seating is reserved) so really no business reason to lower any prices...until everyone figures out what me and a lot of other yelpers have. I&#39;ll be back again, but probably not for full meals. Maybe an app and a drink before heading somewhere I feel less &#34;taken&#34; for after paying the bill.

Cocktails were interesting (way better than most, to be fair, but I wouldn&#39;t order either again).Wine list is awesome. Particularly neat to have a lot of half bottle options.Food was a mixed bag. Bread was super stale (or maybe heated up and left sitting out?), which was a bummer. Peas were awesome. Other dishes I thought fell flat for a variety of reasons; mostly just thought the flavors were off (some too spicy, some too bland). In general, I see how this place could be awesome. But at least this night, there were more misses than hits.

Trendy, fun, and with an impressive decor, 1760 is definitely a great new restaurant making Frisco yet more of a wonderland for foodies.The food here is, for me, four stars, but the ambiance, the relaxed tone, the waitstaff&#39;s professionalism, the drinks, the creative ingredients, and the amazing dessert all make me feel this place should get the full 5.While the menu itself did not blow me away (it is supposed to go from lightest to heaviest but even our waiter admitted this was a slightly misleading suggestion) the food was certainly quite good.The burratta is a Must Try. It is just insane and perfectly plated. The lollipop kale is similarly awesome. The Crispy Octopus and Cavatelli are also well worth your time. Our waiter was very chill and answered all our questions without a hint of impatience.I must say the dessert here was the best part. Check it out in the pic below. It was a Milk Chocolate Ganache with hickory ice cream. bourbon caramel and little dollops of marshmallow. It was a play on S&#39;mores and it was utterly awesome.Anyway, do not go here expecting food like you are at Benu or Saison, but if you are with a date or some friends and just want to have a straight up awesome time in a really excellent and beautiful dining room then definitely head here. It is fun and very chic without feeling pretentious.Oh yeah, and make sure to get that milk chocolate ganache dessert. So sick.

One of my favorites right now!The food is great and the staff is very attentive.They suggest sharing the dishes family style. I&#39;m assuming because the every dish is quite rich, but it&#39;s a great way to try everything (and no one gets jealous of your dish)!I daydream about the Uni Bucatini sometimes and the Corn Ravioli is cooked perfectly. I hate overcooked pasta, and the ravioli in this dish is chewy enough that the warm corn soup in the middle bursts in your mouth when you bite into it. Yum. The Duck Sandwich is also good to split into bites.They have a tall communal table in the front, next to huge windows facing Polk which is fun to sit at.

Went for Sunday brunch with a group of six. We made our reservation two days prior via Opentable. It was a nice setting with a rustic/laid back ambience. We particularly enjoyed the drinks menu, featuring an eclectic selection of cocktails. However, the food menu was quite limited in options. We ordered a variety of items such as chicken waffles, beignets, fingerling potatoes, French toast, shrimp polenta - all of which were perfectly prepared. The menu changes frequently, so I would like to go back again and try out some of their new additions!

It probably wasn&#39;t the best idea to visit 1760 with a few starving bodybuilding guys but I feel like I still expected a better quality and consistency for the price and portions. Every other dish was either very good or rather mediocre.We came on a Friday night and ordered Fried Duck Sandwich, Hangar Steak, Shishito Peppers, Crispy Octopus, Grilled Pork Ribs, and Haricots Verts.Good: My favorite was the French green beans (Haricots Verts) because they were so juicy, tender and had a great crunch to it. My inner vegetarian could probably eat that all day.The not-so-good: Hangar Steak was overcooked. We asked for medium-rare and it was more like medium-well to well. It was kinda tough to eat certain parts of it. The mushrooms on the side were good though. Crispy Octopus wasn&#39;t that crispy. The inside was a bit too soft for my liking, but that might just be a personal preference.No comment: People seem to love the Duck Sandwich. I didn&#39;t necessarily love it but I didn&#39;t hate it. I just felt kinda meh about the sandwich overall. The slaw that came with the sandwich was excellent though. Good flavor and kick to it.I didn&#39;t try any cocktails but my friends did. It seemed like they enjoyed it.Service is good, the waiters kept refilling our water.

1760 is my favorite restaurant in all of San Francisco, and by far my favorite cocktail bar. I&#39;ve been to Acquerello&#39;s hipper little sister probably 10 times since it opened in 2013. The drinks are herbaceous, expertly mixed and truly creative. The small-plated food is delightful, and while some dishes stay on the menu a long time, their preparation varies dramatically. One month crispy octopus will be paired with roasted peanuts, avocado and little potatoes, the next a jambalaya-like chorizo dressing.Dishes are listed from lightest to heaviest, starting with the crudos and ceviches, which are expertly seasoned, effervescent little bites. Then come dishes like lollipop kale with guanciale and my favorite, the steak tartare spiked with Thai seasonings and Marcona almond puree. Rich plates such as uni bucatini slicked with breadcrumbs and hoisin glazed ribs round out the menu. A clear crowd favorite is the enormous fried duck sandwich - half of this could be my entire dinner.The sweets are impressive but a little too contrived for me. They&#39;ll do like a basil sponge cake with strawberry mousse plated like a Lilliputian garden, or an impressively contorted log of chocolate ganache adorned with marshmallow droplets to evoke fancy s&#39;mores. They always seem more like a display of technical skill than dessert, but it&#39;s a small quibble. In a town with so many forgettable New American sharing menus, 1760&#39;s taste memories keep me coming back.

Just opened for brunch 1-2 months ago. Delicious. Well executed brunch. The menu has more drinks than food. See photos.We ordered:Drink--Green strawberry Bloody Mary - good without the overpowering tomato flavorFood--Duck sandwich - FAN-FRIGGIN-TASTIC - you must get this dishSpring peas - not often that you see a pea entree so we got this; appetizer size; beautiful presentation, see photoBiscuits - really good citrus marmaladeI have to note that their homemade pickles are cut exquisitely thin. Very hard to do and shows their attention to detail.If you&#39;re hungry coming here, you probably won&#39;t leave full but you will leave happy and impressed.Worth dropping by before they get mobbed as it&#39;s a beautiful place with a good brunch setup.

Came here for our anniversary dinner. On a Friday night it was not too packed but we also had reservations.The cocktails were really good and pretty strong. I liked the 1760.For food- my most favorite was the grilled octopus. WOW I was blown away by how delicious and perfectly cooked it was. I am not a natural fan of octopus but after that dish, I can eat octopus every day if it&#39;s cooked like that haha Crispy on the outside and melt in your mouth tender on the inside. Perfection.Second favorite were the bbq ribs, very very good.We also had the flatbread (good) and lobster ceviche (this was good but tiny, I would skip it). Dessert was plantain with ice cream I think?The food are small sizes but very satisfying. It&#39;s not on the cheap side either. Overall though, I recommend 1760.

Mr. NSS: &#34;If I was single, I would never date a &#39;foodie&#39; again.&#34;Me: &#34;Excuse me? WTF is that suppose to mean?&#34;Mr. NSS: &#34;I feel like Al Bundy....always broke.&#34;Me: &#34;The only &#39;Al Bundy&#39; thing about you is, you watching TV with your hands in your pants doing gawd knows what down there!&#34;Mr. NSS: &#34;This conversation better not become part of your Yelp reviews.&#34;Oppsie. Too late...One of the most highly anticipated fall restaurant openings, Mr. NSS and I visited 1760 for the grand opening tonight.After celebrating my birthday two years ago at Acquerello, I knew 1760 would be very promising. They&#39;ve consecutively held a Michelin star since 2007 after all.Promising was an understatement as 1760 was one of the best grand openings I&#39;ve been to this year. Awesome food. Stiff cocktails. Stellar service. It&#39;s a triple threat.While Acquerello is very formal, 1760 is its casual sister restaurant serving Nouvelle American cuisine with Japanese, Italian, and Spanish influences.Everything on the menu is meant to be shared and it&#39;s recommend that you order 2-3 plates per a person. Currently, there&#39;s only 13 items on the menu and 3 desserts:bit.ly/1dXhV2V. Expect to spend about $60 a person (pre-tip) including one cocktail.We left full with no room for dessert unlike another recent opening we attended last week (La Urbana) where we had to make a pit stop to McD afterwards because we were still hungry.~ * ~F O O D~ * ~*Lobster Ceviche w/ Carmelized Coconut, Pineapple &amp; Coriander ($16) - 5 STARSbit.ly/1dXfgq3I&#39;m usually not a fan of ceviche because I find it too acidic but the use of coconut and pineapple were genius as it added an exotic creaminess and touch of tangy sweetness to the fresh lobster chunks.*Sliced Hamachi w/ Pluots, Yuzu Kosho &amp; Puffed Rice ($16) - 4 STARSbit.ly/1dXfNItAs a sashimi feen, the buttery cuts of hamachi along with the plum and citrus-chili concoction was a nice twist to a Japanese classic.*Uni Bucatini w/ Garlic, Red Pepper &amp; Bread Crumbs ($19) - 4 STARSbit.ly/17SXFZXAs a huge uni fan, this Japanese-Italian fusion dish was done right; perfectly al-dente pasta gently caressed by a light cream sauce and topped with uni and deliciously crunchy bread crumbs for a texture contrast.*Grilled Pork Belly w/ Gigante Bean, Radicchio Slaw &amp; Carrots ($20) - 5 STARSbit.ly/1dXghybLike pork butter, the pork belly was nicely crisp on the outside and uber tender on the inside. Loved the radicchio slaw which helped cut through the richness of the pork belly.*Hanger Steak w/ Carmelized Onion, Grapes &amp; Arugula ($22) - 4 STARSbit.ly/1dXfjSwSous-vide before grilling, the steak was wonderfully tender and flavorful to boot. I only wished there was more of a char to give that smoky nuance.~ * ~S E R V I C E~ * ~For grand opening day, the staff was very polished, not to mention very knowledgable (about the menu) and attentive. Food service was very timely as well.One of the owners came by to thank us for coming which is always a nice touch.~ * ~A M B I A N C E / D E C O R~ * ~Reminiscent of a typical Mission hot spot, 1760 was very minimalistic with a grey and brown color scheme, a communal table, leather booths, and open kitchen in the back. There&#39;s a long, narrow bar partitioned off from the main dining area. Make sure to order one of their stiff cocktails (the Yuzu-Shiso was my fav:bit.ly/17mCz7l).~ * ~P A R K I N G~ * ~Fairly easy street parking before 6 pm.When I returned from the restroom, I found Mr. NSS bopping his head from side-to-side.Mr. NSS: &#34;This is my jam...yea...this is my jam...they&#39;re playing Outkast!&#34;*Small fist pump*Me: &#34;Shhhh...we&#39;re not in a club.&#34;Mr. NSS: &#34;4.5 STARS.&#34;Me: &#34;Huh?&#34;Mr. NSS: &#34;Not only are they playing my jam, the food is really good here. Both the steak and pork belly had good depth of flavor.&#34;WTF happened to my food noob bf?

I want to give them more stars, but at the end of the day, this meal was not worth 200 dollars.We had a variety of items. The lobster ceviche, the octopus, the ravioli, the hanger steak, the fingerling potatoes, the fried duck sandwich, and some wine.FIRST, the duck sandwich was hellaaa good. If I could impart one piece of advice, it was be to get a duck sandwich per person. That is all. This should not be shared.Second, why so many potatoes in the fingerling potatoes, when everything else that is served has the portion size appropriate for a small child.To sum my experience with the food, basically everything was mediocre, maybe a little better, with the exception of the duck sandwich. So the next time I&#39;m here with my girlfriend, we are probably just going to get 2 duck sandwiches, or 3, or 4.. er maybe.Service was attentive. But then when they packed up our enormous portion of potatoes togo, we never received them on our way out. Oops? No huge loss I guess, as it wasn&#39;t that great.Long story short: just get that duck though.

Returned after a long gap, alas we were overall disappointed both the service and the food. Spending a lot on small plates means you expect each to be tasty and fulfilling. This was not the case, hence I would say this spot is average at best. We left regretting the money we wasted on subpar food. While we dined at the common table, we felt the service was poor, with the waitress bumping us by mistake or taking the kitchen forever to bring over the dishes.No bueno

The cocktails here are out of this world, and our bartender was awesome.But oh my god. The portions here are fit for a bird. We, a party of two, ordered 7 dishes (yes, 7) and left unsatisfied.Skip the flatbread (really small and not tasty), the little gem lettuces, the lobster ceviche, and the milk chocolate ganache dessert. They are all so teeny tiny.The shishito peppers, the beef tartare, and the pain de mie are okay.Flavors are great, but nothing makes me more annoyed than leaving hungry from a stingy restaurant.Oh and my friend had his backpack stolen here a year ago from the storage area, so don&#39;t leave anything unattended.

One of the best dining experiences ever! 1760 was a must try for me during my recent visit to San Francisco, based on other yelp reviews and their menu. I am so thankful that I went here. We treated our friends to an amazing dinner here as a thank you for letting us stay at their place for the week. All of us were blown away by the amazing flavorful food and couldn&#39;t stop commenting on it for the next two days.The Haricots Verts (green beans) with yuba, lime, and sesame was unlike anything I have tried before. This dish wasn&#39;t even on my radar and I am so thankful the waiter had suggested it. The flavors were ridiculous and it was my absolute favorite!We almost didn&#39;t order the Fried Duck Sandwich with slaw, pickles, and spicy aioli, because my girlfriend is turned off by anything duck. I had to try it based on its popularity. Ironically it ended up being my girlfriend&#39;s favorite dish of the night and was simply amazing!The Lobster Ceviche was also a big winner. We wish we had ordered two of these because there wasn&#39;t much and we were all fighting over it.We also enjoyed the Pork Belly, Shishito Peppers, and Grilled Octopus. Although I enjoyed the grilled octopus I have had plenty better. I only say this because this is the dish that first attracted me to 1760, so I was surprised that I was more impressed by most of the other dishes we had.1760 will definitely be a must visit anytime I visit San Francisco in the future. Or it would be nice if Chicago could steal their chef away.

This place lost 1 star for service (we waited 15 minutes for our drinks and ~25 minutes for our food which came out lukewarm)... even the couple sitting next to us was complaining. And 1 star was lost for the portion size. The food was good... but not good enough the validate such small portions.Lobster ceviche was yummy... the coconut aioli was amazing.Pork Sisig was also delicious... but not exceptional. For those prices and portion sizes you would expect something more.

I don&#39;t know if its because we order the wrong dishes, but I felt that none of the plates were &#34;mind-blowing&#34; amazing. Everything was mediocre; but I didn&#39;t spend some much money on just mediocre plates. The most tasty thing that we got was the green beans; the sauce was tangy and had a nice kick to the dish. The dessert was good, but not for that price.Overall, you&#39;ll get good service, good company (I guess that&#39;s if you bring enjoyable people), drinks were decent, and food a-ok.P.S. there a $4 cake cutting fee per person if you bring your own cake.

Service : 5 stars for staff that doesn&#39;t check on you every 2 seconds but were always there when you need themFood: We shared 5 plates between the 2 of us. We are both big eaters so I would probably recommend about 4 dishes for an average appetite. Here&#39;s the breakdown:Hamachi crudo - At first I thought this was averagely good but then I took a second bite with those little yellow flowers and *blam* the dish made senseBurrata - Beautiful. Tasted like high class pizza.Crispy octopus - Great texture and served on a bed of rice with a kick of spice. Delicious!Fried duck sandwich - I don&#39;t like duck but I tried this anyway and I was glad I did. Sooooo delicious!! Especially the slaw that comes with it.BBQ pork belly - I kid you not there was a guy sitting on the table next to me that turned around 4 times to look at our plate. He then proceeded to ask the server what it was. This was my favourite dish. The pork belly was not super fatty and melted in my mouth. The peaches complimented the flavours.Espresso panna cotta - Genius combination of flavor and texture. We had a small battle between spoons to get the last bit of it.PS I asked for a non-alcoholic beverage. They have a house special that is not on the menu. It was cucumber, ginger and seltzer. It was perfect. Not too gingery.I will sleep well tonight thanks to 1760.

Came here for a second time and was again blown away by the octopus. The Brussel sprouts were not the best I&#39;ve ever had but the ribs were amazing and will definitely come back for these. To drink, the celery chartreuse drink was my favorite.Starting to like this place more and more.

Heading to 1760 for our first meal in town was a little scary. We were excited to be out and about, but also starving and exhausted from flying all day, so the 9pm reservation couldn&#39;t come soon enough. When we started looking at photos of the food on Yelp, we got nervous about how hungry we would still be after the meal here. We were also a little worried that we were out of our element going to what seemed like it would be an uncomfortably upscale restaurant. Luckily, the wait was worth it and the food was not only delicious, but sufficient. Also, while being just fancy enough, this place was pretty relaxed.There were four of us and the waitress explained that the idea was to share the plates. That&#39;s always a wonderful idea to me, because I have so much trouble deciding all the time. We started with the lobster ceviche, which was fantastic! There was only a little bit, but the proportions were perfect for all of us to get a taste and still be hungry and even more excited for the rest of our meal. I had my sights set on the corn ravioli, but they were all out of that as well as the, crispy octopus, burrata, and bucatini. We settled on the grilled pork ribs, cavatelli, fried duck sandwich, and the hangar steak.The cavatelli came first and I was enamored with the lobster mushrooms. I need to get my hands on some of those. The pasta itself was OK, but nothing too crazy for us. Then came the duck and ribs. I don&#39;t eat either of these meats generally, but I can say that they were prepared perfectly. This didn&#39;t change the fact that I am not a duck or pork fan, but I can say that I wasn&#39;t upset for having eaten my 1/4 of the dishes. Then, surprisingly, the octopus came out! Apparently, they had some extra floating around and I&#39;m SO INCREDIBLY THANKFUL for that because that octopus was a dream. It&#39;s been a week since I ate it and I can&#39;t stop thinking about it. The hangar steak was also perfectly prepared and flavorful, but nothing will overshadow the octopus and lobster mushrooms. We had the milk chocolate ganache for dessert and were equally impressed with the presentation as well as the taste. Overall a perfect meal.I had the sugar snap pea cocktail, and wow, was it a strange experience! I loved it!The service was fantastic. Our server was enthusiastic and everyone that came by our table was incredibly nice without being annoying or pushy. Shout out to the guy that was clearing some dishes and broke one of the super fragile beer glasses on our table. He dealt with the break so smoothly and, even though it wasn&#39;t upsetting or an inconvenience to us, we appreciated how apologetic he clearly was.

I&#39;ve been wanting to try 1760 for awhile-- i&#39;ve heard only great things and wanted to see what the fuss was about. Luckily, we got in on a Thursday without too much trouble. It&#39;s a small plate thing, so for two people, doing about 3-4 dishes should do it if you aren&#39;t super hungry. We did the fried flowers, octopus, raviolis and drinks to start with. Everything was great and the service was super friendly. It definitely filled up fast, pretty much as soon as we arrived, so would highly recommend reservations (that&#39;s how we got in) and to try out weekdays if the weekends aren&#39;t working for ya :)

When my bf and I heard that Aquerello was opening up a casual little sister restaurant down the block, we knew we had to eat here. Dining at Acquerello for Valentines&#39; Day and our 3-year anniversary, both times were winners, so we were both very eager to try 1760.Getting reservations was easy when the 1760 first opened, but as time went on, their popularity grew. We tried adjusting our reservation to add more people, which was an impossible task -so we settled on a table for two on a Friday night at 6:15pm. FYI as of last week, they told me they&#39;re booked solid for tables 3+ until end of October! O_O But, I just checked on open table and they still have 5pm, 5:30pm reservations open.The menu is fantastic, described as &#34;contemporary American&#34; but I think it also contains seafood influences. We wanted to get a whole bunch of things since practically everything on the menu seemed to jump out at us!Food in order from most favorite to decent:1) Corn Ravioli. Not sure if you have been to Cotogna when they&#39;ve done a corn triangoli pasta, but we had it once before, and these flavors tasted like almost a replica (in a good way)! The ravioli had a circular shape, filled with sweet corn sauce on the inside - it was melt in your mouth heaven. Think of the juice that&#39;s inside a Xiao Long Bao!2) Uni Bucatini. How wonderful! Uni from Santa Barbara, with pasta, one of the best combinations ever. 1760 definitely executed this dish well.3) Pork Belly. We unexpectedly ordered this one at the end since my bf was still hungry. We were blown away by how different the dish was from what we expected it to be. It did not resemble bacon at all, no distinct levels of fat. Instead, it was just a nice slab of fatty meat - yahoo! Definitely surprise of the night.4) Lobster Ceviche. Fresh lobster, fresh vegetables, sweet taste of everything combined. It was a very simple dish, but showcased how simplicity can also be sublime. It was the freshness of each ingredient that made this dish stand out.5) Duck sandwich. Although delicious, and very beautifully presented, it was a bit too heavy for my taste. My boyfriend really loved this dish though!We also got the Milk Chocolate Ganache for dessert, which was beautiful and delicious too. With ganache the shape of a soft curly candy bar, and marshmallows that were slightly torched, it was delicious. The presentation was similar to what Dominique Crenn would do, aka, &#34;A walk through the forest.&#34;We already made a second reservation for November...can&#39;t wait!

Love this spot - super tasty small plates menu. Can easily rack up a pricey bill but that seems to be the case at most places in SF.

Yum. Seriously. I did not know what I was getting myself into and the food coma that would ensue. But it was fully worth it. We ate brunch, and everything was amazingly flavorful and tasty. I decided to try a little bit of most of the items on the menu and I was in love, with food. And the servers, they were all so nice! My favorite was the Kimchi Fried Rice, ohhh and the Fingerling Potatoes were soooo good too. I would highly recommend this spot. Word.

Good food. Poor value. Fun atmosphere.Went here on a Friday night a while back. Fun buzz to the room and very good service. Young crowd on Polk.Pleased with the food overall, everything was good, just missing out on being great.Portion sizes are tiny, and prices are not.Cocktail - the 1760 was, frankly, one of the worst I&#39;ve ever had. And it&#39;s on the 7x7 Big Drink List. Someone must have had quite a few drinks before trying this one, methinks.Probably won&#39;t be back anytime soon. Maybe if you sit at the bar, order drinks and a few key food items, you&#39;d leave feeling a little better about the experience.Food: 4Value: 2Service: 4Ambiance: 3.5Overall: 3.5 (rounded down to 3 for Yelp&#39;s purposes)

1760 is amazing! I&#39;ve been here several times - delicious food, a great value for the price. It&#39;s our go-to place when we have to show off how delicious SF food can be.The food works tapas style - so you order a bunch of different plates for the table and share. This means you get to try a variety of delicious foods to learn how consistently yummy everything at 1760 is.Some of the dishes that are a MUST:- caviar - caviar has a snooty blegh stereotype that is not at all represented here! Yes it has fish eggs, but it also comes with uni and other delicious flavors that inspire me to order this every time I come to 1760.- corn ravioli - so sweet, so yum! You see ravioli with your eyes but in your mouth it&#39;s a sweet explosion of tastiness.- burrata - so it&#39;s just bread with stuff on top, but the stuff on top makes this amazing! Again, 1760 is great at taking a bunch of flavors, mixing them, and making you wish you could eat at 1760 every night.- octopus - I was wary of this one, since octopus doesn&#39;t always excite me, but I should have trusted 1760&#39;s skill, &#39;cuz this was amazing! It was octopus and paella - the paella was tasty and the octopus was cooked so it wasn&#39;t too chewy, and together they were beautiful.- chocolate dessert - don&#39;t remember the name, but the description might say something about s&#39;mores. This is fantastic! Take marshmallows and caramel and graham cracker crumbs and giant tootsie-like twists of chocolate, and eat them all together and it&#39;s amazing!I could probably rave more about other amazing dishes at 1760, since they&#39;re all good, but I should also mention that the service is amazing and friendly. We were a complicated bunch, with a nut allergy and a vegan, and they did a great job of making us aware of our options and expanding them by changing the dishes a bit.Love 1760, can&#39;t wait to go back!

Very impressed with this place. We&#39;ve been here a couple of times and tried quite a number of items on the menu. Most of the items are executed really well, with unique and unexpected flavor pairings. We love the lobster ceviche, corn ravioli, burrata, BBQ pork belly, crispy octopus, and the strawberry Bavarian for dessert. Other dishes are pretty solid. The only disappointment was the duck sandwich - too much stuff going on and the flavor was too busy to drown the flavor of the duck.The platings here are whimsical and fun. We like the vibe of the place too. Good music, laid back but intimate setting, friendly service. Many interesting cocktails and a great selection of wine. We are definitely coming back before it becomes impossible to get a reservation here.

I love 1760 and will be back again. There were 4 of us in the group and we had 8 dishes. They were ALL amazing. Beef tartare, kale, uni pasta, crab pasta, fried duck burger (xs), porkbelly (amazingggg ingredients), milk chocolate ganache, etc. I love every dish and this very very rarely happens. I will definitely be back. I recommend going with 4 people just so you can try everything as the portions are small. The drinks were beautiful as I got the ginger and pear drink with vodka and not gin.

Very very good food! Make sure you make a reservation. We ended up sitting at the &#34;community table&#34; which was fine but it would have been nice to get our own table if we planned ahead a little bit better. Everything on the menu is crafted with care, I love how the menu is layed out too from lightest to heartiest, smallest to biggest. The brussels sprouts were some of the best I&#39;ve ever tasted (and I barely like them in the first place). The place is a little bit pricy, but if you&#39;re in the mood to splurge on some great food you should definitely check it out!

I love the addition of a higher-end restaurant to the neighborhood. I do feel like the prices are a tad on the expensive-for-what-you-get side and that if they&#39;re truly meant to be small plates that you order several of, either the portions need to be a little bit bigger or the prices need to be a little bit cheaper.But as far as the actual food, it was delicious. The cocktails were also good. The service was above average for San Francisco, but they could have refilled my water more frequently.

You absolutely MUST get the Lobster Ceviche! The curry and coconut give a perfectly balanced sweetness, and the lobster itself is quite good.I also recommend the Pork Sisig. Good quality, crunchy pieces of pork (not overly fatty or salty). And I&#39;m impressed to find a Filipino-inspired dish well done!Unfortunately I was underwhelmed by the wine, so I had to subtract a star. Next time I&#39;ll try a cocktail. But overall good experience and trendy ambiance.

Yum! Great service and delicious food. We tried the Della Fattoria Bread, Bucatini, and Grilled Pork Ribs. I was highly skeptical when the waitress said that their dishes were good for sharing, but she was right! We left SO full.We started with the bread which was toasted and very tasty paired with the toppings - I found the toppings to be a little bit oily but I still really liked it. The Bucatini was amazing! Creamy and heavy but incredibly flavorful - I&#39;m so happy I tried this dish! We finished with the ribs which were average; the meat was cooked well but I didn&#39;t enjoy the taste as much as our previous dishes. I&#39;d love to come back and try the lobster ceviche (with of course the Bucatini again!)

Hamachi crudo was the absolute bestest dish! Seriously! We ordered 5 dishes for 2 people: octopus, fingerling potatoes, hanger steak, hamachi were all cooked to perfection, incredible fusion of flavors.Def 4-5 dishes is good for 2 people as they are tasting plate sizes.Highly recommend the 1760 cocktail too. Cocktails sit around $12-$14.Definitely coming back. Reservation is recommended.

*Dear reader, you are forewarned that the below content is going to be a bit wordy and kind of excessive... Sorry in advance*Hello 1760, you may just be my new best friend....//&amp; the discovery of 1760//A month prior, I took a visit to get my steak fix at HOPR on Van Ness and parked right across from 1760. I didn&#39;t recall the name of it but recalled it being a black building and was packed so *took note in my mind to research later*.//&amp; the reservation//It was my friend&#39;s birthday and a few days before, I was stressing over making reservations at a restaurant in the city for a weekend so last minute. Thankfully, I kept on refreshing and refreshing on open table and a 7:30pm conveniently opened up. SCORE! In the little note area, I mentioned that we were coming for a birthday celebration and if it was possible for them to write happy birthday on my friend&#39;s dessert if we were to order one so that I could surprise said friend. When I called 2 days before to confirm, they told me they couldn&#39;t write messages because it wouldn&#39;t go with the dessert but they would accommodate her birthday (so it was nice that they actually read the requests area).//&amp; the menu//Everything on the menu is meant to be shared among 2-3 people. Communal-style.Dish sizes range from smallest at the top to larger portions at the bottom.//&amp; the food//*COMPLIMENTARY RYE CHIP WITH YOGURT &amp; JAM (apricot?) - it produced an interesting flavor. The fusion of yogurt and a tart jam added a surprisingly nice touch.*MACHERRONI - I was devastated that uni bucatini wasn&#39;t on the menu but I was so glad I got this instead! The lemon juice infused into the pesto created a lighter pasta that was very refreshing. Bits of mint here and there with the pasta and pine nuts created a hearty meal. They weren&#39;t cheap on the shredded dungeness crab either! YUM.*BBQ PORK BELLY - countless and countless of times, I&#39;ve been to restaurants that have not cooked pork belly to my liking at all. 1760&#39;s was solid. It had a bit of smoked flavor to it, was juicy and succulent, and had a spicy-kick to it after every bite. It sounded a bit odd that the pork belly laid on top of a bed of corn porridge but OMG I think I was in pork belly heaven when I combined the 2 items together. The peach bits were just there (I could do without them in this entree but I didn&#39;t dislike them).*BDAY ICE CREAM, compliments of the chef - remember how I said I made a request on open table and the waitress who answered my call said she couldn&#39;t write a message but said she&#39;ll try to do what she can to make it acknowledged? Well, she brought over this dessert which was an amazing and refreshing palate cleanser. I&#39;m not sure what kind of ice cream it was but it was light and fluffy and the combo with the raspberry granita underneath it was great! Great way to end the meal.//&amp; the service//They were very attentive and nice. Our water bottle was changed constantly and our waters poured. Our dishes and utensils were changed after every dish we ate. I don&#39;t find that happening as often at other restaurants!I had a blast and so did my friend. Impeccable service. Great food. Great location. Great atmosphere.Only downside I&#39;d say is that 4% surcharge for the sf healthy workers program that they have all across sf but other than that, 1760, you&#39;ve secured yourself a place in my heart! I will be back **said in Arnold Schwarzenegger voice**

Nice place, easy to reach, parking can be problem like all over in SF. Seating looks like it is not good for groups but I am sure they can arrange it, too. Staff was helpful and nice. Food is to share, but if you&#39;re looking to get full, here is not for you! If you dont like raw meat, dont order the beef! I think, duck burger was quite delicious, presentation was interesting too. Duck meat is however a bit different than I ate before, but I like it this way. Roasted chicken and pesto souce was the best one between our orders. If you want to try different place and wnjoy your night, give here a chance

One of our favorite restaurants in the city. They no longer serve uni pasta but that was by far the most delicious plate I&#39;ve ever tried. Nice staff friendly ambience.

This place is a solid 4.5 STARS.Food was awesome, great expansive space. Although I was not a fan of their spazzy music choices (going from jazz to hip-hop to classical every few minutes).Everything was delicious, and I wanted more....Their grilled octopus was tender, flavorful with just the lightly charred outside to give it that crispy texture, they were best grilled octopus I&#39;ve had in SF!Kale salad was delicious with just the right amount of tanginess...I just wish they gave us more :-( Shishito peppers and uni bucatini were both excellent. They gave us a generous portion of uni...it tasted slightly like a decadent and high-end version of mac-n-cheese.I was not impressed by their desserts, however...it was pretty good but not that memorable.

The place was packed on a Tuesday evening and I totally see why. The food here is solid and the restaurant is comfy. The dishes here are meant to be shared. We ordered:- Lobster ceviche - yum- Kale salad - yum! a bit salty- Asparagus ravioli - not bad, but didn&#39;t really taste like asparagus and the texture was a bit weird- Beef tartare - yum- Octopus - yum- Crab maccheroni - yum- Chocolate ganache - yum- Warm banana bread - yumEverything was great. However, giving it a 4 because nothing particularly stood out as amazing and most things tasted pretty similar to other restaurants that I&#39;ve been to.

Castelvetrano Olives, Shishito Peppers, Crispy Octopus, Fried Duck Sandwich, Honey-Thyme Pain de Mie, and Milk Chocolate Ganache were the food highlights. That dessert includes amazing and crazy hickory smoke ice cream!Cocktails were delicious. Very inventive flavors and super well balanced. Most were not very spirit-forward, but unlike most restaurant cocktails, they weren&#39;t overly sweet. My favorite was quite spirit-forward, though, the Garam Masala-Cardamom - thyme. orange. toasted cardamom. bourbon.Great nice but casual atmosphere and service.

I don&#39;t really have much to say about this place since it didn&#39;t really impress or disappoint me. My whole dining experience is good, but non-impressive. The food here is decent, but nothing spectacular. I have to say though- I do the love their Lobster Ceviche.Service is friendly and nice and the decoration/ambiance is lovely.

When I think of Polk Street, wild partying and 4am donuts comes to mind. That&#39;s why I was pleasantly surprised to find such a delicious restaurant amongst the madness.Not only was the food amazing, but the presentation was very unique. Even the $4 bread came out looking fantastic. The menu is a little confusing, with no separate appetizers and main entrees but instead a lot of small plates that vary in size. The Corn Ravioli is easily one of the best things I&#39;ve ever eaten, an inexplicable combination of cheese and soup (I know it sounds weird, just trust me). The Grilled Pork Ribs and Uni are other personal favorites. Everything is a little overpriced, but I think the quality of the food warrants the price.Because of the sleek decor, I would recommend this as a date spot. Reason I would hesitate though are the tables are placed very close to one another and it is quite loud. Tables were so close in fact that I could literally hear the conversations of all surrounding tables.

Came here for dinner with a party of five on a Thursday evening. It&#39;s a very cool, trendy, tapas-style place. I really enjoyed the atmosphere. Our waitress was also very pleasant and service was good. They had a variety of specialty cocktails on the drink menu along with wines. I went with a glass of wine while some others in my group tried the more diverse cocktails. Everyone seemed to enjoy them.As for the food, I honestly wasn&#39;t a huge fan, mainly because the tapas are very small and the prices are high. I understand that things are more expensive in San Francisco than in my neck of the woods on the east coast, but the prices just seemed way too high for the amount of food you actually got. Every dish was presented beautifully though. You could tell they pay attention to detail when plating the food. We ordered about 9 plates for our group, and literally we only got one, or maybe two bites from each plate, which was kind of disappointing. I&#39;m not a huge fan of mixing that many things in one meal either. The only dish that stood out as awesome to me was the ravioli. I would have liked to just have a plate of that myself. Oh, and also the banana bread desert was pretty fabulous, but again, I wish I got more than one bite of it.Overall, a cool spot if you&#39;re into the tapas style of dining .Great atmosphere, but the food/price ratio missed the mark for me.

Very impressed!One of my good friends and I went to dinner at 1760 last night and absolutely loved everything about it - from the modern and completely-open classy ambiance to the friendly and extremely helpful service to the delicious and avant-garde food. I was smitten and will definitely be back for more.Now let&#39;s dive into the good stuff - the food and cocktails. When I head to a somewhat upscale restaurant, I usually prefer to stick to wine instead of cocktails. However, don&#39;t make that mistake and miss out on these divinely concocted delicious drinks. Each cocktail is made with such effort and specific ingredients to cater to your mood. I asked for something refreshing to remove the stress of a tough day and the waiter recommended a Black Current Bramble - wowza! And for my second drink, I asked for something with a bit more pizzazz yet refreshing Kumquat-Coconut - also wowza! My friend got the 1760 and the Pear-Ginger and loved them as well.As for the food, I highly recommend ordering ~ 3 items per person (1 heavy one and 2 lighter ones). Our favorites were: Brussel Sprouts (this isn&#39;t your everyday brussel sprouts with bacon... the texture alone makes this dish worth trying!), Cavatelli (one of the best pastas I&#39;ve had with tender pork cheek meat!), the Fried Duck Sandwich (tender duck meat with a plethora of spices and delicious spicy aioli), and the Lobster Ceviche (it&#39;s actually not raw unlike most ceviches. It&#39;s slightly cooked and very yummy).My friend had dined here before and also recommended the Octopus and the Hamachi Crudo.So on your next stroll on Polk Street, if you&#39;re looking for a delicious and classy dinner without any pretentiousness, definitely check out 1760!Happy Eating, Yelpers!

Three dishes you definitely MUST MUST try: corn ravioli, bbq pork belly, and the burrata. These three are incredible. The intermezzo dessert (balsamic peach salad with yogurt ice cream) was also perfection.Also good but nothing hugely special: roast chicken and dungeness crab.Skippable: Duck sandwich. (I&#39;m a huge fan of duck, but this was just too rich.)The service was spot on. Our water glasses were always full, clean plates promptly replaced dirty ones, and the staff was friendly and helpful. If all of their dishes tasted as good as those first three, this place would undoubtedly deserve five stars.Great spot for sharing and tasting with friends!

Came here about a month ago to celebrate my birthday. I&#39;ve been keeping this place on the radar since it opened and I finally had the chance to check it out. We had reservations but had to wait about 20 min for the table to be ready. I wasn&#39;t too annoyed by it since it was primetime Saturday night. The hostess checked on us a few times which was sweet of her and very professional.It&#39;s tapas style which I like since you can try a variety of dishes without going overboard. We opted for 5 dishes. The first 3 are on the smaller side and the pasta and sandwich were the main dishes.Hamachi CrudoLobster CevicheCrispy OctopusBucatiniFried Duck SandwichWhat was the best dish? Personally, it has to be the lobster ceviche. It&#39;s the only dish that I wanted more of and I scraped every ounce of that sauce out of that bowl. The coconut with lime sauce was refreshing and light but had a creamy texture that went with the lobster perfectly.The one I could do without? Probably the Hamachi. It didn&#39;t do much, was overpriced and had shaved celery which didn&#39;t add anything other than texture.The bucatini was good. It was a nice change from SPQR&#39;s version. I like both to be honest. SPQR is rich and smokey, however 1760 is surprisingly light and refreshing.Overall, I&#39;d come back again for a dinner party or to check out some of the other dishes. It&#39;s not bad and should be around for a while.

I purchased a Gilt City coupon for this place and I had high hopes. We started off with the biscuits which were absolutely delicious, however our meals were disappointed. I got the Rock Shrimp brunch entree and it was the smallest entree I&#39;ve ever seen. We had to get another order of biscuits because I wasn&#39;t remotely full, I&#39;m just glad I didn&#39;t have to pay 18 bucks for it. We got a bottle of champagne that was supposed to come with a &#34;carafe&#34; of juice, and instead we got approximately a cup of juice in a carafe that wasn&#39;t even a quarter full. We of course ran out of juice, and we when asked for more we were charged $3. I enjoyed this meal simply because I didn&#39;t pay much for it, but I won&#39;t be back.

Last night the bf and I stumbled into this place when the Thai spot across the street closed at 10 pm. For a Saturday at 10, this place was pretty crowded, but they conveniently had 2 open spots at the end of the bar - perfect spot.The service was pretty good, the drinks were UNREAL - I had the blackberry mint with tequila, seriously one of the best cocktails I&#39;ve had in a while.We ordered the Brussels sprouts, octopus pasta and steak. For the prices, the food didn&#39;t totally blow me away - except for the Brussels sprouts which were unreal.Overall I would definitely come back for drinks and some appetizers - I would probably head somewhere else for the main course though.

Wow a great new American restaurant in the Nob Hill area. Came here to catch up with a friend on a Thursday night, and this place was packed. Be sure to make a reservation in advance. But, if you are planning to do walk-in, there looked to be a large communal table at the front of the restaurant, which helps your chances.1760 suggests sharing dishes family style and for my party, they suggested doing around 4 plates. That being said for two people, unless you have extremely large appetites, I think you will be quite satisfied with 3.We started with the lobster ceviche. This dish had a good size helping of lobster, perfect to share between two people. Nice acidic flavoring, but could have used a little more spice. Overall a nice light dish to begin the evening. Following, we had the crispy octopus. This was my favorite dish of the evening. It helps that I love octopus, but the portion-size was perfect. We were given a good amount of octopus in addition to a nice pad of rice underneath. If you are familiar with grilled octopus, this is the flavor and type of dish you should expect when ordering this item. It is not truly a crispy octopus (suggesting fried). Next, we had the uni. This was an interesting dish for me. It is very rich, and was a bit much for my palate. However, the first couple of bites were excellent, but the quantity is so large that after a while it lost its appeal and became overwhelming. We ended the night with the fried duck sandwich. This was supposedly the fan favorite dish, but I must stick to my guns and say that the octopus was the best. The fried duck sandwich was good, and reminded me of a crab cake sandwich. However, if I had one critique, I wish that the duck flavor came through a little more as it was a bit overpowered by the slaw.Overall, the food had great taste, but 4 stars as there are some improvements on flavoring that could be made. The environment is awesome, modern and chic, but you may find it a little loud, so don&#39;t plan on having an intimate quiet night out here. I will definitely add this to my list of places to revisit. I enjoyed the menu composition and saw a lot more dishes I hope to try. 1760 looks like it will be sticking around for a while.

It&#39;s definitely worth making a reservation for 1760 on Open Table.Fans of duck swoon over the duck sandwich, but for vegetarians/pescatarians, I can recommend instead the Lobster Ceviche, Brussels Sprouts (yay, no bacon!). Crab Maccheroni, and the Warm Banana Bread with Chunkey Monkey ice cream. All standout dishes. Service was attentive, and the sommelier was helpful. They sell 375 ml bottles, which are perfect for sharing between two.A tip: like at many establishments, the dishes are listed in order of &#34;lightest&#34; to &#34;heaviest,&#34; however, it can be deceiving. The Brussels Sprouts were actually quite large, and could be considered an entree size even though they are one of the least expensive items on the menu and considered a small plate. It&#39;s worth asking your server to give you a size estimation of dishes, versus blindly following the &#34;2 sides, 1 entree per person&#34; scale.

Made a reservation for 4 ppl on a Sat. night. Only options were for a 7pm reservation or something for 9pm so I think this place is getting pretty popular so be sure to make reservations ahead of time.The menu is mostly small bites/sharing plates and it is listed from lightest to heaviest (starting from light appetizers to more entree/heartier items). All the items on the menu sounded delish so we all got a cocktail and ordered some appetizers to share. Here&#39;s what we ordered and what I thought:To Drink:-Pear-Ginger-The 1760-Mango And SpiceHow were the drinks?-Pear-Ginger: This was my drink and I really liked it. I think they infused the pear with the ice cube so as it melts, it doesn&#39;t water down the drink but more pear flavor is released. Really refreshing!-The 1760: My bf had this *i think?* It was ok. Mezcal always has a band-aid like taste to me. This was ok as it was more of that &#34;smokey&#34; flavor mezcal has and the mint helped lightened this flavor up.-Mango And Spice: My friend had this and it he said it was good. I only had a sip and it tasted sweet and mango-y.To Eat:-Lobster Ceviche caramelized coconut, pineapple, coriander-Brussels Sprouts crispy onion, aromatic herbs-SRF Beef Tartare marcona almond, herbs, chile-Grilled Pork Belly gigante bean, radicchio slaw, carrots-Fried Duck Sandwich slaw, pickles, spicy aioliHow was the Food! 0_0-Lobster Ceviche: really good! Although the portions seem like its more for 2 people? We had 4 ppl fighting for bits of lobster but it had lots of that good creamy coconut flavor.-Brussels Sprouts: I love brussel sprouts by default but these were really good! Something about those aromatic herbs made these taste heartier, I would go back for these sprouts!-SRF Beef Tartare: Very delicate flavors but so yum! Again a little bit hard to share with 4 ppl but we all had one bite and it was delish.-Grilled Pork Belly: Was highly anticipated but I think this was just ok? I didn&#39;t care for the bean mixture the pork belly was sitting on.-Fried Duck Sandwich: HIGHLIGHT of the dinner. We ordered two of these so us couples can share. Honestly I think I could have ate 2 of these myself. the duck was savory and soooo good. I would go back again and again just for this!Overall, nice place to catch up on drinks and sharing plates. It is a little pricey, I think we tried like half the menu but if you stick to the duck sandwich and one appetizer and one cocktail its not that bad price-wise.

Overall, nice addition to the SF scene. Great cocktails and well priced menu.We tried the lobster ceviche, uni bucatini, brussel sprouts, beef tartare, and duck sandwich. The only slight miss was the duck sandwich, partly because it took so long to get after the previous course and the slaw in sandwich was refrigerator cold.The 1760 cocktail was really interesting, never had cumin in a drink before.Great service and I liked the layout of the restaurant.

This may be the most expensive brunch I&#39;ve ever had, but I&#39;d say it was worth eating ramen for the week after. I didn&#39;t realize it was small plates until we sat down, which changed the price calculation considerably, so bear that in mind when you&#39;re perusing the menu online.Every dish was amazing. From the peach-coconut mimosas to the tiny bites of joy that were the buttermilk biscuits, to my favorite, the super trendy pork belly, we ate our way through what felt like half of the entire menu and it was glorious. Save this place for a splurge, but when you do get there, you will love every single bite.

My girlfriend and I were really looking forward to coming here and we were sadly disappointed. What went wrong:- We made a reservation for 9:30pm and after a long wait the only table open was next to the door and really cold. We ended up at a crowded community table. So much for a romantic intimate dinner.- The decor in the place was cold and barren. There are so many restaurants and bars in town that manage to make a place feel warm and friendly without spending a lot. The room at 1760 felt like eating in an office.- The food was consistently oversalted. We found ourselves gulping down water we got so thirsty. Especially bad was the kale. The chorizo / octopus, lobster and uni buccatini dishes were decent.- The drinks took forever to arrive and food got to our table first.1760, congrats on your buzz so far but we are definitely not coming back.

This is hands down one of the best restaurants in Nob Hill, maybe even in San Francisco. I&#39;ve eaten out at my fair share of restaurants and this one is definitely my go to. They change the menu with the seasons and are constantly coming up with fresh and innovative new dining options. (They also recently opened for brunch on the weekends and the french toast is incredible!) Mr. C makes incredible cocktails, seriously...they&#39;re all amazing! It&#39;s a very fun atmosphere and you can tell their entire team genuinely enjoys working there.

Skip this one. Really.The problem with 1760 is that they take some amazing ingredients and then mess them up. This goes all the way from the amuse bouche to the mains. The amuse bouche was a &#34;Spice Pressed Apple Slice&#34;. Seriously. it was just a slice of an apple. What restaurant does this?We had:Crispy Octopus - flavor wise this was nice, a Spanish style tapa. Too bad the octopus was significantly over cooked (= rubbery).Umi Pasta - Also under-seasoned, single dimension dish. It was average.Grilled Mackerel - this was nice and simple, well seasoned and fresh. Liked this one.Fingerling potatoes - these were regular potatoes with some avocado pieces. This was under seasoned. You can make better ones at home.If you&#39;ve eaten at great restaurants (Frances, State Bird, Coqueta, Bouche, etc) you will be disappointed here.

Really expensive for what it is. We were told to order at least 3 dishes per person. We ended up ordering 8 (including dessert). We also had one cocktail each (two total). The bill came out to $150 before tip.I don&#39;t mind dropping almost $200 on dinner but the food and experience has to match the price. For just a little more we could have went to their other restaurant, Acquerello, where food and service is way better. And even though it would cost slightly more, we wouldn&#39;t feel like we over paid.Our server was fine but she totally dropped the ball in terms of checking in on us. We saw her at the window people watching more than she was working.Food was good but nothing was great. The cavatelli ($17) was the worst dish of the night. The crab dish ($15) was the best. The bucatini with uni ($19) was a close second best.For dessert we had the peanut butter panna cotta ($8) sounds better than it tasted. Milk chocolate ganache ($9) basically was a deconstructed smore. It was good but not great.The strawberry shrub ($12) cocktail was awesome but it&#39;s not enough to off set the other issues.Like I said earlier, I would rather visit Acquerello next time.

Nice atmosphere, solid service and decent food. We know SF isn&#39;t cheap so we are always looking for VALUE at the end of the day ... At least I am. So when I&#39;m served tapas at almost entree prices, I better be blown away. Unfortunately I wasn&#39;t and that&#39;s why I won&#39;t be coming back. Mind you this place does not sucks, I just have better options in this foodie city.

Dimly lit, trendy atmosphere- perfect for a date night or a small group. Definitely not loud enough for a girls&#39; night (well, my girls at least)! They played inaudible soft music in the background, but when we were on our last dish, they played 2pac&#39;s &#39;To Live and Die in LA&#39;. Not sure if that was accidentally added to the playlist (for the record, I would love to be able to eat at a restaurant with 2pac playing in the background).Tapas style, so order 6 dishes for a party of 2. Dishes range from $16-$28. Don&#39;t be concerned by the small table, the food comes out 1-2 plates at a time. We ordered:Hamachi crudo - Good, lots of celery to give it a fresh crunchBeef tartare - Very good, and came with a super delicious herb salad with a thai vinaigretteBrussels sprouts - Tasty, with crumbled egg yolk on top. You can never go wrong with roasted brussels sprouts.BBQ pork belly - My fav of the night! Tender morsels of pork belly on top of some kind of yummy potato slaw sauce.Nori-roasted Potatoes - Definitely going to skip this next time. Great flavor on the potatoes with just a hint of nori, but there were only a few and I feel like I could make this at home.Fried duck sandwich - So yummy! Just enough bread (I hate sandwiches with too thick bread). Duck was delicious, not too much breading and didn&#39;t taste super fried. Went perfectly with the cole slaw.I didn&#39;t order any drinks but I heard from a coworker (also there on a date) that each one they ordered was a hit. I just might be back to try a few.We walked to Bob&#39;s Donuts after for some dessert.

I did the math. Between Jamie W. and me, we tried 35% of the menu. I&#39;m depressed. I felt like Chris Christie at an IHOP. But that&#39;s what they told us to do - order 2-3 dishes per person, so that comes to six out of just 17 offerings on the compact but wholly enticing menu. How could it not be enticing since it&#39;s the same team behind Acquerello, one of our favorite fine dining establishments in the city (my review:bit.ly/16vSWPC)? But the vibe this time is urban casual from the Nopa/Bar Agricole oeuvre of SF dining. Whereas Acquerello is hidden away on Sacramento between Polk and Van Ness, 1760 is front and center on the busy corner of Polk and Washington where hipster looky-loos couldn&#39;t help but gawk through the windows on their way to their regular watering holes (photo:bit.ly/1eT6fgy).Executive Chef Adam Tortosa may have come up with only 17 dishes (photo:bit.ly/18lhSFP), but judging from the six we had, he&#39;s nailed them. We were told that each dish was sharable and that the menu is intentionally ordered from lightest (Sliced Hamaichi) to richest (Fried Duck Sandwich). Tough choices so we needed libations to help us make up our minds. I ordered the $10 Peach Buck, a smooth-sweet mix of peach, Angostura bitters, star anise, nutmeg and bourbon (photo:bit.ly/17C0cJi). It made for a puckery-good refresher that complemented the amuse bouche, a couple of cubes of watermelon pressed with smoked paprika and wine (photo:bit.ly/15w8BON). They popped so easily into our mouths that our response was slightly delayed on the smokiness of the paprika.At this point, Jamie decided to get his own Peach Buck, and we indulged on our first plate, the $15 Dungeness Crab which was artfully placed in a crescent shape in a bowl of cold watermelon gazpacho that had a bit of a kick. The sea grass made a lovely textural contrast laid on top of the crab like wild sagebrush on the plain (photo:bit.ly/17BZFa6). The next dish was making its debut that evening, the $8 Brussels Sprouts grilled and sprinkled with particles of egg yolk and mint (photo:bit.ly/1aD6zgK). It was just the right note before the heartier dishes to come. The third dish was likely our favorite of the evening, the $18 Corn Ravioli, a half-dozen pillows of joy filled with corn and baked potato and sprinkled with bits of potato chips and chive (photo:bit.ly/1945PxM). Apparently it&#39;s the menu favorite, and we were told to pop them in our mouths whole to get the full burst of flavor. They were downright amazing...sweet, savory, juicy and gone in a flash.I ordered a second drink, the $11 Garam Masala-Cardamom, an exotic treat with a garam masala spice blend, thyme, orange oil, toasted cardamom and bourbon (photo:bit.ly/18li7AY). Ed was feeling no pain. The main events came next. First came the $19 Grilled Pork Belly, four good-size slices grilled and placed atop a fresh radicchio slaw and topped with sliced baby carrots (photo:bit.ly/18lh43K). While I prefer pork belly braised because it ends up more moist that way, the grilling still worked, and my perpetual pork belly craving was satisfied. Finally came the $22 Hanger Steak, the most expensive dish on the menu offering eight slices of steak smoked and cooked to medium rare and accompanied by a mix of arugula, grape halves and caramelized onions (photo:bit.ly/14YA8VC). Tender and good though I have to admit this was the least creative dish of the quintet served.Dinner was stellar, and clearly sampling one of the three desserts was inevitable. The choice was almost made for us since we were told they were not serving the Peach Panzarella that evening. In its place was a Peanut Butter and Jelly Panna Cotta which didn&#39;t get Jamie&#39;s motor running. We decided to try the $9 Milk Chocolate Ganache, which resembled a Michael Mina creation with a Playdoh-like log of ganache festooned with droplets of browned marshmallow, canelas of hickory ice cream (a smoked vanilla flavor), granulated milk chocolate and a bourbon caramel sauce (photo:bit.ly/167rumY). It made me dream of putting my mouth into the spigot from which the magical ganache came. By meal&#39;s end, we did feel like we ate 35% of the menu and in record time since we took the earliest reservation available (5PM). We weren&#39;t necessarily looking for an early bird special, although the service was extremely attentive at that juncture, a big plus.FOOD - 5 stars...superb small plates with very few errors in executionAMBIANCE - 4 stars...grab a table in the middle row to avoid the elbow wars that may occur at the banquette...love that the dining room is separated from the bar by a dividerSERVICE - 4.5 stars...very attentive and friendly with the daughter of one of the Acquerello co-owners serving usTOTAL - 5 stars...35% of the menu and worth every bite...an excellent addition to the local dining scene

mmmMmm this place is pretty delicious - def a fan!came here on a random tuesday evening, and the place was PACKED! we grabbed two seats at the communal table, which was perfect for us - its always fun to observe what&#39;s going down in the restaurant and to preview the food plates! teehee.we got - peppers, fried duck sando, uni, and the pork ribs. the fried duck sandwich was definitely my favorite, but boi didnt like it at all, saying that it was a bit bland, etc. etc. butttt i thought the flavors were great, and the slaw on it was the perfect touch. he reallllyy enjoyed the pork ribs, which i liked as well. tender, and perfectly saucy without being overwhelming.we tried a glass of wine each, and also 2 cocktails each. everything we ordered was delicious, albeit probably on the sweeter side each time. meep! haha..overall a great experience! and good for families and friends :)

Food is consistently very good. The little gem salad is reason enough to go back. The poppyseed bread with lavender butter is incredible. Service was way above average. Friendly, attentive and knowledgable on drinks and food. The cavatelli was not something I would order again. Didn&#39;t have enough flavor. Definitely order the carrots, roasted and seasoned perfectly.

I had made a 9:30 reservation to celebrate my birthday, and it was fairly disappointing that we were not seated until 10:40.We stood at the bar (as there were no seats available) and watched several tables sit absent-mindedly, having already eaten, and waited patiently for an hour and ten minutes for our table to be set up. Yes, we could have sat down after 40 minutes, when we were offered a spot at the community table, but it was my birthday and we wanted our own table. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s unreasonable to expect a table to ourselves at the agreed-upon reservation time.So we sit down finally, and we order, seeing as how we had plenty of time to look at the menu. 1760 does a lot of shared plates, so we ordered some items, and asked if it would be enough for us. The server said she thought so, but if we wanted we could always add more. Two minutes later she returned to the table and said &#34;The kitchen is closing, so if there&#39;s anything else you want, or if you think you&#39;ll want dessert later, you&#39;ll have to order now.&#34; We didn&#39;t order anything else.During dinner, we were given a complimentary order of the fingerling potatoes, which were delicious. By the end of the meal, we were stuffed, and even left a few bites on the table. And then we were given two desserts that we hadn&#39;t ordered, also complementary. Of course, we were full, so they were partially eaten. While the gesture was appreciated, it seemed it would have made more sense to comp either the cocktails we ordered while we waited, or the corkage fee for the wine we brought, or any one of the items that we actually ordered, rather than offering us something we didn&#39;t order to begin with, or couldn&#39;t finish at the end of the meal.In the end, the food was great, particularly the uni pasta. But the overall experience turned me off a bit. I know restaurants can&#39;t control the behavior of their guests, but surely it&#39;s within their power to suggest other reservations are waiting, and move them to the bar?

My experience here was definitely a mixed bag. We had a reservation at 5:30 PM last night and we arrived a couple minutes after to check in for our reservation. Unfortunately one person in our party was running 20 minutes late so after we checked in told the hostess we&#39;d just stand outside and wait. So there we were, standing right outside the big glass door, in front of the hostess, in broad daylight until our friend arrived. When we walked inside a different girl walked up to greet us and told us our reservation was &#34;marked as lost&#34; because we didn&#39;t show up. After explaining to her what happened, she was very accommodating and found us a table. The girl who helped ended up being our server and she was fantastic. Very attentive and knowledgable about the menu and different wine pairings. When it came to the food I can say it was very good, but I wasn&#39;t blown away by anything I tried other than the Fried Duck Sandwich. The duck was incredible and I&#39;d highly recommend it. This was a business meeting of sorts, and we&#39;d built up quite a tab by the time was all said and done. When we paid it came out to around $300.00 for 3 people. Not excessive, but it definitely wasn&#39;t cheap. What really topped off the whole night... Right when we paid, the hostess who checked us in and &#34;no-showed&#34; our reservation walked to our table and said &#34;If you guys would like to move I have a community table open but I&#39;m going to need to seat my next reservation here.&#34; I mean I&#39;m sorry but I was still drinking my glass of wine and just paid nearly $100 per-person to sit here and eat and now I was being rushed out of my chair. I understanding keeping to a schedule but overall the hostess at this place last night was just terrible. Zero patience and people skills. I really hope it&#39;s not this places vision to move her up to being a server. The service was actually really good and I&#39;d hate to see someone like her helping tables.

Small plates, a little pricey but overall a great experience and I would head back for dinner next time in town.The waitress was very informative about the dishes and wine. I think the best part was ordering the &#34;dealers choice&#34; from the bartender. The waitress asked about 5 questions about your drink of choice and the bartender mixed it up. It was a HUGE hit and the drinks were spot on.Also, we informed the waitress we had two people that were Gluten free. They wanted to let us know that certain dishes had soy (which has traces of G in it). She informed us which dishes they can change, which ones they can&#39;t.Ribs were amazingOctopus was amazingly goodDesserts were to die forAvoid the green salad ( its small and not worth it)

I came here yesterday after my friend had told me about her good dining experience. The menu looked tasty and I wanted to try somewhere new so my bf and I came to 1760. We ordered:- fingerling potatoes w/ avocado- octopus- macherroni w/ crab- uni bucatiniWe enjoyed the appetizers as they were super tasty. I especially liked the octopus so I would def. recommend that! I also liked the macherroni. It was cooked to the perfect texture and was creamy, but citrusy. The thing that killed our experience was the uni bucatini... We were both extreme disappointed. The noodles and uni were cooked with a cheese sauce that was reminiscent of velveeta. The combination of uni and cheese was just completely wrong. I picked at it, but finally gave up on the dish.We didn&#39;t opt for dessert so we just asked for the check. The combination of the food + the $80 we threw down unfortunately left me unsatisfied.

I love the ambience of 1760. I took my boyfriend here for his birthday. Reservations can be made pretty easily online @ open table. I made reservations for 2 the night before and they had our table waiting for us when we got there. we ordered 5 items. At first I thought we might not have enough food, but we were definitely stuffed! the uni Bucatini and gnocchi dumpling were super heavy. The pork ribs were pretty tender but they were super saucy so I wasn&#39;t as big a fan. Overall, the experience was great. I thought their prices were also quite reasonable compared to other SF restaurants. It&#39;s a nice upscale place, but not as fancy as fine dining.

Best dinner I&#39;ve had in a long time.

Whereas a place like State Bird Provisions felt like a waste of money.Wow. Also the food came out fast!Impressed with every dish. I went in with no expectations and left extremely happy.All the dishes were great that we had. The dungeness crab, pork belly, fried duck sandwich, corn ravioli, ribs, octopus, buccatini, desserts blah blah.Try it.

Came here when my cousins took me here for dinner. It was pouring outside when we came. When we entered the restaurant, I noticed it had a really trendy feel to it. All the dishes were very prettily crafted. We ordered the lobster ceviche, which was delicious. The beef short rib was pretty good as well. The meat of it was good, however it had a really strong celery taste, which I am not really a big fan of. The monkfish liver mousse was surprisingly good. I would recommend ordering it if you like Foie gras. Lastly, we had the chocolate ganache for dessert. It was delicious, especially with the graham cracker crumbs. Overall, it was a fun dining experience for me.

Was enjoying a somewhat mediocre meal, great environment, cocktails and staff!!! But...... In the middle of our meal when we asked for an extra rib to be added to our order, our waitress came back saying &#34;the only way the chef will do it is if we bought the whole kitchen a beer&#34;...... Are you kidding me? What a joke! Your a mediocre chef at a sub par restaurant and you want us to buy your staff a beer to add an extra rib? Your in the service industry try acting accordingly.... Stroke!Ewww and they give you the same wet wipes you get at original buffalo wings and joes crab shakes!

Get a few things to share but make sure you get your OWN ravioli, trust me on this! It is TO DIE FOR.For as good as this place is the pricing is not bad. We shared 5 items + a drink each for 2 people and the bill was about $110.

The lollipop kale with red currant sauce is out of this world, and I&#39;d never had anything like their mackerel with eggplant before.The drinks are great too. Try the blackberry mint drink or the lavender mint tea if you&#39;re looking for something non alcoholic.

Wow. Food was spot on. Cocktails were delicious. Must order the uni buccatelli, pork belly, lobster ceviche, fried duck sandwich. We also ordered other dishes, however, I can&#39;t remember which ones. It&#39;s not cheap but I find it worthy.The food servers described what was on the plate before eating. I feel like the pictures won&#39;t do the dishes&#39; justice. One disappointing dish was the potato dish. It was SO tiny. One bite and you&#39;re done. We had 3 people total sharing lots of food and I remembered this one being the awkward one of who should even attempt taking a bite. We shared one dessert; dissemble banana peanut butter bread with ice cream. I was so full that I felt like I didn&#39;t enjoy it to the fullest, but damn, it was a cool dish. It wasn&#39;t your typical dessert plate.In conclusion, I&#39;d love to come back here with other friends. I&#39;d recommend at least 3 to a group so that you can try everything without over stuffing yourself. I saw couples in the center isle. It made the restaurant romantic.

I loved the menu and the restaurant had a great ambiance. Very cool, upscale but relaxed. Our waitress suggested that my date &amp; I split four or five plates, but we weren&#39;t super hungry so we got three - the shishito peppers, burrata, and crispy octopus. It turned out to be just enough food - when they say small plates they mean SMALL. If I&#39;d actually been hungry I might have left unhappy. Or broke. Definitely plan to get a lot of dishes. The shishito peppers were my favorite - they were nicely charred and had a good kick - but the octopus was also amazing. Everything was cooked perfectly and was full of flavor.We had a few of the pear-ginger and peach buck cocktails too and those were both excellent. Our waitress was attentive and I liked that they brought out one dish at a time. Knocked off a star because portions are small for the price (even considering how good everything was. It really isn&#39;t more than a few small bites of food per dish), but the food was very creative and they use a lot of ingredients that I don&#39;t encounter often. I really, really like this place and will definitely be back to try a few more things.

Our waiter suggested 3 dishes to share for 2 people but we ended up ordering 5 dishes and 2 cocktails with 1 dessert to share. The dishes were excellent but not very big. I loved munching on the shishito peppers- they were so addictive and yummy! The nori crusted potatoes, Hokkaido scallop with uni and caviar, crispy octopus and beef tartar were simply AMAZING!To end our delicious savory food we shared the milk chocolate ganache, it was sooo good!!!Definitely recommend this place and will be back for more :)

Ok, so you know that &#39;hot new guy&#39; in the office that could get away with stealing your lunch and cutting you off during a meeting? Well I feel that&#39;s how 1760 is right now.It&#39;s the handsome new guy on Polk street, and boy does he stand out.The interior is clean and modern. With high ceiling and glossy counter tops with ample spacing between seats.However, the food and service lacks 1769&#39;s authentic charm. The food is good, but portions are small than expected and costly. There&#39;s no &#34;wow&#34; stand out dish but everything is decent.The service on the other hand seemed not in sync. I get that they are new and trying to find a rhythm that works but they will need to find it soon. For example, my friend who ordered the fried duck sandwich was patiently waiting for her meal while i got the Uni pasta first. As we sat at the table with the Uni pasta dish in front of me, no server stopped to ask if they would like for us to bring out the sandwich. Instead, when we flagged down our server to ask where her meal was, he replied &#34;oh we like to pace our meals and didn&#39;t want to crowd the table&#34;.

Trendy and open layout of a restaurant with a very cool bar area and giant windows lining the entire exterior of the place. Our waitress was fantastic and was always around but never over-bearing. She offered some helpful and honest suggestions on drinks and food.The food: some dishes were world-class, while others fell very flat, especially for the high price. What we loved: the Caviar, the Lobster Ceviche, and the Crispy Octopus. The Caviar came in a spoon and melts in your mouth. The Lobster Ceviche was a very light and fresh dish and was a great transition into the rest of our meal. The Crispy Octopus was tender and crispy, not tough at all, and came with what I would describe as a mildly spicy jumbalaya filler.What we would avoid if we came again: the Buccatini and the Hangar Steak. The Buccatini just tasted like glorified mac and cheese and the uni really didn&#39;t go well with it. The cheese was very over-powering. Hangar Steak was probably the most disappointing dish. You only get 6 thin pieces of steak with a side of arugula. And the steak was a bit overcooked in my opinion.The price: This is my problem with the place. It&#39;s very over-priced. I&#39;m ok with spending some extra money on caviar and lobster because I know that doesn&#39;t exactly come easy or cheap for a restaurant. But what really sent me over the top was the $28 for the Hangar Steak. 1760 are you really going to charge us that much for 6 slices of mediocre beef and then only give slightly-dressed arugula as a side? Either replace the steak with Kobe Beef or give me some more caviar with it if you&#39;re going to charge $28.Our meal for these dishes and 2 drinks came out to be $160 before tip. In my mind it should have been about $50 cheaper for the food that we got.We both decided that we would come back for drinks and maybe a quick bite if we lived in the neighborhood, but wouldn&#39;t go out of our way to spend that type of money again.

I think I just found my new favorite restaurant. There&#39;s so many places to try in SF but this is a place that I would definitely come back to again and again. Consistency is key for me and every dish we ordered was continually better than the last. Their popular Fried Duck Sandwich was actually my least favorite (but still very good!) and it looks like they change their menu seasonally. It&#39;s always a good sign when there&#39;s so many appealing things on the menu that you&#39;re having trouble narrowing down what you want to order. Service is also very attentive and friendly. Be sure to make reservations.

I love it here. Consistent good food and good service. Everyone knows this is the ultimate recipe for a great experience. I recommend this place to anyone I come across. Lobster ceviche is a must have and order at least one if you&#39;re a party of two or more! The ever changing complimentary snacks are a nice touch. The changes made to the uni bucatini since the beginning is even tastier. Basil drink is the fave on the menu. You really can&#39;t go wrong with ordering. I just tend to over order and rarely get to dessert. Enjoy! See u again soon 1760!!

Hard to pick a favorite, but the lobster ceviche was pure rapture.And if the food weren&#39;t enough, our waiter threw it way over the top -- so knowledgeable, attentive, and beyond darling. I don&#39;t know his name -- but you know who you are, you tall, slim, shoulder-length light brown hair, adorable person, you.Cocktails delish, too. Go for the Stirring Hour, and stay for dinner. I promise you won&#39;t be disappointed!

Normally, the words &#34;small plates&#34; send me out the door of a restaurant faster than &#34;salmonella.&#34; But I am forced to make an exception when the food is unique, gorgeously presented, and absolutely delicious. This is the case at 1760.For several months, my husband and I waited with our noses pressed to the glass, in hopes of a great new restaurant in the Parilla space. We weren&#39;t disappointed. Everything we ordered was outstanding. Also has a very good bar - special shout-out to the Yuso-Shiso (I probably spelled that wrong) drink - a distinctive taste you have to experience for yourself. I could have knocked back five of these. They can make them in an equally (okay, *almost* equally) tasty non-alcoholic version. It&#39;s hard to get a table here, but if you arrive early enough on a weeknight they may still be able to help you, or possibly seat you at the community table. We don&#39;t love the famous duck sandwich - too gamey tastes, but everything else is phenomenal. Definitely get the s&#39;mores dessert, and enjoy a &#34;small plate&#34; dinner worthy of your money.

I&#39;ve been to 1760 3 times and all three were quite divine. There are too many creative dishes to expand on and I see that other reviewers have done just this. If you haven&#39;t tried it, I encourage you to check it out. The flavors, uniqueness and creativity of most every dish makes this a fine, fine gourmet restaurant. I actually like it better than Acquerello. I think it&#39;s much more exciting and cutting-edge creative with new, unique flavors and combinations of tastes.

Went to 1760 the other night with fairly high expectations since apparently it is the sister restaurant of Acquerello. We enjoyed ourselves but the food was hit and miss. I&#39;ll start by saying I really liked the vibe in the restaurant. A lively and diverse crowd gave the place a fun energy. Our waitress was very helpful too.We came with a group of four and started with drinks and beer. The cocktails were fresh and different, we thought they were really great and a good way to start the meal. The wine list is great but many of the wines are pretty expensive, at least 75$, which seems outrageous I would not expect that going to a small plates restaurant. Way overpriced. Oh the tech boom in SF.As for food, the lobster ceviche was outstanding and probably the best thing we ordered all night. The peppers were a huge disappointment, so bad we sent them back, something I haven&#39;t done in years. We also shared the corn ravioli, ribs, duck sandwich, octopus, and baby artichokes. Everything besides the baby artichokes I&#39;d rate as 4 stars. Nothing really to knock your socks off but good flavors, and I&#39;d probably order all again. A little strange they put peanuts on so many dishes here, like peppers and ribs, didn&#39;t care for the peanuts at all, very bizarre.Overall I&#39;d say it was a solid 4 stars. The food was unique (almost to a fault) and the cocktails were great. If we go back I&#39;d just be a bit more conscious of the alcohol tab, it got a bit overboard.

1760 elevates the Polk Gulch food scene with innovative takes on Italian classics and a world-class bar and wine program-- it is truly not to be missed.From the moment you check in with the hostess, Isabella, you are transported to a warm, yet unmistakably stylish dining experience that could easily be in Milan, New York, or Tokyo. How fortunate for San Francisco that this treasure is here! The service is impeccable and attentive, with your needs tacitly intuited. Coursing is appropriate and not rushed.The seasonally-inspired menu is delicious and changes often, so I can&#39;t comment on particular dishes, as I haven&#39;t been back to 1760 in a few months due to travel. Whether you&#39;re a pescatarian, staunch carnivore, or vegan, 1760 easily accommodates your preferences. My husband had his bachelor party dinner here [at the communal table] and all attendees were delighted with their experiences, despite their varied palates and dietary needs.In addition to being a lifelong gourmet, GianPaulo, the proprietor, is one of the most knowledgable, yet unassuming oenophiles and happens to be a trained sommelier. Don&#39;t hesitate to consult him on your wine selection-- he is a wealth of information without any snobbery whatsoever and will be mindful of your budget.In short, head to 1760 for any and all conceivable occasions. I think I&#39;ll make a reservation for this evening myself!

Excellent. The octopus was the best I&#39;ve tasted - perfect; light crunch outside, amazingly tender inside; paired with chorizo paella - delicious.Chocolate ganache also excellent - icecream, crumble, mallow to assemble a very posh smores.And very intriguing cocktails - tried a couple, both very good.

Food was good but did not wow...Shishito peppers were yummy with the miso sauce. Palette was treated to an explosion of flavors. Watch out, though, cuz you may get a really hot one (like I did). Be sure to have your beer or water nearby.Brussels Sprouts in black vinegar with hazelnuts and prosciutto was just OK. I&#39;ve had much better ones. The sprouts were not roasted enough for me. They were more like steamed/boiled. I prefer them roasted with the outer leaves caramelized and crispy.The Kabocha Ravioli in a light coconut broth was deeelish! Pop the entire ravioli in your mouth with the broth and be treated to a mouthful of creamy sweet kabocha that tastes nutritious, fresh and light. (Ravioli flavor changes with seasonal vegetable)Roasted Baby Carrots were nicely caramelized and sweet.The Grilled Pork Ribs in hoisin bbq sauce came right off the bones and melted in our mouths with a very slight kick at the end...nice.Favorite dish of the evening was the Grilled Pork Belly...melted in our mouths with the right amount of lean and fat. So flavorful. Wish I knew how to make this dish. Just thought portion was small compared to price.The strawberries with charcoal cake was...well, not sure what to say except the cake actually had ground up charcoal in it that tasted gritty.The cocktail menu is quite eclectic. I had the Pear-Ginger which boasted an enormous Campari ice cube that slowly melted. It was like 2 drinks in one. If you like ginger and grapefruit flavors, you must get this one. I may drop by just to enjoy another one, or two, of these when I&#39;m in the city.Our server was superb! She explained all the menu items and made sure we had all that we needed throughout the evening.Tip:Everything is meant to be shared. Starting from top of menu, items range from light then increasing to heavier as it goes down the list. Menu changes seasonally, but some items are mainstays although they may change slightly in preparation or accompaniments.Make reservations.

This place is weird and way overpriced. We just happened to stumble in here while walking down Polk looking for a place that had some open seats and this is what we found. My date orders a bowl of cooked whole peppers. I thought peppers were more of a side type dish that you eat in addition to an entre or meat or something but no, this was served by itself like it was an appetizer. She also got these corn ravioli things that were tiny and came like 5 on a plate for $18. Neither food item was that good but charged us very premium prices. Our waitress was also weird and totally in our face (Jamie?), but whatever. The only decent thing I had there was my drink. It was some spicy Indian bourbon drink and it was actually really good and balanced. I was pretty impressed. But then again, it cost me $14 so it better be. Food is lame, drinks are decent, I won&#39;t ever go back.

A neighborhood knockout.From the magnetic minds of Acquerello, comes a perfect sister addition that Polk desperately needed.The space is open, inviting, and exudes of sense of understanding of the people it serves.A long bar runs down the line while seating dots the larger half of the restaurant.Christopher Longoria spearheads the bar and has developed a confident and imaginative drink list. Allowing each of the spirits to shine, there never lacks a desire to continue to sip down the list.Personal favorite: The Peach Buck.The food is playful, and can be correlated to the appetite of your choice. Small dishes allow you to cultivate your own playlist with the Fried Duck Sandwich as the crescendo. This sandwich is lethal. Incredibly rich, with a strong spicy kick with the slaw, it has easily become a weekly tradition.1760 has been a long time coming. As a resident of this neighborhood for years, I am thrilled to have this addition to an already incredible location.

This place is a great &#34;go to&#34; as it ticks all the boxes. Good service, good ambience and good food (loved the potatoes). I felt it was also good value for money. The key word for me clearly is &#34;good&#34;. It is a good place for casually sitting at the bar or dining at a table with friends. The waitress was very mindful to cater to our needs and make sure everything went smooth. It&#39;s not a mind blowing rave about experience, but I think it&#39;s one of the better restaurants in SF. Would confidently recommend to our friends.Sarah

Super happy I finally made it into this neighborhood gem! My roomates and I were able to walk-in at 7pm on a tuesday and get seating at the communal table. We decided to split the brussels, crispy octopus, BBQ pork belly and duck sandwich. Everythind was DELICIOUS and nothing was ordinary. Even the brussels were special with the addition of crumbled egg yolk and crispy onions. The pork belly was a flavor explosion in my mouth. The octopus was simulatenously juicy and crispy and I loved the addition of the peanuts. My least favorite was the duck sandwich just because I thought it was incredibly rich, but it sounds like that is everyone else&#39;s favorite so what do I know??What a great addition to the neighborhood! Polk street definitely needed a little class and 1760 is serving it.

We really enjoyed our experience at 1760. The menu is fascinating and meant to be shared.Hamachi crudo, lobster ceviche, roasted carrots, Nori roasted potatoes, and bucatini (uni). Warm banana bread w/chunky monkey for dessert.Everything was really tasty. I could eat the lobster ceviche everyday all day.The atmosphere was classy yet casual and had a younger vibe. Service, top notch. Highly recommend!

I was here on Halloween so as you can imagine, there were a lot of interesting characters inside and outside. I had a strawberry cocktail as well as a slew of dishes. They had this crab avocado dish which was delicious. Everything else was just ok. Service was lacking. Our waitress was nice but was much more interested in what was going on outside. She spent about half or the time we were there standing in front of the window like a cat starring outside. She would be there for 15 minutes without moving. I was a bit surprised that after doing that repeatedly, management didn&#39;t say something to her.

1760 was one of the final stops on my birthday train.We came in on Saturday, 9/14 and found out they just opened that Monday. WHAT?! With almost every table full, and the professionalism of their staff, you would have thought 1760 had been established for years.Caro S. &amp; I were sat at the large community table at the front of the restaurant. Community tables are my new favorite thing. I love to people watch, and this is the perfect excuse to do so.Because we were celebrating, we started with drinks. I enjoyed the Strawberry Shrub so much, I stuck with it for the evening. It was not as fruity as the cocktails I typically drink, but really refreshing. Caro opted for the Mango &amp; Spice. I think our drink orders fit our personalities pretty well.I let Caro take the lead when ordering, because I&#39;m definitely known as the picky one. She did not dissapoint. While I didn&#39;t have any of the ceviche (see her review for more on that), and didn&#39;t care for the greek yogurt with sauteed peaches, I did enjoy everything else-Salad w/hanger steak, caramelized onion, grape and arugula: pretty sure we were fighting for bites at the end. I think next time, we&#39;ll have to each order our own.Gnocchi: So good, I practically liked the bowl. The gnocchi was accompanied with pork belly and a red sauce. For my humble pallate, it was a nice spin on spaghetti and meatballs.Then Robert, our server told me that since it was my b-day, dessert was on the house. Say what?! I ordered the Angel food cake with strawberry and brown sugar whipped cream. You read that right... Brown sugar whipped cream. Before we dug in, we both sampled the whipped cream to test the potency of the flavor. Three words- Oh. Em. Gee! SO good!! There was a strawberry drizzle with basil seeds over the angel food cake. The flavors complimented each other amazingly.Thank you Robert, 1760, and Caro S. for making my birthday so special.

I was super stoked to try this place after hearing all the hype about it and finally getting a reservation, but it actually didn&#39;t meet my expectations.The space is gorgeous, and the service is good, but the food wasn&#39;t as amazing as I expected it to be. Don&#39;t get me wrong, it was tasty, but just not as great as the hype let on. I ordered the hamachi crudo, the uni pasta dish, the brussel sprouts, and kale lollipops. The vegetable dishes were very flavorful, but the hamachi crudo didn&#39;t wow me, and the pasta was a tad dry and lukewarm. I won&#39;t completely write it off and am willing to try it again, but this time around I wasn&#39;t too impressed.

I came here for my 21st birthday dinner with my father and one of my older sisters. We ordered about 6 dishes. The price for three people came out relatively reasonable considering the extremely high quality of food, service, and ambiance.EVERY bite of EVERY dish wasn&#39;t just tasty, it was like art. I can&#39;t stress this enough. The first bite of every dish forced the corners of everyone&#39;s mouth to curl up in a tiny, involuntary smile, which then made us burst into smiles and laughter because we all noticed eachother&#39;s similar reactions. That&#39;s how a proper dining experience should be.Service was sweet and friendly and super helpful. Our server walked me through all the drinks on the menu and explained each dish as they came out. They all had a really good sense of humor while maintaining super high standard of professionalism without being super stuffy and snooty. The drinks were bomb too (although they were not cheap).They bring out a pallet starter (can&#39;t remember the exact term they used for it) beforehand. Can&#39;t remember exactly what it entailed, but i remember there being an edible flower involved, so I was all about that. Actually, a lot of dishes had edible flowers, which, like i said, are super cool to me personally.We ordered: lobster ceviche (omg just saying it makes me emotional/nostalgic), brussel sprouts (super noms), artichoke hearts (ughh yes please), the crab (double ughhh yes so lemongrassy and flavorful), burrata (super good, but then again, I&#39;ve never been disappointed with burrata before), and finally the asparagus ravioli. I feel like I&#39;m forgetting something important here. Oh well, whatever it was, I know it was great because nothing I ate was just &#34;oh this is pretty good&#34; it was all &#34;WTF IS HAPPENING TO MY MOUTH IT FEELS LIKE A SUNRISE.&#34;Actually, we didn&#39;t order the asparagus ravioli, but I think because they weren&#39;t ready at 8pm on the dot (they were only like 5 or 10 minutes late to seat us though)/it was my birthday/the chef was feeling &#34;generous&#34; we got it anyway. That was probably the best thing besides the ceviche. It was like a soup dumpling, except ravioli. You put the whole piece in your mouth, you bite down, and ravioli explodes (not violently or messy or anything, but in the best way possible) in your mouth and every corner of your tongue is covered with the creamy, yet light flavor.Anywho, my father, my sister and I are definitely coming back here again, but next time we&#39;re bringing my snooty foody sister from NYC because she saw all our pictures on instagram and facebook and got really jealous and requested a visit. We&#39;re also bringing our cousin from NYC, but I don&#39;t really know his standard for food so I guess that&#39;s an insignificant detail.Overall, it&#39;s a high ranker in my personal top 5 favorite places I&#39;ve eaten at in SF.

Sprucing up Polk Street...Had a fabulous dinner date on a Friday. With no rezzies we chose to sit at the communal table and enjoyed the pleasant service just as much.For starters we went with two varietals of Pinot Noir, brought over and served by their in-house som who was fantastic.For grub we went with:- Lollipop kale (green crunchy goodness)- Hamachi crudo (topped with orange- tasty but I&#39;ll probably order the lobster ceviche next time)- Corn ravioli (a party in your mouth)- Crispy octopus (tender and savory)Presentation was elegant yet not ostentatious and the flavoring was on point throughout the meal. Four stars in my book!

3 Words. Fried. Duck. Sandwich.That is all you need to know if you are considering making a trip to1760.1760 is quickly building a great reputation in the city. With a great cocktail program and a solid wine list, your adult beverage cravings will not go unsatisfied.For the food - I&#39;m not sure where to begin. 1760 is focused on small to medium size plates that are meant to be shared. On our most recent visit we had the brussels sprouts, the octopus, a salad and the fried duck sandwich. All of which were excellent. The duck sandwich definitely made me want to come back the next day.One thing to note: the menu is set up well for a table of 4 to share a lot of food. 2 tops will only be able to try 3-4 dishes and after you stare at the menu for 10 mins, you&#39;ll have a really tough time making a choice!!!!

The best dining experience! From beginning to end. EVERYTHING we ate was amazing. The best is that everything came with enough for the 4 of us to share a taste. It was so fun to talk about how delicious everything was and why. We ordered caviar (a must), lobster ceviche, corn ravioli, artichoke, pork belly, octopus, duck sandwich. We each had several drinks and shared 3 desserts. Portions are made to &#34;taste&#34; so don&#39;t be afraid to order a lot. This is worth every penny...

This place offers one of the hippest experiences you would expect from a new San Francisco establishment. They offer a lot of creative (and delicious) cocktails, and the decor while minimalist is very modern and not caught up in the cliches of Edison Bulbs, Mason Jars, and Rag Napkins.What really sets this place apart from the rest is their treatment of flavors. While other restaurants seem to be drawing inspiration from the same playbook, 1760 is offering something new kind of like how the Read Option was a new offense that took the NFL by surprise. The other restaurants all seem to be offering similar takes on the new &#34;it&#34; proteins (Braised Short Rib much? for example), while 1760 isn&#39;t afraid to take an ingredient and prepare it in a more interesting way.Here I feel like they are a lot more experimental with their flavors, which might be a little bit of a shock at first and dare i say, maybe a little offputting. But this is where I&#39;ll defend it as a place that &#34;underground&#34; foodies should go. Where a place like NOPA might be upfront and obvious with its use of flavors, so that even a diner who only goes out for special occasions can appreciate the use of new and interesting ingredients, a place like 1760 might be more suited for someone who understands subtlety and unconventional combinations a little more. (No knock to NOPA, I think that place is fantastic but I think might be for a different audience)For example, for our complementary bite, we received a slice of apple that had been prepared with a dash of tamarind sauce. In my mind, I thought that this would have gone down the tart direction. But instead they flipped it around and actually highlighted the sweetness of the apple. If blindfolded and not told what I was eating, I could&#39;ve sworn I was eating persimmon. That really got me on my toes and prepared me for the rest of the meal. The short rib I had was so tender, but at the same time browned to create a nice almost crisped texture. The last time I had something like that was at Benu.The prevalent theme I discovered across all the dishes we tried (the Scallops, the Fried Octopus, the Short Rib, Ravioli Uovo) is that they were all elegantly plated and their treatment was more of an approach to flavors that homogenized them instead of having certain ingredients dominate as the overarching flavor. It was a subtle approach that challenged me as a diner and left me wanting more. I will certainly go back and recommend this place to anyone who is sort of jaded by some of the other dining options that are out there, but still looking for that cool and upbeat city vibe.

My favorite place in the city. So much better than all those other over-rated, must wait months for a reservation restaurants. Every dish is delicious which you get a chance to try since its small plates. My favorites are the Brussels sprouts and pork belly. A lot of people Iike the duck sandwich, but I find it too heavy/filling. It&#39;s good, but if I want duck I don&#39;t want it overly sauces and dressed. The wine list is amazing, but it gets pricey once you start with the alcohol. This place is amazing though. A must try!

Oh my goodness the food here!I&#39;ve found it&#39;s rare to find a restaurant where every dish you order is just as delightful as the last. We ordered the following:lobster ceviche, hamachi crudo, fingerling potatoes, burrata, corn ravioli, and bbq pork belly. My two favorites were the corn ravioli (surprising explosion of warm sweet flavor) and the pork belly. The flavor in all of the dishes was very unique...and so good!For dessert we had the strawberries and cream...very light for a dessert, but packed with a lot of flavor! Perfect ending to a wonderful meal.The service was also very good...the dishes came out one at a time in a very timely manner. We rarely waited very long in between dishes. All of the staff was pleasant and very knowledgeable about the menu.We will definitely be coming back!

Lots of windows let in just enough light at night, and the very tall ceilings make things seem less cramped. The bar looks great too. Our waitress was so friendly and helpful. She definitely went above and beyond.The food was excellent. The two main dishes we ordered were the Pork Belly and the Lobster Ceviche. Both were awesome, but I especially enjoyed the Pork Belly. Everything we ordered was very good really. Great place to take a date.

I absolutely love this restaurant! It&#39;s in fact one of my favorites in the city. The food is always exceeding my expectations (and they tend to be high), and you can literally close your eyes, point at anything in the menu and trust that it will be delicious. I especially love how they combine ingredients in each dish to create rich amazing flavors that are just amazing. I&#39;m giving 5 stars to the wonderful culinary experience, the flawless service, and really good drinks. The atmosphere is also lovely. It&#39;s a perfect place for a romantic date or dinner out with friends. It&#39;s always a great choice. Oh and let me not forget, order the duck sandwich! It&#39;s amazing. And no, it isn&#39;t (or tastes like) just a good ol&#39; sandwich.

I was unexpectedly surprised by 1760. While I can&#39;t say there was one thing that really blew me away about this restaurant, I must say that it had all of the elements that make a great night in my book.The EATS: Everything we ordered was really good: Crispy Octopus, Cavatelli, Lollipop Kale, BBQ Pork Belly, and Brusells Sprouts. Roasted Brussels Sprouts are always good, but their addition of aromatic herbs, crispy onion, and egg yolk was like crack. The dishes may have been a *tad* over-seasoned, but it was also tasty, so no complaints here.The VIBE: This may turn others off, but I loved that this restaurant played hip hop. Not loud trashy radio or booty shaking hip hop, but old school rap/hip hop with enough melody to blend in as &#34;background music&#34; to those who won&#39;t recognize it. Keith Murray told me &#34;The Most Beautifullest Thing In This World&#34;.. is just like that.. uni bucatini. But sadly, this wasn&#39;t on the menu when I went. The menu is somewhat seasonal, but I hope they bring the uni pasta back soon!The SERVICE: Our server was young and rough around the edges, but what he lacked in finesse he made up for with friendliness. I&#39;m not sure I agreed with his drink recommendations, but that&#39;s somewhat subjective, so no hard feelings.With so many restaurants in the city to try, I rarely ever go to the same place twice. But I may just have to make a repeat trip to 1760 one of these days!

Came here last night for a friends birthday dinner. We ordered a total of 8 dishes (including 2 desserts) for 3 people. None of us being overly famished, this was the right amount of food.Now granted conversation was so good, it does become hard to concentrate on the food. But I will say nothing really stood out to me. There never was a pause of...&#34;Wow, that was amazing!&#34; As a matter of fact the opposite in 2 cases. But I am still giving 4 stars for good reason, and I do recommend this restaurant.I wasn&#39;t a fan of 2 dishes: The brussel sprouts were a little too drenched in soy sauce and became soggy. Although good flavors were there, they need to work on the sogginess factor.The second dish that no one at the table enjoyed was the Bucatini uni. I ordered this because I read good reviews for it on Yelp, but I must say it was excessively fishy and really lacking another other flavor besides the ocean. Maybe we had a bad batch of sea urchin, I don&#39;t know.We also had the smoked pork belly, which was very good. The hanger steak with arugula and grapes, which was probably my favorite for the night. Whatever that brown puree was (caramelized onion maybe?) with the steak was phenomenal. And the grapes were a nice way to freshen up a traditional steak dish.We also had the hamachi dish, also good. The steak tartar, although not my favorite steak tartar in the city (Wayfare Tavern holds that record), it was still delicious.We couldn&#39;t decided on desserts so we ordered whatever the chocolate option was and the panna cotta take on PB &amp; J. Both were good.Wine selection (by the glass) was limited, but the options were enough. Service was on point all night. The staff there really know what they&#39;re doing, I appreciate that.Overall, I had a good experience. None of the dishes really blew me away, but I will come back after they have been open for awhile. Give them some time to get into a groove and perfect the dishes.

My favorite dish would be the lobster ceviche ! Yumm. Atmosphere is not bad. Love the high ceiling. The only complaint that I have is that their menu is a little small for me. Went there for the first time between 2 people and I think we tried about 70-80% of their menu already. They say that their menus changes but I&#39;ll have to see the next time I go back. Heads up parking in tough this area.

Yum yum yum...This place is an experience for the taste buds...Checked out this spot with couple of gf&#39;s after we all heard good things from others..We started out with the lobster ceviche which was a refreshing cleanse for the pallet .....The uni pasta was a full mouth of buttery richness and the octopus was a flavorful chewiness....Our finale was the duck sandwich which was less memorable after all the previous stimulus...I do recommend talking to the sommelier as he provided us with a well balanced fruity Italian red that was within out price range and complemented our food.Overall a experience worth coming back to...

Eh, I&#39;m conflicted. I&#39;m thrilled Parrilla is gone and a beautiful new restaurant took its place.PROS:It isn&#39;t Parrilla.Beautiful restaurant.Friendly, knowledgeable wait staff, bar included.Interesting, well balanced cocktails.Tasty foodCONS:WAY overpriced. I&#39;m not cheap, but the prices, for what you get, are ridiculous.Very limited wine menu, and nothing under $11 a glass.Teeny tiny portions. Like, SUPER small.Really loud, difficult to carry a conversation.No Grey Goose or Bulleit. For shame, people.We had 2 cocktails each, two plates and a dessert, had a bill of $100 and left hungry.In summary, I would go back if:A., I wasn&#39;t very hungry andB., I wasn&#39;t paying the bill.

So happy our sommelier friend from Acquerello recommended this place to us!I&#39;m giving 1760 4*stars because they are still new and there is definitely room for improvement. For example, their lighting could be a little dimmer as it struck me as being quite bright when I sat down. Tables are quite close to each other, but at the end of the day its a casual restaurant and as long as the food and service is good, who cares?For someone who is not a big fan of Gin, I would love to see at least one more vodka based cocktail on the menu. With that said, their cocktails and food are both delicious. There was not one thing I disliked, which is always a good sign.Memorable dishes*:Cavatelli with pork cheeks in tomato sauce - this was a WINNER for me and I would come back just for this dish.Uni Bucatini - I&#39;ve had hundreds of uni pasta dishes and this was one that I actually thought was executed well and tasted delicious. The Uni and pasta ratio could be improved by adding just a little more uni so you are not left with plain bucatini - albeit cooked perfectly. Wouldn&#39;t expect any less from Acquerello&#39;s new gem.Dessert - Milk chocolate ganache - this dish was basically a play on deconstructed S&#39;mores but with caramel and bourbon ice cream. Need I say more? The presentation was creative and I loved the addition of a few mint leaves on the ganache so you can get minty smore bites as well! Pure genius.*Will definitely be back to try the fried duck sandwich sometime.

This place is great. Ladies night with the girls, we got a table for 4 on a Saturday night no problem. Everything the server recommended was amazing (food + drinks!) and we had just enough food for all of us. 2 of the 4 are vegetarians and there was plenty of option for us all. I find it oddly difficult to find good vegetarian food in the area so I will for sure be back here.Looks like it would be great for a date night as well!

Highly anticipated? Yes, especially since 1760 is such a refreshing change after Parilla. Showed up for opening night.The restaurant itself is beautiful. Unfortunately the bar area is a bit narrow which pretty much means you aren&#39;t getting a seat unless you show up early. Very crowded.Service was great. Either the manager or the sommelier was incredibly helpful in picking out a great bottle of wine. The corkage fee is outrageous ($35) but the wine list is substantial. Would be nice if there were more moderately priced bottles but there is still something for everyone...mostly.Small plates ranging from $9-22. Lots of choices for the meat and seafood eaters. We enjoyed everything we ate but you definitely need to order at least two plates per person.Had a great time but it will be a while before we return for dinner. Probably try the cocktail menu next time. Very expensive meal for two. Looking at around $200.Great addition to the neighborhood regardless.

Invited to 1760 for cocktails and appetizers. We sat at the community table.The cocktails were great and the bartender was friendly. Food was for the most part delicious, just not quite worth the high price tag. Very small portions. Octopus was the highlight.Our waitress however was pushy and abrasive. She pretty much ruined the night with her obvious upsells and constant hovering for ordering more food/drinks.Would not return.

Fantastic! We came here last night as a belated Christmas present and I couldn&#39;t have been more satisfied with my choice! Everything we tasted was EXCELLENT! I appreciate the level of attention our waiter gave us (including remembering to ask if either one of us had a food allergy). We started the meal with a couple cocktails and then immediately dove into some small plates.For &#34;not dessert&#34; we split the tartare, crudo, maccheroni, carrots, and lobster ceviche and for later we each ate or own sweet (ganache for me, and warm banana bread for him). Honestly, the flavors were so complex and delicious my mouth was watering after every bite. I would say the chef has a strong affinity for citrus in each dish so if you are not keen of lime/lemon I would urge you to try a different restaurant.My personal favorite plate was the maccheroni; my god, the intensity of the crab and lime was tongue tingling; I literally cannot stop thinking about this dish. Plate to skip would unfortunately be the tartare; while I feel like it was good, I don&#39;t believe it brought anything to the table I hadn&#39;t tried before (but don&#39;t get me wrong, still delicious).Price point wise, I thought it was a tad on the expensive side for a 23 year old who is not making 6 figures in San Francisco but still completely reasonable. 7 plates, 4 drinks, and tip coming to just under $200 really isn&#39;t that bad. I would love to come back again!

American tapas, I want to call it. Basically small plates with fresh ingredients and made with care. The place is small and cute, and they seemed to pay attention to the food. I had several plates to try and share:Dungeness crab -apple, celery, yuzu, &#39;siracha&#39;Lobster ceviche- caramelized coconut , pineapple, corianderBrussels sprout - crispy onion, aromatic herbsCrispy octopus -roasted peanuts, avocado, potatoesHanger steak- caramelized onions, grape, arugulaGrilled pork belly- gigantic bean, radicchio slaw, carrotsBucatini- uni, garlic, red pepper, bread crumbFried duck sandwich- slaw, pickles, spicy aioliPeanut butter panda cotta- berry jam, milk crumbleEvery thing delicious, with the few exceptions:The fried duck sandwich was good, but not the greatest at all. I just didn&#39;t like how it was tasting, it was heavy too. Uni pasta was only okay, not the greatest I had. The panna cotta, I thought was a disaster, the flavors just didn&#39;t meld well together.Overall, great food, not sure if it hits five stars.

Amazing.Always packed, and for good reason. Our server and runners and bartenders were very attentive but not interruptive, the ambiance was classy but hardly pretentious.Ranking of entrees goes as follows:1. Octopus paella - best dish ever!!!2. Burrata3. Uni buscatini5. Corn Ravioli4. Dungeness crab5. Chocolate ganache6. Shishito peppers7. Duck burgerThe cocktails were fun too. But as with the food, don&#39;t expect too much portion for your buck. You&#39;re paying for taste, presentation and a uniquer-than-norm experience... Not quantity.

Everything about 1760 was so great! Such a fun atmosphere (sat at the communal table with a big party) with plenty of amazing dishes and great service.Favorite dishes/cocktails (it&#39;s hard to pick from the list - it was all good!):Meyer Lemon Fresno Chile cocktail was super refreshingShishito Peppers - could snack on these for foreverCrispy OctopusPork BellyALL the seafood - Tuna Sashimi, Lobster CevicheService:The sommelier was knowledgeable and happy to recommend some really great, reasonably-priced wines. The waitress talked us into Fernet shots at the end of the night since we decided to forgo dessert and they were delicious. Not your regular Fernet Branca - this was much better.To sum it up: you need to come here multiple times and order the whole menu, or come in a big group to taste everything. It&#39;s worth it.

Corn ravioli is the star. It is a must have. About 7 one-bite raviolis come in the order, they burst with a creamy corn filling that is on another level. I gave my boyfriend the side-eye for asking to have another one off my plate. Brussels sprouts, duck sandwich, and watermelon gazpacho were all winners too. I loved the basil punch of their 1760 cocktail. Small portions but the flavors are stellar and worth the price. Cool modern vibe and decor.Oh and the milk chocolate ganache dessert had me ready to lick the plate. Still in a food coma from this dinner, will come back with more friends.

Service was great! Very friendly staff and food came out nice and quick. The food was delicious! Although for anyone who hasn&#39;t been the food is more like tapas so I recommend ordering two per person, or else order a few and charge them among everyone at the table. Their cheesecake is heaven on a plate! The places itself is pretty cool, nice low light and not too noisy.

How did this place get 4 stars? 3 of 4 dishes were bad. The octopus was great, but the crab, bucatini, and duck sandwich were terrible. Drinks were good, ambiance good, service good. My review is purely about the food because that is why I go out to a restaurant. $118 for one of the worst meals of my life.

in three words, our experience was: Overpriced. Lackluster. Disappointing.My husband and I have been wanting to try this place since it opened. It&#39;s always been too busy for us to get a reservation at a reasonable hour on a night we&#39;ve decided to go out. We&#39;ve figured that, because it&#39;s always busy, it must be good. The menu usually looks pretty appealing. We finally went last night because my brother was in town visiting. Given the overall rating, I was hopeful that it was be a great meal... we were sorely disappointed.After telling the waiter it was our first time at the restaurant, he urged us to order &#34;two or three items per person,&#34; which seemed ridiculous to us, given the prices on the menu ranging from $9 - $42 a plate. We ended up ordering three items -- the lobster ceviche, the fried duck sandwich, and the pork belly (plus the $5 bread and whipped pork fat, which was 5 small slices of bread). My husband ordered a cocktail.When the lobster ceviche arrived, we understood why he told us to order more food. The proportion was miniscule.. and for $19... ridiculous. I was also turned off that the menu didn&#39;t indicate that the ceviche had cilantro in it--some people (including me) have a major aversion to cilantro--and it turned me off of the dish completely. It&#39;s one word. Add it to your menu if it&#39;s in a dish you&#39;re serving. While the duck sandwich and pork belly were more reasonable entree proportions, they were not worth the price tag. Pork belly is a hot menu item right now, and a place with prices like this should nail it....but it was off--like it had been sitting under the heat lamp for a few too many minutes. It was room temperature when it arrived at our table. The duck sandwich was good, but not great. Our bill was over $100, and we left hungry--ending up going elsewhere for more food that didn&#39;t cost an arm and a leg.Our service was as lackluster as the food. Once our waiter realized we wouldn&#39;t be racking up a $500 bill (just a $100 one, as it turned out), our service felt rushed. We had multiple, different people delivering food and bussing our table. My husband told our waiter not to take his unfinished drink, and moments later, another man walked by the table and snagged his unfinished cocktail without asking. The only kudos I can give our waiter is keeping our water glasses full--considering that was the only thing my brother and I were drinking.There are way too many choices in the city for a place like this to survive. Maybe there&#39;s a market out there of clientele that can afford it, but it certainly isn&#39;t &#34;affordable&#34; by any means, and I don&#39;t think it belongs in the neighborhood. Sad to say, we will NOT be returning to 1760.

Honestly, this place gets way too much hype. It is absurdly expensive for the little amount of food you&#39;re getting. I will say that the food is good, but I went with a friend, didn&#39;t get drinks and we still payed $70 each and were still hungry after. One might say you&#39;re paying for the experience since its a beautiful venue, but maybe reserve this one more for a fancy night of going out for a drink, instead of the food.

Nice atmosphere here and great location off of Polk. Obviously a very busy and trendy place currently. The food was excellent and the drinks were delicious. Everything is a small plate so you need to order 4-6 items for a group of 2-3 people.I minus two stars for service and flow:-Things started poorly at the bar as we ordered our two glasses of wine and it took over 10 minutes even though the bartender acknowledged us waiting way too long. They were waiting for their &#34;wine guy&#34; to come over and pour us. How about you not make me wait 10 minutes and just pour me a glass of wine?-As we sat down, our server was obviously flustered (although very sweet) and throughout the meal things just arrived late and out of order. This was exemplified when our waitress forgot our crab dish which came out 15 minutes later than everything because she acknowledged that she forgot to put the order in. Mmmmm...okay.Dessert was excellent. The strawberry and chocolate dessert was ridiculously good.Overall, I understand being overwhelmed and making mistakes but I feel it would have been appropriate to acknowledge the issue further and comp a dish or a drink along the way. Taking $10-$15 off for multiple mistakes isn&#39;t anything off your end and the thought always goes a long way for me from a service perspective.$200 out the door for 5 main courses, 2 desserts, and 2 glasses of wine.Might try this place again in the next year but not jumping out of my seat with some many other great places in town!

Polk Street continues to transform (for better? for worse?) with newly-arrived 1760, the sister, more &#34;casual&#34; dining experience to Acquerello, a restaurant I have yet to dine at.The place was abuzz on a Wednesday night, as many people wanted to check out the venue. My table of 4 was told that the menu was meant for sharing, and the menu was organized from &#34;lightest to heaviest.&#34; We all started off with drinks, but I was the only one to have a cocktail. The sommelier was knowledgeable and rattled off facts about my dining partner&#39;s wines, which was pleasant. My cocktail, the Basil Mezcal Sour, was absolutely delicious, and is definitely getting me on the Mezcal train.We ordered quite a bit- 2 plates as appetizers, then with each person ordering 2 plates (a total of 10). The shishito peppers were deliciously salted and blistered. I personally had the brussel sprouts and charcoal raviolo. The first was delicious-- super crispy, and topped with a crumbled deviled egg.However, the raviolo was a bit underwhelming. I learned this from another fine-dining experience, but in case you didn&#39;t notice, &#34;raviolo&#34; means you are only getting one piece of &#34;ravioli.&#34; Yes, it&#39;s a larger piece of pasta, but just don&#39;t be surprised if you order it. The pasta itself is gray (Charcoal?) and filled with a nice, runny egg yolk. While it was very satisfying to break into the raviolo to get to the runnyness inside, I have to say that the pasta itself was a bit too &#39;al dente&#39; for my liking. Another friend got the raviolo, and mentioned it was her least-favorite plate. The meat-eaters in my group got everything from ceviche to tartare and the duck sandwich, which they all seemed to enjoy.We also split 2 desserts, which was another mixed bag. We all loved the Brown Butter Cake, but felt that the Peanut Butter Panna Cotte was a bit weird, texturally. (It&#39;s served with Jam and white chocolate, so almost like a PB&amp;J?)The service was decent, and we weren&#39;t made to feel rushed, as we were able to sit around and have conversation, even after the check was all paid. Overall, it was a satisfying meal. I didn&#39;t leave feeling hungry (as others had mentioned) but in all honesty, nothing wowed me enough to necessarily say I would go back, unless it was for a cocktail.

Definitely a high end dining experience all around. The service was amazing and the food was unique and delicious. We got 7 dishes for 4 people, and I left satisfied, but not full. The 1760 cocktail was amazing and the uni pasta, burratta and corn ravioli were my favorites. Make a reservation!

I am impressed. (4.5 stars)I gotta say I wasn&#39;t a huge fan of Acquerello due to their lack of.. imagination and some questionable choices on their tasting menu that I had last year. But because I enjoyed their pasti and appetizer-like dishes so much, I was pretty pumped about their new casual spot right around the corner.A friend of mine and I ordered totally of 6 dishes (5 main + 1 dessert):Bucatini with uni, cavatelli with pork cheek, ravioli with corn, duck sandwich, dungeness crab gazpacho.The ravioli and duck sandwich were out of this world good. I mean, thank god their octupus was out of order, because we asked our awesome server for a recommendation and she picked the ravioli..The atmosphere was really nice, and the service was tight..The only reason why I am not giving 5 stars is that the dessert wasn&#39;t really up to expectations. I actually remember getting the same dessert at Acquerello, and their desserts were our least favorite parts of the whole dining experience.I will definitely go back to try other dishes!

One of my favorite restaurants on Polk street. Trendy atmosphere with super nice bartenders and servers. Cocktails are creative, sometimes almost too pretty to drink. My favorite is the pear and ginger. I&#39;ve probably tried almost dish, but always order the shishito peppers. The quality and presentation of each dish is consistent and each is beautifully prepared. I also love the chocolate ganache - it&#39;s a deconstructed smore and one of the best deserts I&#39;ve eaten. I also love the music - sometimes during a late dinner they play 90&#39;s hip hop (but it&#39;s not loud or distracting).

Decides to try this out because House of Prime Rib had a 2 hour wait. The staff here are very friendly and helpful. The menu is simple and light but there is a method to their madness. The different items all have different tastes so it&#39;s hard to give an overall grade for the food. Definitely not a good place to being groups. This is more of a place to go on a date. With that said this place is almost perfect mainly because of the inconsistency in food flavor, but makes it up with the atmosphere.

This place is fantastic. Food is always on point and consistent. Ian has been my server several times and he is INCREDIBLE. Amazing service and personable. Thanks 1760 for always providing consistent service and food!! Try the caviar bites, they&#39;re divine.

After a second visit, I&#39;m even more impressed. It&#39;s hard to find pasta made so well and the small plates really are outstanding. Add that to a limited, small-producer wine menu (w/the purveyor on hand to chat) and it&#39;s clear 1760 is doing a lot right.

I went there for my friends birthday. Food was interesting, unique and fresh. We have carrots which were really really good. We also have brussel sprouts that were surprisingly delicious. Everything was served on small plates. I also really like the interior of the restaurant it was very modern and clean. Overall we had a great time. This is a good place for a date or a special occasion.

Loved this place! I originally tried to book it for a date night but it was too hard to get a reservation. I ended up bringing clients there for a team dinner. The food is served tapas style which is fun for a group and you get to try really unique dishes. The cocktails were also fantastic and had great combinations. I had the Pear-ginger which I highly recommend. My fave dishes were the Brussel sprouts and crab Mac n cheese! Delicious. We also had a banana bread desert and chocolate ganache that was like a deconstructed s&#39;more. Incredible. Great service too everyone was nice and attentive. This place would be good for a date, girls night, and even for work.

Despite the great food and wine and the beautiful remodel, the customer service completely ruined the experience for me. Taking into the account it&#39;s supposed to be a nicer restaurant with higher prices, that MUST be on point (I mean, that&#39;s half of what you&#39;re paying for, right?)To start off, we ordered two drinks. One of the drinks came right away, but 10 minutes later, no second drink. We had to ask again, and apparently they forgot. Took them another few minutes, and no apology or anything. Annoying, but still fine. The breaking point was when the bill came. They charged us for the wrong drink, which happens, but when pointed it out, their response was awful. I politely pointed out that he had put the wrong drink on the bill, and he looks at my with annoyance and goes &#34;are you sure?&#34; (this wasn&#39;t even the same guy who poured the drink, so how would be know?) When I told him what I got, and what was on the bill, he then responds with &#34;Well, they&#39;re the same price.&#34; Umm, WTF? Seriously? The drink he charged us for was a higher price, and even if they were the same price, that was a super rude response. We pointed out the price difference, and he gave us a fake &#34;sorry&#34; and walked away. Overall, I walked away from here really annoyed we had just spent a lot of money and gotten horrible customer service. Will not be back.

Man, this place was pricey but well worth it! The meal consisted of the Hamachi Crudo, Dungeness Crab, Brussels Sprouts, BBQ Pork Belly, and Bucatini. I enjoyed every single bite, but my favorite was the Hamachi. It had a perfect blend of flavors with a nice little kick of spice. The cocktails were also great. I had the Pear Ginger, but my boyfriend&#39;s Garam Masala-Cardamom was quite tasty as well. Topping off the excellent meal was the excellent service. The staff was very welcoming, kind, and attentive from the moment we arrived to the moment we left. The hostess even helped me put my coat on. Top notch in every way.

Great place for small plates and cocktails before a show or the movies. I loved the crab, brussel sprouts, and steak tartare dishes. But my favorite by far is the Duck burger! Its rich and flavorful and perfectly cooked. My husband and I split the burger which was more than enough when its paired with other side dishes. Also had the banana bread with Chunky Monkey ice cream and dehydrated peanut butter (like fancy Butterfinger flakes) which was to die for! All told, the bill without cocktails was $70... not bad for San Francisco prices!

This place is awesome! I&#39;ve been waiting for a decent restaurant to open on Polk, and this is it! They completely remodeled the old La Parilla, and it looks so clean and modern, with lots of natural lighting. We ate at the bar, and the bartenders were so nice and knowledgable about the food and the drinks. Christopher is their head bar guy, and he was great.The food is small plates to share, and they are so yummy - the beef tartare, the warm potato salad, and the fried octopus were amazing! So much flavor, and not too heavy. Its all a bit pricey, but in my opinion, it is worth it. The only downside is that the wine list is limited, with the cheapest glass costing $11 - maybe they&#39;ll expand on that later on. All in all, awesome new place in SF!

I had the pleasure of dining at 1760 as well as a small handful of &#34;top pick&#34; restaurants across foodie blogs on a recent trip to SF. 1760 was absolutely the highlight of my entire trip and one of the best meals I&#39;ve ever had. Coming from Vegas, the new land of celebrity chefs, I&#39;ve enjoyed the Robuchons, Jose Andres, and Mario Batali&#39;s of the world... 1760 just raised the bar. With each plate you imagine that the next won&#39;t be able to surpass the last but the food continues to surprise. Absolutely loved it.

I had one of the most amazing dining experiences here. I had 5 dishes from their menu and they were all equally amazing. I had the Bucatini, potatoes, Short Ribs, Octopus, and the Duck Sandwich. The short ribs were so tenders and the octopus and duck sandwich were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Our waiter was very nice and had all our dishes come out in a certain order. It was like a symphony of flavors starting with the potatoes and ending in a grand finale with the Duck Sandwich. The restaurant was packed which is indicative of how popular it is. After that meal, I can definitely understand why. It was one of the best dining experiences I&#39;ve ever had in SF.

Let me start by saying that I have been to 1760 twice and I have noticed a sharp decilne in the overall food experience. Our party was composed by four european adults, and we all had similar negative feedbacks by the end of dinner: 1760 is rapidly becoming more focused on its appearance than its substance. Example: a waitress hired to decant food like a muse becomes a joke when the menu itself doesn&#39;t support (for either quality/quantity) her effort. &#34;Folks, our menu is family-style (a phrase I can&#39;t stand anyway since it reminds me of the Olive Garden&#39;s Tv ads) and I&#39;ll recommend to order a few plates to share among the four of you&#34;. To start, we decided to share a Lobster Ceviche and a Burrata. The Ceviche arrived in a plate the size of Texas. Imagine looking at the map of Texas and locate the city of Dallas in the center: all in proportion, that was our micro Ceviche! With a renewed &#34;spirit of family&#34;, we asked for a magnifier lens and we split it in four! Next the Burrata. With great joy, Burrata is becoming more and more popular nowadays. Burrata is a delicate and simple milk product from the Puglia region of Italy. The beauty of some of the simplest italian food is its genuine flavor. The dish presented at 1760 was everything but simplicity: the poor Burrata was hidden under a quarter pound of yellow/red peppers, and trapped with some mint on top of a Pugliese bread slice. Few more unidentified objects layed on top of it. Don&#39;t get me wrong, not a bad appetizer, but don&#39;t call it Burrata, since you couldn&#39;t taste it at all. Instead, call it Peperonata (which is a real italian dish made with peppers)! Our group at this point decided to abandon the decanted &#34;family style concept&#34; and move on as hungry individuals to attack the main entrees: incredibly enough we all ordered the same. Cavatelli pasta with smoked lobster mushroom drowned in tomato sauce! Not complaining about the quantity on this occasion (it would have been different if we had to share this again) we focused on the quality: 2 stars at the most! The ingredients per-se weren&#39;t bad, but they didn&#39;t blend well as a whole. In other words, we could taste every single ingredient without being able to appreciate the final product. The sauce didn&#39;t stick to the pasta, just like going to a concert where the acoustic is bad. Sure, the band is famous, you can hear the electric guitar, the drummer is explosive but you can&#39;t understand the singer and the result is not harmonius. This is how we felt when we left. In such a food-competitive environment, good luck to 1760.

The portions are very small, especially the tuna. You could finish the entire tuna dish in two bites. It was FREEZING in there. A lot of people were wearing their coats inside. The place is completely bare-bone, I suppose they are going for a minimalist look. They need to step up with their portion size and do something more inventive. This place just didn&#39;t do it for me. So many better places in the city.

Great ambience and service. Good for romantic date, double date, small-group putting, or when your parents come to town. I&#39;d treat it as a special-occasion restaurant. The burrata on toast was simple and delicious. The corn ravioli popped with earthy sweetness. The Dungeness crab with cantaloupe broth and cantaloupe sorbet was as fussy as it sounds, but fun. The cavatelli with tomatoes and mushrooms was a bit off, but I&#39;m not quite sure why. The drinks, wines, and desserts were all special.

Where to begin? Should I start with the ambiance? The muted, simple, and modern decor? The service? The wine? The refreshing cocktails? Nope, although all of those are 5 star - I&#39;ll start with what it all comes down to, the food. The chef and his talented team have managed to put together a menu filled with creativity and have executed it brilliantly. I&#39;ve already been twice in the first week and I&#39;ve been remarkably impressed with how well things are going given the recent opening. Let&#39;s get down to the details:Sliced Hamachi - Delicious, fresh, great raw fish dish.Shishito Peppers - you can find these on many a menu, but the inclusion of ground hazelnuts sprinkled atop the peppers was a welcome additionBeef Tartare - With marcona almonds and chilis. One of the best dishes on the menu. As someone who rarely orders beef tartare, not only was I pleasantly surprised, but I would absolutely order it again. A signature dish to be sure.Corn Ravioli - YOU MUST ORDER. This dish will take you back to your childhood. Home cooking comfort food in a sophisticated modern dish.Warm Potato Salad - Again, ORDER THIS. It&#39;s something I&#39;d never think of ordering at a restaurant but it was DELICIOUS. Smoked egg is a perfect complement to the potatoes. Do it.Fried Duck Sandwich - THE SIGNATURE DISH. IF YOU ORDER NOTHING ELSE, ORDER THIS SANDWICH. It&#39;s perfect. Slaw, pickles, spicy aoili. I want one right now. Imagine a Bake Sale Betty&#39;s Fried Chicken Sandwich with duck. Next level ish.Take me back to 1760.

Greasy and salty explains every dish. I was excited to try out this new restaurant, but underwhelmed by every aspect of the experience. The staff was eager to smile, but fell short when it came to describing the menu. A standard script was given by each waitress (we cycled through two) and the food runner when we asked about their favorite dishes. The brussel sprouts were cooked beyond recognition, over salted, and flavored with an excessive about of oil. The duck sandwich was tasty, but also dripped grease and left my mouth dry from salt. The one saving grace was the tuna sashimi. My visit made me miss the days of La Parilla. A cheap and dirty mexican restaurant that delivered tasty food without the contrived grey paint job and the over priced food.

Not only the food was really good but service was top-notch. You do have to try the pork belly that was marinated for 3 days, then cooked for 3 more days... the brussels sprouts were a nice, nice surprise, I normally don&#39;t order brussels sprouts bu these ones were to die for... something else to die for: the cinnamon custard, so leave room for this. Their wine selection is great and in general, one of those places that you will just come back over and over

This is a newer restaurant that is definitely still working on perfecting their menu. However, the chances they take are commendable and generally very delicious. If you are looking for something new and interesting, you should check this place out, just don&#39;t expect perfection just yet. The space is one of my favorites in SF, very open with large windows. Two highlights were the hamachi crudo and lobster macheroni.

I had a nice valentine&#39;s day date here recently. I absolutely LOVED the Caviar dish. They really did a good job of incorporating the Uni. The lobster ceviche was delectable as well, it was an interactive dish. We nearly had half of their menu. The lollipop kale was fun and a little off the beaten path of kale dishes. Nice use of the soy sauce with this dish. The one dish that was not as impressive was the Uni macaroni. They dish was way too heavy to be paired with Uni. Uni is so buttery and unique by itself, the cream sauce in this dish drowned out the lightness of the Uni, this dish made me sad, I felt like I wasted the uni. We also had the bucatini but that dish didn&#39;t stand out. The octopus was highly recommended but I wasn&#39;t impressed by it. It was fried, a little on the dry side and nothing to write home about in my opinion. We had the chocolate ganache caramel dessert which looked more like a piece of art than food. I had the pear ginger campari cocktail that was surprisingly on the sweet side... I usually love sweet girlie drinks. next I got the Disaronno cocktail (when was the last time I saw disaronno!!!) and it was alright. I agree with a previous post, the interior reminds me of NOPA without the top floor, the bar and glass partition is very similar. Maybe I&#39;ll be back for the fried duck sandwich and the monk fish liver which they were out of. Top service and unique casual attire on the servers. Overall a successful night.

Lobster ceviche, burrata and pork belly were fantastic. Brussel sprouts were good, but with almost every restaurant serving their own variation these days I thought 1760&#39;s were ok. Lamb cavatelli was not great--soupy and the cut of meat wasn&#39;t very good. Cocktails were ok but a little too sweet for my taste and pricey.

I was so excited to try this restaurant. I made reservations and came with friends who have an 8-month old baby. The hostess couldn&#39;t have been more rude when we arrived. She told us that we would have to hold the baby during the entire meal because the restaurant does not have high-chairs and there would be absolutely no place to put the stroller. I am disappointed in hostess&#39; attitude and the reaction to a baby. I have been to much better restaurants in the city that are more than accommodating. We did not stay for dinner and I have no intention of coming back, even without a baby.

I have been here twice since it recently opened and both experiences were outstanding. The service was helpful and attentive, and the food was visually beautiful and tasted wonderful. I think the sizes were good and don&#39;t understand the comments about being too small. For the quality of food and experience, it is actually not expensive for this type of meal in San Francisco. My favorites were the corn ravioli, potato salad and uni pasta. Without hesitation, I would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a great meal with very good service.

The food is very good, but the cocktails are.. wow. I had the best Martinez of my life here, I asked to have it made with an old genever they had in a clay bottle and it blew me away.

Service was great, and the room was nice. They got pretty much everything right except for the food... completely underwhelming mediocre food. Some dishes were passable like the shishito peppers (which was the best thing we ate), but others like the the octopus and crispy duck sandwich were surprisingly not good. The duck got lost in the bun and drown in the coleslaw. I don&#39;t quite understand what the peanuts brought to the octopus. The pasta dishes were all meh. Adding uni (which I love) could not save the bucatelli. And pork cheeks could not save the cavatelli. I don&#39;t even mind small portions if they are delicious. There really was no cohesion of flavors to these dishes.

Came here on a week night. We sat at the row of tables for two, but felt like they were a little close together. The staff was super accommodating when we asked to move to a more private table, even with a couple dishes and drinks already down. The food was tasty and interesting, different than lots of dishes at other restaurants. Our favorite was the lobster ceviche, and the octopus was also excellent. The service was great and they had nice touches like folding your napkin if you left your seat. Two things they could change are spacing out the small tables a bit more so people aren&#39;t on top of each other, and removing the utensil boxes from the tables. Seems odd to have a box of forks and knives sitting at the table for what is otherwise an upscale casual place. They even said the box had to stay at the table when I asked if we could move it. Recommended for the food and service though!
