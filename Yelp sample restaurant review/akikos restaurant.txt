I&#39;ve been trying to go to Akiko&#39;s Restaurant for awhile now, and I tried a same-day reservation, but they were all booked. Thankfully, I just happened to be in the Chinatown/Financial District neighborhood around 11:30 AM, which is exactly the time that they opened. My business colleague and I walked in and asked for a table. Although they asked if we had a reservation, and we said no, they accommodated us, with the caveat that they needed the table back at 12:30 PM. I didn&#39;t take this as a slight but, rather, as a sign of how in-demand and exciting this place is.I ordered the lunch only sashimi with salmon teriyaki, as well as two pieces of the Uni (or sea urchin) from Santa Barbara. For information purposes, the lunch sashimi comes with four pieces of sashimi and, honest to god, every cut of fish tasted so fresh, so buttery and just out of this world. Even my cooked salmon teriyaki had beautiful flakes of tasty skin sprinkled on it, as well as this nice sauce.Moreover, the servers were always attentive. My only gripe was that the tables were a little too close for comfort, as I had a hard time exiting the table, and I&#39;m not even an overweight person.

EVENT: my sister is visiting from a far, far away land... and her favorite cuisine is Japanese... and so we made reservations for 3 people at 8pm.LOCATION: a cute little place... we couldn&#39;t find the sign for the restaurant and we assumed... it was at this place! It kinda looked a Japanese place we thought.. lolPARKING: close to Union Square, so we decided to take an Uber... plus we wanted to have some drinks.SERVICE: we had an AWESOME water guy... we were soooo thristy! He kept on coming back to pour us more water! LOVE the water boy! 5 stars to him!FOOD: we weren&#39;t as hungry cause we were kinda starving at 6pm... so we had a little snack before heading to this place. But - here&#39;s what we got...(1) Sashimi Tasting, $34: came in five different fish... in 12 pieces.(2) Nigiri Tasting, $24: six piece of nigiri... love it how they use just a little bit of rice... is it brown rice? The fish looks really shiny when it came out!(3) Negi Toro Roll, $20: this is one of my favorites! Toro with shiso leaf in a sushi... loveeee! 5 stars!(4) Negihama Roll, $10: yellow tail with some cucumber sushi - very simple and clean(5) Asahi 20oz, $9: pretty good price for a restaurant!**OVERALL - must get the Negi Toro Roll and Sashimi Tasting!

Man this place is tricky to find when you&#39;re tipsy lol....I definitely got lost because there&#39;s no clear sign. If you see an Irish Pub sign pointing towards a direction, that&#39;s basically exactly where this is located.Great food and service, definitely on the pricier side but treat yourself, you do you!. The raw fish here are very fresh and their cooked dishes are quite tasty also. The highlight of my night was their Hokaido Uni, LIFE CHANGING, best uni hands down. I had climaxed and didn&#39;t eat anything after that just to end on a good note. Their seared salmon sashimi and white tuna belly were also my other favorites of the night.Their omakase is pretty pricey here, though they don&#39;t tell you the set price on the menu which is tricky and can be quite dangerous. I&#39;d advise just ordering what you know you like on the menu to save some money.

A bit on the pricier side (refer to the pictures I posted; that came out to about $95).Very small restaurant, but when you are traveling for business, you have the option to sit at the sushi bar ;) and not wait long for a table. Score !

Came for dinner with reservations for 4 on a Friday night, place was pretty packed. Friends did prix fixe menu of omakase fish but I&#39;m not the biggest raw fish person.Tried their some of their dishes and it was very flavorful and unique. Snow crab nigiri - super fresh and tasty. Futomaki - good though nothing out of the ordinary.Friends&#39; highlights: wagyu beef nigiri, scallop nigiriTLDR: highly attentive service, great place for raw fish lovers!

As the suggestion of my BFF Peep, I ventured over to The City to try Akiko&#39;s. First off and losing a star is that there is no signage. Kinda a speakeasy sushi bar? However, once inside, you had better have a reservation, since it is packed! Started with Umni Masu, Scallop, Tako, and Shiro Maguro nigeri. Followed up at ta Tekka roll, Scallop Sunomono, and Deep Fried Softshell Crab. All were good and the service was attentive. Servings of the fish were on the smaller side, not what you get in Japan, however well prepared. With the abundance of sushi in San Francisco, Akiko&#39;s is a reliable stop.

I had dinner reservations at 6pm. I arrived a couple minutes early and the friendly hostess seated me immediately. My friend came in about 3-4 minutes after. The waiters stood in a row and tried to stop him from walking in, until I waved to him and he pointed that he was with me.The ambiance is really small and loud. The table is plated nicely and artistically. The waiters were very attentive with refilling my water cup as soon as I took a sip.We ordered:--12 piece sashimi tasting $34It consisted of assorted tunas, salmon and other exotic fishes. It was a nice thin portion for sashimi. Each piece was juicy and melted in my mouth. My favorite might&#39;ve been the fatty salmon.--Tekka Roll $12Tekka Roll consisted of tuna, scallion, avocado, crispy shiso, pickled carrot and sesame. This roll was new and interesting to me. The tuna was fatty and juicy. The rice had the perfect texture and the crispy shiso gave the sushi a nice crunch. It was delicious--Green Tea and Black Sesame Mochi $2.50 each pieceI&#39;m not sure if these were made in-house but they were creamy and perfectly sweetened. The mochi skin was thick and sticky and paired really well with the ice cream.The food was decent, but the service was meh (except for the hostess). No friendly smiles or thank you or goodbyes as we were leaving. Maybe they didn&#39;t want to say bye so they could look forward to saying hello if we return

My best friend and I spontaneously came across this restaurant while yelping for a good place to eat walking distance from Union Square.We walked into Akiko and were immediately greeted. However, what caught us by surprise was that the greeter asked us if we had a reservation. I did not read other yelpers&#39; tips prior to walking in, so I had no idea that we had to have a reservation. I explained to her that we just came across the restaurant on Yelp and it was just for the two of us. She looked around and seated us right away. (Yay! Granted, we did walk in at 5:30PM on a Thursday, so it wasn&#39;t THAT crowded) ((Note to future self: make a reservation beforehand!!!))Our friendly waiter, Alan, offered us water and gave us ample time to go over the menu.What we initially ordered:1 edamame2 Ji-kinmedai nigiri (nice salty &amp; buttery taste!)2 Amaebi nigiri (crunchy and buttery taste!)1 order Kuromatsu nigiri (meaty &amp; the melt-in-your-mouth type of fish!)1 Spider roll (nice and crispy taste without that weird shellfish after taste!)2 Sayuri sakeFirst round of nigiri was so good, flavorful and buttery! However, what really stole our hearts was the Kuromatsu nigiri. My best friend said we should order another nigiri, but I opted for the 5-piece sashimi. When it came out, the dish legit sparkled with the fish oil and they were presented on the shishio leaf with radish. It was so good, my friend and I totally forgot about our sake! Turns out, Alan had forgotten to bring it out to us.He apologized and brought it out for us and said the sake was on him. We were surprised and felt that he truly did care about the experience we were getting at Akiko.Long story, short:(+) excellent quality of food(+) amazing service (ask for Alan! He gives great eating tips and can provide you with really good recommendations.)(+) great selection of sake/wine/(+) menu organization between different fish with clear descriptions(+) presentation of each dish was on point(-) a bit pricey, but it&#39;s San Francisco. $10 for one nigiri was a little over my head since I hail from LA.(-) no complimentary edamame or miso soupOverall, I would give this place 4.5 stars, but bumping it up for Alan&#39;s amazing service, tips and the quality of food! Will definitely come back... with a reservation next time! Thank you for the awesome dinner and experience!

Came in to do the omakase and basically just asked for the most interesting/colorful/weird fish they had. Here&#39;s what I got!1) Japanese Thai2) Copper river salmon3) Halibut4) Striped trivali jack (hamachi)5) Ai Yu - in chinese markets, they usually have fried trout without teeth... this is the sashimi version. Funky and I like it. I can still taste that salty/fishy flavor but in a different texture.6) Baby barracuda - first time having barracuda! Yum..They were all good and reasonably priced for omakase.Ended it with with two of my favorites in one...&#34;Chu-uni&#34; = slightly seared Chu-toro (fatty tuna) topped with Hokkaido uni.I will say that it isn&#39;t the best fatty tuna I&#39;ve had but that&#39;s not what they&#39;re known for, so it is what it is!Service was amazing. I felt like I was having a conversation with the chef even though I wasn&#39;t sitting at the sushi bar...which is how omakase is supposed to feel like, a chef taking you on a journey.

Top-notch fish! i.e. possibly among the closest I&#39;ve gotten in my life to the sushi that Jiro dreams of. Comparable in quality to those uber-authentic sushi places in LA&#39;s Little Tokyo.The fish menu was amusingly similar to wine, with the name of the fish, place of origin, and categorization of white fish (&#34;mild, clean&#34;) vs vibrant fish (&#34;full flavor, buttery&#34;). To extend the analogy to wine flights, they do offer omakase and sashimi tasting for the undecisive and/or high-maintenance.Sake king salmon (Marlborough, New Zealand, $8 nigiri): The salmon taste and fattiness was more attenuated than I had expected, based on my experiences with cooked king salmon. It&#39;s different from your typical sake, though it does require some thought and patience to notice the subtle complexities: first an interestingly firm texture, then unraveling nuanced salmon flavors, and a buttery finish. I was slightly disappointed with the small cut, but this was a pretty memorable piece of fish.Spider roll ($10): One bite and you feel like all the previous spider rolls you&#39;ve ever eaten was a hoax fabricated of batter and sauce. Akiko&#39;s version puts the softshell crab boldly in the spotlight (for once), supplemented by touches of tempura, soy sauce, avocado, and sushi rice that had a stronger mirin taste than usual.Saba shio-yaki with chives, ponzu-daikon,charred lemon ($12): I&#39;m usually not a huge fan of saba, but I was a huge fan of this dish! The saba is everything you expect of saba shioyaki (robust, roasty, buttery), minus the usual negatives (overly fishy, salty, greasy). The additional ingredients synergistically contributed tangy and umami overtones. The texture was well constructed as well, with the fish infused with the sauce, a layer of soft daikon, topped with fine strings of (what I believe are) chives (but looked like moss). And props to the decent sized portion!Akiko&#39;s has fantastic attention to detail, which really brings the overall dining experience to the next level. There are numerous little things, such as chilled soy sauce, fresh authentic i.e. very strong wasabi, and quality wooden chopsticks (so you don&#39;t taste raw wood or plastic with every bite).The main aspect of Akiko&#39;s that didn&#39;t fly was its hodgepodge ambiance. First of all, they initially seated us in this random table right by the entrance next to a pillar, even though we had a reservation. After asking to move to the back area where there were tables open, we noticed that the room appeared very confused--three walls are covered in a wallpaper print that looked European, while the fourth wall was bare stone with exposed metal pipes. It also didn&#39;t meld well with the restaurant as a whole: the other sections consisted of an haute gastropub-like sushi bar and a bright atrium with a few tables (including the random one in the hallway) and a giant octopus painting.Tip: If you&#39;re like me and not well versed in know how to fully appreciate fancypants fish, I highly recommend the rolls. The nigiri selection has some seriously exquisite options, but personally I don&#39;t find it worthwhile to spend so much $$$ on a bite unless you&#39;re a connoisseur. The rolls, on the other hand, are mostly priced similarly to other sushi places, except the quality is superb. The caveat? It will be a challenge to go back to regular sushi. I never liked cheap sushi in the first place, but I think now I will be utterly disgusted. Akiko&#39;s redefines your concept of fish.

I said I would never come back after my previous experience, but I gave Akiko&#39;s a second chance, and I am very glad that I did. I learned from my first experience, and decided to do omakase at the bar this time. Skip everything else, and go straight for the fish, there&#39;s no point in wasting your stomach. Shit, the fish here is fresh AF. The highlights were:UniToroAnkimoEbiWagyu with truffle shavings = ultimate mouthgasm

Just ate here for dinner and spent over a hour enjoying my omakase meal :) I was not expecting such an authentic Japanese style place in downtown SF. I almost did not go in!!! I sat at the bar and had an awesome variety of nigiri and sashimi prepared for me. I tried things I have never tried before like barracuda, eel fish, hokkaido scallop, and more.I outlasted a couple that was already eating when I came in and another couple came in during my meal and I outlasted them as well. I just kept wanting to try more and was excited to see what else the chef would put together. My chef was a cute lil japanese guy who did not say much, but you could see the care he took in making each nigiri (you didn&#39;t even need soy sauce...just their VERY delish wasabi). My meal cost $116 (without tip and I had hot tea) and it was money well spent. I would come back here again for sure!!!I was told that 70% of the fish here is imported from Japan. They even import from Hawaii as well.

Being big fan of authentic Japanese food, we had high expectations for this restaurant given its Yelp reviews and reading from other news sources. However, I think it&#39;s a rip off.I found them sneaky with their pricing.First off, right after we sat down, the server came and asked &#34;Would you like some edamame and miso? Would you like me to bring you one of each?&#34; Usually, when someone offers you &#34;would you like XXX&#34; like &#34;would you like some bread?&#34;, it is assumed to be complementary service. And often times, edamame is complementary at Japanese restaurants. So that&#39;s what we assumed. However, we later found out this was not the case here, in fact they charged ~$15 for a bowl of edamame and &#34;miso&#34;. This is the first time I&#39;ve ever paid for edamame at a restaurant. The way the server posed the question was extremely misleading and never made us aware of the fact it was not complementary.We were also confused what exactly he meant by &#34;miso.&#34; That&#39;s the first time we heard someone offering &#34;miso&#34; as is. Turns out, the server meant miso SOUP. Here&#39;s a tip - &#34;miso&#34; means fermented bean paste. So I assumed you meant your edamame comes with some innovative miso paste for dipping. Miso SOUP is what you offered me - a diluted bow of water with barely any scallions. Don&#39;t try to be too hipster when it actually makes no sense. Please study up on your menu and language. Do you say &#34;Would you like some soy?&#34;Then the omakase - nothing spectacular and some of the fish was so cold and a bit hard. I knew right away it was frozen then defrosted. Apparently our reservation was too early (5:45) that they haven&#39;t fully finished defrosting?Finally the bill... Turns out their &#34;omakase&#34; isn&#39;t a real omakase but a &#34;Let the chief just pick some items from our existing menu and give to you suckers who can&#39;t order yourselves&#34;. Usually, the omakase menu comes at a particular fixed price and offer items not on the regular menu (that&#39;s the whole point of Omakase - to enjoy something off the menu). However, here every item on the omakase was charged SEPARATELY and it turns out, they just cherry picked a bunch of random items off their regular menu. Then what&#39;s the point of ordering omakase? We could&#39;ve just ordered off your menu and actually picked items we liked. That&#39;s NOT the purpose of omakase/chief&#39;s special!

Came in on Monday for an omakase lunch and ended up staying for almost 2 hours. Be sure to reserve a spot beforehand because it does get full and you might not be able to get a spot at the bar. I believe our sushi chefs name is Alex. Alex was really good at explaining to us what each fish was and where it came from. One thing I really appreciated was that he noticed I was left handed and was placing the sushi in an angle that was easy for me to pick up.Me and my friends had about 18-20 pieces. Some stand outs were the golden eye fish, the uni, cooked black cod and the A5 wagyu. On this particular day, they had 5 different unis. For one of the dishes, we had an uni tasting platter and then Alex combined all 5 unis together into one thing and served it. That made all the difference because we were able to taste all the individual flavors while they were together cause we were able to recognize the flavor profiles of each.They import a lot of fish from Japan as well as from around the country. The service was really good, everything was extremely clean.

OMG sushi heaven!!! Can I say Foodgasm?!?!Came here on our first night in San Fran straight from the airport. We wouldn&#39;t have made our 9pm reservation if we checked into our hotel first so we called and asked if we can bring our suitcases into the restaurant and they accommodated on short notice. When we got there, even with the four of us lugging our suitcases inside, they were still very welcoming. It&#39;s not a big place at all, but they still made space for us.We all got the omakase, which we were very excited for. They have such a huge variety of fish. We wanted to try everything! And yes everything they served us was so fresh. Couldn&#39;t have asked for a better place for our first night. We were impressed by every piece.For starters we were served spinach. Whoever thought spinach could taste so good? The dashi (soup) in the spinach went very well with the spinach. The sashimi platter came with sea bass, sea trout, katsuo, chu toro, hamachi, and shima aji. We also ate Hokkaido sea urchin, Hokkaido scallops, zuwaigani, mirugai, Ayu, Kohada, Saba, kamasu, aji, akamutsu, Nagasaki black tuna with Santa Barbara uni, wagyu, butterfish with Jidori shaved egg, and unprocessed Hokkaido Uni. I&#39;d have to say the UNPROCESSED Hokkaido Uni was my fave. It just melts in your mouth.By the time we were done eating, we wanted to eat it all over again. The service was excellent and by the end of the night we became friends with Allen, whom we assumed was the manager, so we asked if we can get a res for 3 nights later which was our last night in San Fran. And yes he came through! So again we ate there, on our last night, which made it an excellent way to end our vacay.We still got the omakase on our 2nd night, but asked to be served some different things from our first night.This time we were served octopus with cucumber to start, then for sashimi we had shima aji, black tuna, madai, scallops, and mirugai. And for the nigiri&#39;s: ankimo, Ayu, Arctic char, kamasu, unprocessed Hokkaido Uni, ebodai, New Zealand king salmon, akamutsu, black tuna, red snapper, golden eye snapper, Kohada, tuna belly, zuke maguro, ootoro with Uni, unagi, yellow tail belly, ikura, and wagyu. We did ask for couple of the same things from our first night that we thought were really good, but as you can see they have a huge variety.I will definitely be back without a doubt on my next trip to San Fran!

The food and service were absolutely exceptional, there&#39;s no doubt about that. We had the omakase and each dish was basically perfect.The only reason for a reduced star is the cost. I know I&#39;m fighting a losing battle here, but my objection to the spiraling cost of restaurants in SF continues. Two pieces of wagyu beef nigiri from the a la carte menu cost $25. That&#39;s $12.50 per piece.Don&#39;t get me wrong, it was perfect. If was amazing. But it feels almost immoral to pay that much money for what couldn&#39;t have been much more than 4 ounces of food (including the rice, which was also perfect).

Just had lunch here and cannot wait to come back sometime for dinner. Amazing food, fresh fresh fish, and incredible service.My friend and I walked in around 1:30pm on a Friday figuring they wouldn&#39;t be so busy. Not so - there were several reservations all the way up until 2pm. We had to wait about 5 minutes for a table to clear.Our waiter was very helpful in helping us pick what to eat. We decided to share the sashimi tasting and the get a few pieces of nigiri. Before the food comes out, the waiter brought out a small dish of fresh grated wasabi and pours soy sauce into a small dish for each person. Each dish is placed precisely on the table in a prescribed pattern.Sashimi - Good variety of fish. Every piece was fresh and melt in your mouth. Sashimi is presented with nasturtium in addition to the usual shiso and daikon. Our waiter recommended we dip the nasturtium in a bit of soy sauce as it&#39;s peppery and a bit like wasabi.Uni Nigiri - fresh, sweet, airy, and creamy on just a small ball of perfectly done sushi rice.Katsuo - lightly smoked, brushed with a bit of soy marinade, and topped with a bit of grated ginger. This fish just melted in our mouths with amazing flavor. Katsuo is one of those fish that can get that bad &#34;fishy&#34; taste, but there wasn&#39;t a hint of that here.Umimasu (Ocean Trout) - my favorite. buttery with a small sakura leaf to add complexity.There was a smoked sashimi dish at a couple of the tables around us that I&#39;d like to try next time.

Bold statement time. Akiko&#39;s is my favorite sushi restaurant in SF. Three of us were craving sushi and fortunately my wonderful man dates have frequented, and we happen to all work, in very close proximity to Akiko&#39;s. We came close to lunch hour closing so there was no wait. First thing I noticed was how cute the place is. It&#39;s tiny, narrow, and you would probably pass it a hundred times without noticing (those are my favorite kind of spots). Very clean and nice overall, props on the Aesop hand soap in the bathroom (but no mirror... weird).Feeling indecisive, we opted for omakase, but with a special instruction to keep bringing out more until we decided we were satiated. Three different kinds of uni, shrimp, tuna, salmon, more tuna, more uni later, we pumped the brakes. The fish was so fresh. I couldn&#39;t get enough. For as ham as we went, I was shocked the bill wasn&#39;t more - not cheap, but very reasonable IMO. I will definitely be back!

Having tried omakase in other restaurants, the omakase here is very underwhelming. I had high expectations after reading all the good reviews. Alas, we left disappointed. Without the a5 wagyu, I would&#39;ve given this place 1 star. The only other good thing is that they have fresh wasabi. Total for 2 omakase incl tax and tip is $292. Save your $ and try omakase elsewhere!

Really enjoyed our experience here. Definitely make a reservation. They are not large and we once made the mistake of trying to walk-in on a weeknight and they didn&#39;t have anything until late in the evening.The waiter was really friendly and willing to explain their menu and items. Given that their fish is rare and unique, we were not familiar with many of them. We took his advice to let the chef choose our options, letting him know any that we knew for sure we wanted to avoid. He recommended 7 pieces each of either sashimi or nigiri (depending on what the chef felt was best) at $5-10 a piece. We really loved the options we received:-Black tuna: soooo good. This was our favorite-Kanpachi-Rock fish-Trout: really buttery; looked like salmon-Halibut: this one was plainer than the others. Good texture but not our fave-Baby barracuda: the fishiest of them all-28 day aged blue fin tuna shoulder: so tenderAfter that though, we were definitely still hungry, so the waiter recommended the Ikiko (sp?) roll that is not on the menu. It had pretty standard ingredients: shrimp tempura, avo, seaweed wrap, rice, salmon, lemon. Even so, it was delicious!

Akiko&#39;s is my go to lunch spot when I want both superb Japanese food and to be able to have a conversation with the person sitting across from me. I especially enjoy the salmon teriyaki but I&#39;ve also liked the tonkatsu, udon and beef teriyaki (all of which come with miso soup and four pieces of nigiri or sashimi). Akiko&#39;s never disappoints!Though not cheap, I find Akiko&#39;s to be great value given the quality of the ingredients and care with which they are prepared.Reservations are a must at this tiny restaurant.

My Personal Sushi Constitution:Get there earlyWait for the barOmakase only - don&#39;t bother with anything else if you want the best fishLeave the restrictions at home, you&#39;ll miss out if you don&#39;tHave a conversation with the chef, I&#39;ve learned something new every timeDo not waste my time or calories on salmonChopsticks are not made for picking up sushi, your fingers areEverything in one bite onlyIt doesn&#39;t need soy sauceIf you still think the fish needs soy sauce, fine, but the rice doesn&#39;tGinger is your friend and makes the next bite tastierEast the ShisoYour eyes are bigger than your stomach - that rice expandsMake space for uni and tomago - these are the real testsThese rules only apply if I&#39;m in a rock solid legit sushi bar that knows what they&#39;re doing like Akiko&#39;s. The bar is cozy and the service is solid. A very respectable omakase that will run you ~ $100-125 pp if you are an oinker like me.

Went there with my aunt and uncle they both came here for vacation from Hong Kong. Both of them love Japanese food and travel there ever year. I wanted to take them to some place for some good sushi. And I travel here from Baltimore for vacation. Got there 5:15 waited for them to open. We were the 4th group waiting in line. The third couple told us they don&#39;t have reservation, and so did us. I thought we were there so early, maybe we could get a table. And no no no luck for us. Hostess told us everyone had reservations! I guessed those couple lie to us then...?She told us they are fully booked till next month. So I went online. Guess what I found! Openings! Openings!!! Openings?!?! What next month?! So the hostess was lying to us!!! Booked one for myself, since my uncle and aunt were can&#39;t go.Now I really want to see what they offer.Got there just on time. I got a bar seat since I&#39;m by myself. They said u have to request it ahead of time if u want bar seat.Service - 2 stars:I only saw a server once for water from start to finish. I guess no need to serve someone who doesn&#39;t order drink, right? Then come the awkward caucasian chef kept staring at me then kept looking away... Finally he asked do u have any question. I looked at him back asked should I order from him or just wait more. He said order from him is fine too. Two stars included the dishonest hostess...Food - 5 stars:I tried their Agedashi &#34;fried tofu with roe on top&#34; $9 (nicely done love it) and Sashimi tasting- 12 pc $34 (very fresh fishes)Wanted to order more, but with 88 + degrees outside. I better not over eat for my own good.Overall food is good but overpriced. I can get the same food at my local sushi place for much more reasonable price. Horrible service, which I can also get at my local place! Lol! No need to travel here to get that;)

I came at the dinner opening without a reservation and was able to be seated right away. I would recommend booking ahead though, they filled up fast and we were lucky to get a table.For dinner we ordered the tamago, spider, tekka and negihama rolls. The fish was very fresh! Very delicious. We also got the ika - which was fried squid. It was incredible, crunchy without being overly greasy. They have mochi available for dessert, and we tried the black sesame. It was perfect, not too sweet and great texture. Overall was a very pleasant dinner!

Was looking to get some sushi for dinner and spotted the restaurant near my hotel, ordered the omakase and I was impressed by one of the best value for money sushi meals. You normally only find this kind of quality in places that cost twice the price. Loved the no frills sushi bar and relaxed atmosphere too.

Okay. Not really sure where to start with this. I came here for lunch a few months ago and it was a total 5 star experience for me -- felt like I was mindblown by how high quality the food was and how delicious it was. But I came here last night for the omakase and was severely underwhelmed by how mediocre the entire omakase experience was. Unfortunately, I&#39;m writing this review post that recent experience so my review will be a little less than desirable, but eh. What happens happens.Akiko&#39;s is a reservation only restaurant -- all you do is email the restaurant to make a reservation. It&#39;s not particularly hard to get them e.g. I&#39;ve always emailed a few days in advance and had no problems. The crowd is definitely FiDi business people lunch eating kind of atmosphere, so it&#39;s classy etc.The lunch set I had was quite simple -- some rice and some sashimi pieces. I&#39;ve uploaded photos for my dinner --there were quite a variety of things -- scallops, black cod, mackeral, salmon, yellowtail, lean tuna, etc. Interesting mix of sashimi and some other raw fish with some nigiri pieces. Overall... it just wasn&#39;t an amazing experience. The sushi was okay, but I was pretty intrigued by the rice since it looked like brown rice but didn&#39;t have the texture of it? I was confused. I also found it really weird that for an omakase they didn&#39;t give us our own place. For one dish, we were served one cooked black cod which is fine because I was with a friend, but what if we were coworkers? That would have been a bit awkward and strange if we had to split the fish with our chopsticks and share off of it.Another odd thing -- they made a specific deal about asking us about what we didn&#39;t like. My friend said she didn&#39;t like cilantro. Then the first dish they served us ... had cilantro. Like why?? What was the point of asking if you weren&#39;t going to honor it? Or did you already forget? Unclear.Anyways, each fish was above average I guess... but the final omakase was $125 after tax and tip. You can get a Jiro&#39;s apprentice omakase for $125 in NYC ... I&#39;d much rather eat that than eat here. Fish was generally fresh and good, but I just wish there was more nigiri since I left pretty hungry but didn&#39;t feel like adding more to the baseline omakase since I knew it was going to be $$$$. In retrospect, we should have just customized our omakase and ordered fish on our own rather than letting the chef choose.tldr; lunch is better than dinner, imho. it&#39;s cheaper too. make sure to email in for reservations cause you&#39;re unlikely to get in by walking

We made a reservation on the only available time which was 9pm. Arriving at 9 we had to wait a little and then were seated. After 45minutes were told that they were closing and getting the last orders.You shouldnt give reservation time for 9pm if you are not a fast food restaurant.Also my ten year old son was sitting and playing on my phone with no sound when one of the waiters came and told us to mute the sound. Sitting next to him there was no sound.The waiter serving us was nice, but the other one wouldnt even look at us while leaving. They were all also very busy serving one couple not sure what was so special about them.Well the food was ok but not good enough to be treated like that.Won&#39;t go back.

I&#39;ve been here twice now (though I didn&#39;t realize I was going to the same place the second time I went til I actually sat down). I&#39;ll make this short and sweet:-Make reservations. The place is small, and the place is packed for lunch and dinner alike.-Service is so-so. Other staff comes and checks on you more than the waiter, which is odd, but I guess it works.-You can&#39;t have a group of more than 4, so if you have a big group, go somewhere else-Get the sashimi or nigiri. The salmon and tuna were sublime. I wish I had tried more than just a few sashimi types, but that&#39;s life.-The rolls SUCK. I&#39;m aware &#39;true sushi&#39; isn&#39;t rolls, but why bother having them on the menu if they&#39;re not good? 5 pieces per roll as well, so they&#39;re small.All in all, come here for the sashimi/nigiri, but you pay for what you get.

My new crush: Akiko&#39;s!!!I&#39;ve been here twice: once as a walk in with one other person (a la carte) and the second time with a group reservation for omakase (the max is 4 per party and is recommended that you rsvp in advance).And oh my gashe (see what I did there?)! Both times the food was delightful. I especially recommend the deep sea red grouper, sea trout, uni, and... well, basically everything!My friend and I each had about 11 pieces of nigiri and paid ~$60 plus sake. We were both pretty satisfied. Not hungry until later into the night when we got some golden boy from North Beach. My friend and I were lucky in that we came in on a Saturday at 8pm and the guy was able to seat us in 15 minutes. Apparently, this is atypical.Omakase was $130/person (pictures are on their way up here). I would say my only disappointment (other than the fact that I will never have an endless river of sushi flow before my eyes and into my mouth -- this will only happen in my dreams), is that usually I enjoy hearing what everything actually is; we had a hodgepodge of wait people, and several of them mumbled or didn&#39;t even explain. Super sad face. But all is forgiven in light of the quality fish meats!Fidi, so parking is rough, but if you take bart BART, Akiko&#39;s is definitely walkable. Also... omakase well get you ice cream mochi for dessert!

I was in San Francisco for business when I stumbled upon Akiko&#39;s. I sat at closing time at the sushi counter and ordered many things. I also came back the very next day at opening time and sat at the sushi counter as well.First off I will start by saying that I don&#39;t think this restaurant is only two $$ in price. It&#39;s definitely more expensive. For just a party of 1 (me) my bill was $100+ on the first night. Yes, this was partly due to the fact that I didn&#39;t realize the kinmedai sushi was $20 for two pieces and I ordered 4 pieces (whoops). Even though it&#39;s outrageous to pay $40 for 4 pieces of sushi, kinmedai is my favorite, so my bad.Secondly, I have to mention how hard I laughed at the crowd that dines at this place. They are the white people crowd that think they are sushi experts AKA they had a California roll one time 4 years ago. When I hear someone ordering rolls with pride, my blood boils. I shrink in my seat and whisper when I order rolls. I swear to you this woman came in, made a big deal about sitting at the sushi counter and then said &#34;I&#39;ll do the omakase - chefs choice and let him choose my sushi&#34;. Then she said &#34;btw I don&#39;t eat&#34; and listed 400 things). She also then said how she definitely knows he can make her a good roll. Uhhhh. Omakase sushi at the counter DOESN&#39;T EQUAL ROLLS. It equals a piece of raw fish sitting on top of rice, period. I laughed so hard I almost damn near fell off my chair.I ordered:+ Uni (just the uni over rice). He put this soy sauce glaze on the top and it literally melted in my mouth. It was one of the best pieces of uni I ever had in my life (now that says a lot).- Octopus sunomono - I&#39;d pass on this. The scallop one was much better.+ Scallop sunomono - MUST. ORDER. Wowzers+ Tekka roll+ Kinmedai sushi - They torch it and honestly this is soooooooo goodI can&#39;t remember what else I ordered. I will definitely be back!

One of my favorite sushi restaurants in town. Difficult to get a table without a reservation, and even harder to find (they dont have their name displayed outside). Great for a date night or small groups (4 max) as the restaurant is small itself.Everything is fresh and very delicious!

I&#39;ve been debating this for a while.The sushi was fantastic, there is no doubt about that. I&#39;m still a novice in the non-lunch special sushi offerings, but there wasn&#39;t a bite that wasn&#39;t out of this world to me. I went with the Omakase, and really that is where my issues began. Omakase isn&#39;t cheap, and as such I was hoping to not only get great food but also great service. For whatever reason, the sushi chef just didn&#39;t seem to want any part of dealing with me. His explanations were short and any followup questions lead to answers with attitude. I take fault with perhaps not being as vocal about wanting more knowledge as a Omakase neophyte, but I just never felt welcome at the counter. I&#39;ve been fortunate to have experienced Omakase in NYC and also Washington D.C. and in each of those experiences the sushi chefs went out of their way to make a newb like me feel welcome.

Four stars for the food but three stars for how outrageously overpriced it was. We love sushi and have been to many sushi spots. We also do not mind spending money on great food and truly appreciate food experiences.We came here with high expectations and while the food was good, it wasn&#39;t amazing and certainly not worth the $350 we spent on two omakases (8-10). It is true that you&#39;ll find different types of fish here and that&#39;s wonderful but the experience itself was not worth the high price tag and I am 100% positive I can eat the same quality of fish with a better experience for much less.

Good omakase, but puts a dent in your wallet.Akiko&#39;s is a small but nicely decorated sushi spot in Union Square. I highly recommend making a reservation. I noticed everyone who came as a walk in was told they&#39;re unable to take them and need to make a reservation for another day. I tried making a reservation online but there wasn&#39;t anything for the day I wanted. I emailed them and asked if I can get a reservation that day and they were able to squeeze me in. Send them an email if you want to eat on a particular day. Request a seat at the sushi bar so you can chat it up with the sushi chef.The one thing I noticed about Akiko&#39;s omakase was the slice of each fish. It was extremely small compared to other omakase experiences. The omakase was delicious and I enjoyed what the chef selected for us. However, pretty sad that I spent twice as much considering the portion of each fish. I don&#39;t plan on coming here again because it&#39;s expensive. I think the price point should be updated on its Yelp page.

Akiko&#39;s offers simple, high quality Japanese food. And don&#39;t be fooled...while the prices don&#39;t look bad on the menu, the portions are very petite! If you&#39;re an AYCE sushi type of person this ain&#39;t the place for you.My 4 stars all go to the quality of the food, everything else was pretty average.Tip: the restaurant is a little hard to find because it&#39;s tiny and there is no sign outside! Once you see The Irish Bank, the door to the left will be the magical gateway to Akiko&#39;s.

Either make a reservation or go there after rush hour. I went to Akiko&#39;s on a Saturday night around 8.30pm with no reservation and there were a lot of tables available.I&#39;m not really happy with my experience at Akiko&#39;s. The menu wasn&#39;t rich of choices and extremely hard to understand. I ordered a nigiri dish and a roll, which would usually completely fill me up in whatever other sushi place, but the portions were ridiculously small. Besides that, EVERYTHING WAS SPICY. I was very disappointed on this because I can&#39;t stand spicy food and I always make sure that what I&#39;m ordering is not even slightly spicy. The menu wasn&#39;t clear about it at all and everything my friend and I ordered was so spicy that we could barely eat it.Everything was also overpriced and I really don&#39;t think the food was worth the money.To be honest, the only reason why I&#39;m giving this restaurant more than one star is the service, which was just impeccable.

What a unexpected lovely dining experience I had at Akiko&#39;s. A friend and I were just doing a casual stroll in Chinatown, got hungry, was craving sushi, and stumbled on this cute little restaurant. We arrived right at 2pm without a reservation and was seated immediately at a window seat. The place itself is a well kept and has a modern hip woody-aesthetic.We decided to go with the $20-30 lunch pre-fixed sashimi + main entree meals. Each of the dishes came with a 6 piece sashimi appetizer followed by a main dish of your choosing. So right to the food - the sashimi was out of this world, very fresh and just melted like butter in my mouth. As for the main course I had the tonkatsu was crisp and delicious but not the best I&#39;ve had. My friend had the Saba Shio-Yaki which is grilled mackerel which he seemed to enjoy a lot. The service was timely and water was filled regularly, but not exceptional service.Overall, Akiko&#39;s was a pleasant restaurant to visit during lunch, I would come back for dinner but am not in the area. Maybe next time!

Absolutely my favorite sushi place in the bay area so far. I would recommend sitting at the sushi bar to get the best experience. The staff here are so friendly and knowledgeable about sushi and crafting amazing sushi. You can truly taste the freshness and uniqueness of the sushi/nigiri here if you order the omakase. Every bite is happiness.

I&#39;ve been fortunate that I have met people that enjoy food as much as I do. It&#39;s been a treat eating here too. To that person, thank you. We had the omakase. We had about 10 dishes that were nigiri with salmon, other fish, crab, and uni. We also had some small plates too. I loved it! I think the other person enjoyed it too! At least, that&#39;s what I thought! You would need to make a reservation and be on time! They are always full of people.

I LOVE the interior of Akiko&#39;s - it&#39;s very unassuming from the street (you would miss it, if you don&#39;t know it&#39;s there), but once you walk in the charming exposed brick and cozy tables are very welcoming.As far as the food goes, I left happy but not wowed. I thought the black tuna was fresh but overpriced, the agedashi tofu I would not order again (not enough flavor, the texture was a bit off), but I did REALLY like the uni special roll we got. That was probably the best uni I&#39;ve ever had. The &#39;hara sake&#39; (seared salmon belly) was also very good.Other rolls fell somewhere in the middle - good (we finished them!), but not super memorable.They do have a nice variety of sake, and their service is extremely attentive and on-point.

Sushi is so important to LIFE and great sushi means EVERYTHING!Akiko&#39;s is definitely on top of my list as one of the best sushi restaurants in the bay area. You HAVE to make reservations in order to get seated but as long as you call a week in advance, you&#39;re guaranteed to get a table.I highly recommend getting chef choice - omakase to get the freshest and best quality sushi of the day. It&#39;s definitely not cheap, you are looking at around $180 per person with drinks and tax.I&#39;ll definitely be back!

Perfect place for lunch :) we went and sat a bar, which had a really cool environment, and got their lunch special. The fish was fresh and almost slightly sweet, the rice was perfectly seasoned with vinegar/salt/sugar and good temperature, and the tempura was also good, too. I would definitely recommend!

I will admit I just stopped in there because I had been on a long walk and needed some motivation!It is a bit tricky to find with the Yelp map - which cant QUITE place it - but if you open your eyes and rejoin the actual world... there it is.Once you are inside you find relaxing oasis in the no-mans land between china town and the lonely financial zone by the sea...The fish was well portioned and very very smooth and flavorful.I drank some tea... ate some sashimi... and ventured on - I would stop by again if my wanders so permitted.Still on the fence whether I would try omakase here...

Came across this spot while wandering through SF many months ago and found it around lunch time. Wandered in to be asked if we had a reservation, the answer to which was presumably quite obvious due to our casual attire and touristy exhausted looks. Of course we did not have one - so the host looked through his computer and found someone that was very late for theirs, so, voila, we have a table. Absolutely sensational experience. I crushed a ton of food, but also asked the waitress what she would recommend most and she provided a black cod dish that was to die for. Probably one of the best single plates I&#39;ve ever had if memory serves. Wine list was on point as well. Tried again on a different day and no such luck. Definitely worth a stop if the space is available.One quick edit - I didn&#39;t read the other reviews first, and now notice a lot of people mentioning price. My share was well over $100 for lunch and I do not regret a single penny. But yes, I ate a lot and we also had wine :)

I had the chefs choice for lunch. He created an 11-piece set for me. What I love about akiko is the diverse set of tastes and texture relative to other sushi places. Their house made soy sauce is stellar. I thought their rice worked well with certain types of fish but not for others.Try their kinki - lightly toasted monk fish river and red snapper. The best piece I had at Akiko ($10 a piece)!

I can&#39;t say enough wonderful words about this inconspicuous sushi restaurant in the middle of Union Square. When you walk in, the sushi bar with the high stools are very inviting, allowing you to watch the sushi masters work their magic. The owners are always watching carefully, making sure the customers are happy with their selections. The fish is so fresh... Yellowtail, salmon, uni, and my fave...the toro. All melt in your mouth.If you&#39;re looking to take that special someone on a date, come by yourself and grab a few rolls or for a business meeting, this place is good for all. I will definitely be back!!!

Firstly, right through the door, we&#39;re told our party of 5 cannot be accommodated as the restaurant has a max 4 ppl per party maximum. The restaurant is half empty. The hostess then proceeds to suggest we try a different sushi restaurant about a 10min walk away. In the rain. Do they really not want our money that badly?Thanks to high school math we suggest:&#34;How about we sit 3 on one table and 2 on another table?&#34;Our robot of a hostess pauses to think if this violates the prime directive...&#34;Yes ok that is possible but you won&#39;t be seated close to each other.&#34;&#34;Er... Ok but how about that table for 4 next to an empty table of 2 over there?&#34;The seater refuses and says that particular table for two (near the back by the bathroom) is reserved so two of us will have to sit a couple tables down. At an identical table for two. At this point things were getting silly and if it wasn&#39;t still pouring down outside we would have left but we took our seats, in different parts of the restaurant.Eventually after promising that we&#39;ll pay on two separate checks, we were allowed to sit next to one another. But had to order separately and weren&#39;t allowed to share dishes...The rest of this dining experience was not much better. The service was ok. The sushi was slightly better. Fish was fresh but the rice was on the cold/firm side. Miso was also available and was good. However the price was definitely not worth it. You can find better for a lot less.The one star is for the decor. That&#39;s the only thing this place has going for it. It&#39;s all lovely wood. Even down to the bowls and chopsticks. Handy as this place needs to be burnt to the ground to make room for a better restaurant.FTP.

Made a reservation for 8:45pm Friday night for 3 people. We were seated promptly. Even though the official closing time is 9:00pm the restaurant was still packed and when we left at 10 there were still a few parties staying there.#Soft Shell Crab: B+.If anything I would say it was not crispy enough. But overall I could still feel the crab meat structure and taste.#Amaebi Nigiri: B+.It was quite fresh. But again the fried shrimp head was not crispy enough.#Sashimi Tasting: B.We all got one order each, and before we ordered we were really struggling to decide between this and omakase. All of us really regretted it though - the fish selection was very ordinary (albacore tuna, big eye tuna, sea bass, king salmon, yellowtail). The freshness was okay but it&#39;s on the same level as any ordinary Japanese joints in the Bay Area. And it&#39;s $34 not cheap at all. Not sure if the omakase would be any better though.Overall, I think I would only go back for an omakase experience and see if it justifies for an additional star. Not very impressed with the rest of the menu though.

Came here for yet again a business lunch. Easy to miss as it looks like an Irish pub or just a regular eatery, not like your typical Japanese restaurant, whatever that means to you.We got seated right away - I had a reservation - and ordered nigiri a la cart. The quality of the sushi is super high. I had the smoothest ankimo I&#39;ve ever had since living in Japan 20 years ago. Unbelievable. Everything was top notch.Service was good, the waitstaff attentive and while he was making recommendations from off the list items, he let us know most of those orders ranged between $6 and $12 per order and recommended 7-9 pieces.Of course it&#39;s expensive! Top notch sushi in FiDi, duh! But. Worth it. I will be back.

Came here for dinner the other night, around 6. Turns out they did not have half the items on their menu and would suggest a substitute. You would imagine the suggestions would be at least comparable to the nigiri you ordered but...nope. Quality was good. Service was not great, pretty slow. May I suggest a daily, or at least weekly printed menu? Would make it 10x easier to order and know what you&#39;re ordering.

Akiko&#39;s has been on my list for quite some time. I definitely thought it was excellent - from going a la carte or doing the omakase - everything here is optimal.I decided to go with the Omakase and told them up front that my budget was $60. Definitely on the pricier side since I only got 8 pieces + 1 spoonful of Russian Uni. I later looked at the receipt and noted that the Toro and Uni were $11 a piece.Regardless, the nigiri here is absolutely delicious - from the perfectly crafted sushi-rice to the perfectly-sized topped pieces of fish.Service is excellent and fast. There&#39;s a bar that seats about 8-12 people, two or three small tables at the front, and about 7 more tables in the interior dining room. Go for a special treat!

Wait, how have I not left a review for my favorite sushi spot of all time, this is slightly ridiculous. Every time I want to indulge and have the best sushi god created I come here. Omakase. Hands down. All day. Every day. If it was just me I&#39;d probably eat up the bill until it reaches $500 because their Omakase is charged per piece/eat until you&#39;re full-style. The chefs are really friendly and they cater to what you want to try as well. I love you Akikos. T_T

Came here at 5:30pm on a Friday for a party of 2 without a reservation and SUPER LUCKY we didn&#39;t have to wait! The hostess just said they would need the table back before 7pm (which was plenty of time to eat).We ordered:Hara Sake (seared salmon belly)Kuro Maguro (black tuna)Sake (king salmon)Uni (sea urchin)Negi Toro (tuna belly roll)[&amp; one more nigiri that I can&#39;t remmeber...]My top 2 favorites were the Hara Sake and Uni. The salmon belly literally melted in my mouth and I felt like I was floating the sky doing cartwheels. The uni was so fresh, nice and creamy that I didn&#39;t want to drink water or eat anything else so that taste can stay in my mouth forever.There are actually different types of uni so make sure to ask your server! *kudos to them too because they are super helpful and patient in explaining the different types too. At the end, I just told the server to decide for us because we couldn&#39;t choose on our own haha.The serving size is definitely a little smaller than what you may be used to in other Japanese restaurants but the quality is definitely top notch. Besides, remember this restaurant is in SF and literally by Union Square. It explains the $$ but I thought it was pretty worth.

Undoubtedly our favorite place to eat in all of California. Honestly - it&#39;s my wife&#39;s favorite restaurant in the US. We always sit with Allen. He&#39;s a great waiter. We don&#39;t even order. We just tell Allen to bring us whatever. We want to try everything. Allen puts together an amazing sushi meal for us and just keeps the food and drinks coming. 2.5 hours later - we&#39;re stuffed and walking back to the hotel with one of the most amazing dinner experiences one could possibly have hoped for. I could recommend this place more highly. We brought friends from Chicago this time to share in the experience. This place is a must. Ask for Allen.

3 months for one lunch reservation? What is this? The Japanese French Laundry?The fish was decent, but at these upscale prices, it wasn&#39;t enough to wow me.For the prices they charge, ALL the fish hold be flown from Japan, and have that fresh buttery taste, which it did not.The waiter was slow with the tea and the dishes, and when I ordered the unagi roll, it wasn&#39;t even warm, or at room temperature, but tasted like it had been sitting at the sushi bar waiting to be served to the first sucker.And that sucker would be me.My co-worker had the chicken bento which was excellent, but once again, at double the price, that&#39;s the least of my expectations.The toro roll had more rice than anything, which I&#39;m never a fan of.The uni was good, and the salmon and hamachi nigiri were okay.And with lunch coming out to around $80, is it really worth it?Honestly, with so many great Japanese restaurants out there, I don&#39;t see Akiko&#39;s as being in one of my top 10 restaurants.

In my opinion, they put too much wasabi on the sushi. They are too strong!! I ordered the omakase. My first time here so maybe the chef&#39;s is a bit off today.I don&#39;t recommend this place if you want to eat sushi, I think you can go with the sashimi instead. Not to mention the price, it won&#39;t be worth it.

Came here for my 5th anniversary and loved it. I highly recommend the omakase by Alex. He made so many beautifully creative nigiri it was very difficult to say which pieces we liked best. Of course good sushi places will have fresh fish -- that&#39;s a given. But what sets this place apart is the creativity and the chef&#39;s ability to build such beautifully complex and multidimensional flavors. If you&#39;re open and looking for something different, truly leave it up to the chef. You will experience so much more that way. We left everything up to the chef and we&#39;re glad that we did. Thank you again Alex, for making our anniversary dinner amazing!

This place is great, sushi is fresh and a good selection of sushi. The hamachi Kama was a bit salty but other that everything is pretty good.I am in sf for 3 nights and spent 2 nights going to Akiko for dinner. Last night the food was great, a four star but the sushi chef is terrible. I did Omakase and He didn&#39;t even tell me what I am eating and didn&#39;t even want to ask me anything. I have over 20 pieces and it was around $140. I ate so many pieces but didn&#39;t know what kind of fish to reorder. Next time I will look another place. 4 star for sushi but 1 star for service.

I&#39;m just going to say it...100% the best sushi I have ever had in the city. EVER.Let&#39;s get it straight here, you are not coming to Akiko&#39;s to order rolls and chicken udon (oops, sorry...my inner snootiness is showing). I&#39;m sure they keep these things on the menu to appease the general public but if you&#39;re going to shell out $$$$ prices you at least should know why you&#39;re paying the big bucks. You are paying for amazing quality fish and unforgettable nigiri. Yes, it&#39;s only one bite, but it&#39;s one bite you&#39;ll be thinking about for days to come.Our group of 4 was initially not planning on getting the omakase but the menu was a little difficult to navigate so we ended up opting for the omakase due to our insufficient sushi IQ. It was nice to just let the sushi chef do the thinking for us and sit back, relax and let the food magically appear on the table. BUT, lucky for you, I took diligent notes throughout the meal and now you can get the highlight of the omakase for 70% of the cost (yes, I did the math). Our omakase cost $120 (it depends on what/how many dishes they bring out) and you can have the greatest hits for roughly $80! Yes, you are very welcome!I&#39;ve thought this out a lot...here are the must haves in ranking order:1. Ji-kinmedai (cold smoked golden eye snapper): I have never had or heard of this before but the cold smoke mild flavor paired with the mild fattiness of the fish...ridiculous.2. Otoro (fatty tuna): This one I did not see on the menu but it was heavenly...texture and flavor spot on3. Giant clam: Another one that was not on the menu but the texture had some bite on it and it had a mild sweet flavor4. Nama hotate (over-nighted fresh scallop): Crisp, fresh scallop at it&#39;s best5. Ensui uni (sea urchin): This was not your usual sea urchin, it was unprocessed and served on a spoon with rice. Sweeter flavor and less fishiness than your usual sea urchin.5. Sanma (pike mackeral): A little more of that fishy flavor but still smooth and not off-putting6. Managatsuo (silver pomfet butterfish): It has a light sear on it but even the raw parts have that smooth buttery flavor7. Salt water eel: Another one off menu, didn&#39;t have as much of that cloyingly sweet sauce so you could actually taste the subtle flavor of the eel. Different texture from fresh water eel.8. Kuro Maguro (black tuna): Really nice texture as far as tunas go. I&#39;m less of a fan of tuna but this is definitely one of the best ones I&#39;ve had.9. Kanpachi (amberjack): Good but less unique than everything else, it&#39;s all relative.Extra not nigiri orders:1. Hamachi kama was good and at only $15 it&#39;s a good way to fill up the belly a bit2. A5 Wagyu with truffle: This was a nice way to close out the meal but it has really strong flavors and textures. For the omakase it was $50 for 4, I would get it once for the experience but probably not again.Other throwaways on the omakase was an agedashi tofu and a salad with octopus on it that are not really worth having.Well, there you go! Consider yourself a professional nigiri orderer now although, I&#39;ll be honest, I mainly wrote this review for my own use so when I go again I can easy navigate the menu. Have fun!

I came here with my girlfriend for her birthday and I was thoroughly impressed with both food and service. The best sushi I&#39;ve had in the city is Kusakabe - which recently received a Michilin star actually, and while Akiko&#39;s did not exceed Kusakabe, it was nonetheless *very* good.Between the two of us, we ordered two rolls, the sashimi sampler, about 8 pieces of nigiri, and two plates from the kitchen and we were stuffed.- The agedashi tofu here is delicious and I would highly recommend it. The broth that it&#39;s served in is very light, has great flavor, and isn&#39;t too salty. The dish is served with roe, so if you&#39;re not a fan of it, you may want to pass.- Tuna here is great! We tried a few different cuts and each one tasted very fresh. The only nigiri that I wasn&#39;t impressed by was the scallops. Scallops were not as sweet as I would&#39;ve liked them to be. Maybe next time.- King crab roll/friend crab: you must order one of these. Fried to perfection, and every bite will leave you wanting more.Akiko&#39;s does not break the bank so don&#39;t feel like you have to come here only to celebrate a special occasion. Get a reservation for sure, since you might be turned away otherwise.

Writing this review after my second visit to Akiko&#39;s. My first time I sat at a table in the back and had an assortment of nigiri and the second time I sat at the sushi bar in front of Chef Alex. These two experiences were very different, and my second time here doing omakase at the sushi bar is what drives this 5-star review.The nigiri that Chef Alex prepared was absolutely delicious and included hotate, mirugai, madai, otoro, kani, hamachi, kanpachi, uni, ika, aji, and anago, to name a few. I think overall we had ~23 pieces of nigiri. The sushi I had here wasn&#39;t the very traditional kind you&#39;ll find in Japan, or at certain other restaurants here in the city (Maruya, for example, is more on the traditional side in my opinion). The chef used a variety of ingredients to mix things up and add his own interpretation of the nigiri, all of which were received very well. Some pieces were very flavorful and others simply melted in your mouth. The rice was also good too - not sticky, good texture on the individual grains.Overall a great time at Akiko&#39;s and just the omakase itself that night was ~$165. They also have some great sake too, but of course that will easily bump you up into the $250+ per person range.

I brought my Japanese mother here for lunch. She ordered the moriwase which was 6 pieces of sushi. She ate 2 pieces and said it didn&#39;t taste good. I ordered the sashimi and tempura lunch but was served sushi and tempura.The quality of the fish is excellent. The proportion of rice to fish was correct ( able to eat it in one bite). The rice under some fish was brown which horrified my purist mother. The texture of the rice was good.The tempura was tasteless under a heavy batter. The pieces were all HUGE and generally unidentifiable. The pieces at the bottom of the stack were soggy. I could see the blotting paper was saturated with oil.Service was ok but generally lackluster. Come for the fish but stay away if you&#39;re a purist. The food was disappointing.

What really stands out from all the other similar Nigiri/omakase Japanese restaurants in the city was their &#34;A5 Wagyu&#34; the taste was amazing, the cuts was thick enough to taste it&#39;s A5 grades.We ordered nigiri from the a la carte, they go by 2pc per order. price for the quality are worth it. I didn&#39;t get since they use expensive red sushi rice vinegar why does their rice for sushi was on the low quality side?Hamachi kama was extremely tender...A+Gindara, it didn&#39;t cooked well or marinated well, but the miso aka su reduction sauce was tasty CBut over all, the experience was professional &amp; attentive.

Why do I always leave piss drunk after leaving this establishment? I have had some of the most memorable dinners at this place. Dined here 10+ times and each time totally killed my wallet. The sushi chefs just keep going and going then you get your surprise bill at the end. There are a few omakase pieces that I dislike but everything else is superb. The wagyu is heavenly and absolutely melts in your mouth. Totally worth it and this place is one of my top 3!

I already wrote a review on Yelp about this place, but today&#39;s experience just took Akiko&#39;s to the next level. Felix greeted us at the front and set the stage for a delightful sushi performance. I would greatly recommend sitting at the bar. (As I have only sat at tables before).Steve was our chef and was a total delight! We put our hunger in his hands and he provided a delightful spread of sashimi and explained each piece. The total experience was perfect. We will be back...and maybe when they re-open for dinner.

The freshest sushi-grade fish in San Francisco. We had the omakase. Some of the sashimi was flown here from Japan. Every fish we tried was deliciously mouthwatering, but I think my favorite was the crab in buttered miso.

I tried Omakase tonight! It was so great and delicious! Most impressive is uni from different places, Hokkaido, Russia, and California. Actually I prefer hokkaido&#39;s uni which is the best!!! Also I love their A5 level beef sushi! After the experience in wako, I think Akiko&#39;s did a fantastic job too! And the server is excellent! He gave us many advices, which is really helpful! About price, I think for their freshest and finest food material, the price is good too! Overall, it must be a impressive sushi night! I will definitely go back for more different seasonal sushi!

Yes, I was a fan of the FOOD but there were some things that made me NOT love this place. It&#39;s a shame because Akiko&#39;s could really be great. I was impressed with their quality of rice, a lot of places get that wrong and it is an integral park of nigri.All the fish was fresh and tasty, they had a nice selection of just in special seafood which I enjoyed. Small place and I sat at the sushi bar. No complaints about food and thought it was very good sushi. Also, I do think you could get out of there without spending a fortune if you watch what you order.That said there were quite a few things I noticed at the bar that made this sushi spot seem not of the highest caliber. At any truly good sushi restaurant sitting at the bar is an interactive experience and you can really watch the chefs work their magic. I did watch and saw what I felt were negatives:-I could NOT get over that one of the chefs doing sashimi had what looked like dirty finger nails. I can&#39;t imagine he did .. how in hell could a decent sushi place have a guy with dirty nails working????? I looked at the other chefs.. their nails were totally clean. Could it have been from the fish? I just don&#39;t see how the fresh fish could have made the outlines and underneath his nails black. I just could not get over this.. three carafes of sake later I did get over it but I just can&#39;t understand. It was SO BIZARRE I wanted to say something but didn&#39;t see any GM around.-Sushi chef with dirty ass nails also had old rubber bands around his wrist.. I felt they shouldnt have any jewelry on (aside from a wedding wring) when handling raw fish.-Sushi chefs were swigging from snapple bottles. Why not put it in a glass and keep it at a certain class level?Overall from sitting at the sushi bar if the chefs could tighten up their visual and performance game to have a true high end experience it be a lot better.

Came here for a New Year&#39;s Eve dinner after hearing all of the rave reviews, and boy, did it live up to its reputation.***One disclaimer ***This isn&#39;t a sushi restaurant for those who like deep fried California rolls covered in sauce and cream cheese. If your one of those people, please do us a favor and save your time, money and the space you would consume to make room for the rest of us, and go to sushi boat.This is a small restaurant with high quality fish, expert sushi chefs with top notch knife skills where each piece of sashimi melts in your mouth with the cleanest of flavors. I would recommend the yellow tail, tuna belly, sake salmon as tried and true options. Also, try the black sesame ice cream for dessert - amazing!Overall, this is one of the best sushi spots in a city known for great food. Highly recommend and will definitely be returning.

Whoooooo-weeeee. I love akikos. The food is soooooooo damn good. I made reservations like a month ahead of time and it&#39;s sooooo worth it. When I got there they tried to seat as the very corner near the entrance and it was a horrible spot, so I was like nuh uh. This is a no go. So we waited another 15-20 minutes to get a seat inside the restaurant and it so worth it. Btw if you&#39;re all about the experience you should request a bar seat. I think watching people make my sushi is quite an experience. Anyways we got seated and ordered the omakase. I highly recommend anyone going to akikos for the first time to order omakase. It&#39;s basically the chefs choice and its damn near 12 plates of perfection. Every dish was at the very least a 8/10 dish. I&#39;ll be honest going through the whole Omakase did not get me all the way full though so be prepared to order a few more dishes or eat a bigger lunch. Overall the meal was about $380+ for two but it was sooooo worth it. Highly recommended.

Yay! Awesome sushi! This place is full every time I walk past so I was super happy that I managed to make a reservation on Open Table for lunch just 20 min in advance.I had the 4 piece nigiri sushi sampler with saba shio-yaki. The sushi was amazing and the fish extremely fresh. Definitely wish I had more!The saba shio-yaki took forever to be served after we were done with the sushi. My friend had already finished with her 6pcs nigiri tasting selection AND 2 cups of miso soup before my fish was served.The fish itself was seasoned perfectly, though I found it to be just slightly overcooked so the fish dried out. Definitely coming back again another time for the omakase!

I&#39;m going to chalk this up as, I didn&#39;t come here for dinner, I didn&#39;t come with the right people, I didn&#39;t sit at the bar, and I didn&#39;t have as good of a time.I actually know plenty of people who love this place, everyone on the side bar of my review as I am looking have given it between 4 - 5 stars ... yet I was a little disappointed. I came here last year for lunch after a whirlwind week at I/O. It wasn&#39;t too hard to get into, and the restaurant was nice, ambiance was good, and the service was friendly.I got some nigiri dishes because I wanted to try their nigiri, but in the end it was adequate at best. Nothing was super fresh, very tasty or even memorable. I do want to come back especially since the chef posts up so many awesome things on IG and I literally drool when I see their fresh fish deliveries, but for now this place is a 3-star for me.

Like other reviewers before me, Akiko&#39;s is some of the best sushi I have ever had.Be warned though that this is a lot pricier than reported and definitely a treat to go to. Sat at the sushi bar and the chef, Chris, is fantastic. We were having trouble deciding so he just starting feeding us! He was sensitive about my shellfish allergy and checked in with us to make sure the tasting timing was comfortable. The server, knowing chef was taking care of us, gave a good amount of space.Days later, i was still thinking about the deliciousness of the fish. The sushi was sub par, very fresh and melt in your mouth fantastic.We didn&#39;t have a reservation and the wait was about an hour....we went to the Irish Bank for a drink during that time. If I could afford out, I&#39;d frequent this place.

First, this restaurant is real small, with only the tables and 3 bar stools. Ordered Sushi and Sashimi sampler, $23. The sushi rice is more on sweet side versus vinegar, well textured. The platter comes with basic pieces. Salmon, tuna and spicy tuna. The fish was OK, just average. Was expecting more.

By far the best sushi I&#39;ve had in SF. We sat at the sushi bar and ordered from chef Adam who was super friendly and an amazing sushi chef. We asked him to make us whatever he thought we would like, which worked out so perfectly. We enjoyed every single bite. All the fish is really fresh, buttery and melts in your mouth.

My boyfriend and I have been looking all over San Francisco for our favorite sushi spot, Akiki&#39;s is it. They tend to get fresh fish in around the middle of the week, so if you want their very best, I would recommend going on a Wednesday night. Their fish melts in your mouth, it&#39;s that delicious!

I&#39;ve had the pleasure of coming here 3 times, and each time I was served with delicious, fresh sushi. It&#39;s a small shop that serves premium sushi so it&#39;s pretty hard to get a reservation so remember to book at least a week ahead.The first time I ventured to Akikos was lunch with my coworkers. I ordered the rainbow roll so I could try as much of their fresh fish as I could. I was pleasantly surprised with the variety I was served. It truly was a rainbow roll, and not the generic three fish roll you get at any other sushi place.The second time I came to Akikos was with my parents visiting from out of town. We ordered the special fatty toro sashimi. SO FRESH &amp; BUTTERY DELICIOUS. We also ordered a few different rolls including the rainbow roll. This rainbow roll we received was completely different from the first. Though I was a little disappointed at first, I actually ended up really appreciating that their rainbow roll is always just a variety of their fresh selection of fish for the day.The last time I went was for my birthday Lunch with my office. We ordered the omakase. Everything served, from the sashimi to the nigiri to the specialty rolls was amazing. I tried so many fish I had never really seen before on a menu anywhere. I&#39;m not an uni person and I was hoping that trying the uni here would change that, but I guess uni is just something I will never grow to appreciate. But to each their own!

I&#39;d been wanting to check out Akiko&#39;s for a while and I finally got the chance to last Saturday. I tried to make a reservation a week prior but it seemed like the restaurant didn&#39;t take reservations on weekends (there were consistently no weekend slots on open table).I got there at 7pm and the hostess informed me that they actually do take reservations on weekends, but it&#39;s usually booked weeks ahead of time. Regardless, it didn&#39;t turn out to be a problem; the hostess was super nice and was able to accommodate an 8pm table for my friend and I. We grabbed drinks at a bar close by and when we came back at 7:50pm, we were seated right away, which is pretty amazing.Our order was:(1) Saba Shio-Yaki (Mackerel)(1) Uni Nigiri(2) Spider Roll(1) Sake RollWe shared everything and honestly, it was just the right amount for two people (my friend&#39;s a guy). We weren&#39;t stuffed (which I never aim to be), but we were both satisfied after the meal. Needless to say everything was delicious. The Uni and the Mackerel were the highlights of the night and the rolls were quite unique in flavor--I&#39;ve been to many sushi places in San Francisco and around the world and I&#39;ve never had anything quite like these.Things to note:- There is no restaurant sign and the sign above it is for an Irish Pub, which is confusing and made it somewhat tricky to find.- Akiko&#39;s is open for dinner between 5:30-9pm, so by the time we were seated, they were out of a couple of menu items.Overall, an excellent experience for both my friend and I. I&#39;ll definitely come back soon.

I think I made a mistake not going for omakase. I got sashimi platter which was very fresh but nothing stood out. Then I asked the chef to make me one nigiri and so he did! $13.5 for one piece of nigiri!!! Are you kidding me? I even don&#39;t pay this much for this little piece of food in 3 Michelin star restaurants! It tasted good though but I totally feel ripped off!

My updated review would have been a zero star if it weren&#39;t for the fact that I had a really sweet server and there were a few great pieces of fish.The complaints:1) I ordered two Asahi Blacks w/ my server. Another server stops by later and tell us that they only have the tall bottles of Asahi Black. We say, okay that&#39;s fine, we&#39;ll take one of that instead. A third server comes back and pours us our beer while we were talking. He finishes and I look at my cup and realize this is not Asahi Black but just regular Asahi. This is extremely annoying, and shows the disconnect and lack of communication amongst the staff here. I don&#39;t mind paying a lot of $ to eat good food, but if I&#39;m spending that much, I do expect the restaurant to have their $h*t together. This was not acceptable, but they remedied the situation by taking away the regular Asahi and bringing out two short bottles of Asahi Black (because they only have this size in the Black).2) Omakase here is &#34;AQ&#39; - based on what&#39;s available that day. I guess that day was a sucky day because although there were a few great pieces, the overall meal experience was extremely subpar. I was not satiated and desired more, so I ordered more a la carte. Even that was disappointing. What probably made everything worse was...3) There were flies throughout our entire meal. It was the weirdest (and alarming!) thing. They were small -- bigger than fruit flies, kind of like a gnat. And they were buzzing around our face. A shoo here and there, and I figured I could get over it. But when it was landing on our plates at the end of our meal, that really killed everything for me. What&#39;s worse was that it wasn&#39;t just one or two. There were 5 flies in my glass of beer. And not just hanging out on the rim, but inside my glass, currying around. I was livid, and tried my best to not make a scene. I showed the third server the glass and he gave me a half-hearted apology.We spent $300 that night for the worst meal ever. All I could think about was, &#34;if there are that many flies out here...what does it look like where the rest of the fish is?&#34;For omakase, I&#39;d suggest going to Kusakabe.

Really didn&#39;t live up to the hype. I&#39;ve been to hundreds of sushi places, all over the world, and this falls in the lower quartile. The black maguro sashimi ($32) was the only good thing, albeit meager portions.

I&#39;ve heard great things about this place even before visiting. We decided to go one night and were able to get reservations for the same night. The food was good, albeit a bit pricey. The dinner service is a bit long. The staff was very courteous. Their fish is fresh and their wagyu nigiri... melts in your mouth. Would definitely recommend.

Akiko offers some of the freshest fish sushi I have ever eaten. This establishment is clean, and rustic-elegant in decor. Both the food and inside are artistically inspired. They serve a variety of nigiri and sashimi, perhaps six different types of rolls, some beef, fresh roe, tofu dishes and more. We enjoyed everything we ate and highly recommend this restaurant. Also, the service is very professional. Their menu changes daily, depending on the chef&#39;s preference and what is fresh (the fish arrives fresh nearly every day).

YELP, HOW CAN YOU LEAD ME ASTRAY #DISAPPOINTSince I am not a sashimi expert nor lover, this review is for all you regular sushi lovers! ~2.5 Stars but rounded down to 2 Stars because the heavy disappointment is still strongly lingering...TL;DR?? If you enjoy fresh quality raw fish/sashimi, definitely stop by here. If you want big portioned rolls that are fulfilling, then skip this place because each specialty roll came in about 5 small pieces. Your wallet will hurt tenderly if you&#39;re hungry.My friend and I came here for Weds dinner around 6PM and snagged a tiny table in the corner of the restaurant. I immediately noticed the minimalistic vibe of the restaurant. There were not many decorations and everything was made of light brown wood and had a nature color scheme. We ordered edamame and 3 specialty rolls, total bill was $32 (excluding tax and tip). I spent ~$20 for 6-7 pieces of sushi...Not. Worth. It.SPIDER $7...SOFT SHELL CRAB, AVOCADO, SCALLION, SOY PAPERGrade C: There was simply not. enough. crab. This was actually one of the worst spider rolls I&#39;ve ever had. The crab was in such small quantity that it got lost because the fresh avocado was so overwhelming.TEKKA $12...TUNA, SCALLION, AVOCADO, CRISPY SHISO, PICKLED CARROT, SESAMEGrade B: Definitely the busiest roll I ate. There were many components to this specialty roll and somehow the chefs still managed to downsize it to tiny itty bitty pieces. The tuna and veggies made this roll the crispiest one. Tasty but not worth $12.SAKE $10...FRESH SALMON, AVOCADO, SCALLION, YUZU JALAPENO, TARE, TOASTED SESAMEGrade A: My favorite roll of the night! By far, the salmon had the FRESHEST taste to it! It was so exhilarating that I wish I had more to eat :) The Yuzu jalapeno definitely gives it a nice feisty kick in your mouth! Nothing too spicy so don&#39;t be alarmed. The pieces of avocado however were unusually large in this roll, although the salmon cuts were also proportionally large. Love love love![[PROS]]++ FRESH fresh fresh Fish! The salmon and tuna were both excellent cuts and the texture was perfect enough to melt in your mouth. Hands down, quality freshness.+ Fresh Avocado and Veggies. All their avo &amp; vegs were crisp and had no signs of browning or mushy texture. Perfecto again.+ Efficient Service for sure. Friendly? Sort of, depending on who you get. My water and teas were always refilled and our table was cleaned after every consumed roll, bravo.+ Minimalistic Ambiance. I find beauty in simply things and the abstract yet quaint set-up of the restaurant was mesmerizing and much appreciated. The careful choosing and pairings of the candle, water glasses, tea cups, chopstick holder, etc. are a harmonious cohesion.[[CONS]]-- Not ENOUGH FOOD! Argh, my friend and I ordered an appetizer and 3 rolls (total= $32) and STILL left so hungry ugh. Each specialty roll we ordered consisted of 5-6 TINY pieces! How frustrating considering the prices...but their quality is spectacular though.- Too Pricey for the Food portions. I do enjoy and appreciate good quality but not at the expense of quantity and leaving the restaurant hungry. How embarrassing.- Crowded/Small Restaurant. I got lucky eating dinner at 6PM but I cannot tell you how many people waited or left during dinner time because there were simply not enough chairs or open spots at the bar.

With so many raved reviews , I decided to try it during lunch time. Had the 12 piece chef special for $32 with tofu and edamame and the bill was like $50. I didn&#39;t think it was worth it. The quality of fish was ok, didn&#39;t like the white tuna. Only thing I really enjoyed was the salmon. Other than that, for the price I can get elsewhere with same or better quality.

Came here for an 8:45 reservation with a friend. The place is tiny and has a really great vibe.. Reminded me of NYC.The fish was pretty good and fresh but unfortunately they ran out of almost everything that night so really didn&#39;t get to try much. It was good but nothing blew me away.Will have to come back for the sushi bar at an earlier time before they start selling out!

I absolutely love Akiko&#39;s. If you truly love Sushi, please try this place. The only con I can think of is price. It can get very expensive. There was a unique order of two-piece sushi that was about $32 which was really delicious but I think you get the point.. I don&#39;t even remember what it tasted like now.The receive fish overnight from Japan and they are extremely fresh and cut perfectly. Presentation enhanced tasting experience as wells as the ambiance.Servers really know their fish, it&#39;s taste, and do not hesitate to recommend other fish that you may enjoy.

Attempted to make reservations online but found it was booked up until the end of the week, we show up right when it opens at 5:30 on a Monday night and was told we could only sit at the sushi bar and cannot order the sushi/dinner sets. You can show up and wait for no-shows and obtain a seat that way too.We ordered:Fried Ika ($8)Saba Shio Yaki ($11)12 pcs sashimi ($34)Kanpachi sashimi ($23)Kuro maguro Akami ($15)Kuro Maguro- Otoro ($25)Negi Toro sushi roll ($20)Uni ($9)The slices of fish are very generously thick. The only thing I have to complain about besides the rice being a little too hard/distracting with it&#39;s brownish color is the uni we got. This was my first time trying uni and we watched the sushi chef take the last piece from the box that was very slimey and put it on the rice and for the other he grabbed a brand new uni piece from a different box that looked more fresh. I didn&#39;t want to complain or ask about it because sushi chef knows best... (see pic)Make sure you get the Nama Selection menu (that&#39;s where the premium stuff is). We didn&#39;t know about it until the sushi chef told us. They serve you the sushi roll last so you have room in your stomach to order more nigiri/sashimi or to prevent you from being too full to enjoy the good stuff.Service was good even coming from the sushi bar. I think we had more fun sitting there than a regular table because we got to order whenever we felt like it and watched the chef meticulously slice the fish and prep the other orders.This place isn&#39;t authentically Japanese but they do get all their fish from Japan so it&#39;s very fresh.

I didn&#39;t have much time (and money) when I visited, so I just ordered 2 makis as dinner, which are delicious. I think the best way to dine here is probably ask the chef to recommend some sashimi or nigiri, which however will be more expensive than $$.

Best sushi place in SF but definitely more than two dollar signs. Don&#39;t get the rolls, which are very mediocre, get omakase or at least nigiri and maybe a dish from the kitchen to fill you up since only eating nigiri here will cost 200+ to get you full. I recommend the soft shell crab.

Succulent, ultra-fresh fish draped over the best sushi rice I&#39;ve ever tasted.While somewhat more expensive than most, this sushi restaurant is worth every penny. Tucked into a tight hallway tricked out with lavish wallpaper on one side and gritty exposed industrial brick on the other, it can be hard to hear your companion on a busy night. However, that won&#39;t matter much because your mouths will be too full of scrumptious, pristine nigiri and sublimely tweaked versions of classic rolls to bother with conversation. The &#34;kitchen&#34; selection of cooked items offers the fanciest, yummiest battered fried squid and dreamy crispy fried sardines.The specials menu features rarer versions of standard offerings (here you can find smoked mackerel rather than the usual vinegar cured stuff), plus treats like young barracuda and sea urchin.Attentive servers make helpful recommendations, &amp; keep wine/sake/beer/water glasses filled.Can&#39;t wait to go back.

I hate writing bad reviews, but my experience was absolutely horrible at Akiko&#39;s. I had great meals here in the past (prior to the chef changeover), so I took two friends to their first omakase there. And we will never go back.+ The sushi was mediocre. Bland, a little chewy at times- a couple bites were unique, but nothing that blew your socks off like Kusakabe.+ We were seated at the sushi bar... at the chokepoint of the restaurant. We had reservations, so they knew we were coming, yet our seating was such that we were right next to the servers&#39; station and we got bumped and jostled the whole time.+ We got the bill, and it was pricey for the sushi we got (no toro, no uni, no drinks, and still $150 per). So I asked to clarify a charge. They said yes, they made a mistake... they had *undercharged* us. They took the bill, and ADDED nearly $100 to the bill.+ The service overall was haughty and rude. Water splashed on me at the beginning, had to repeatedly request ginger, no menus until we requested, and the servers&#39; attitude was what you&#39;d expect from pimply high school students- snickering, pointing, absent when you needed them.If you want to spend $150+ on bad sushi with bad service, by all means, book a seating at Akiko&#39;s. I was wondering why reservations were so easy to get- now I know.

My boyfriend and I came here for dinner on a Monday night. We decided to go with the omakase based on majority of the existing Yelp reviews.Ambiance: It is definitely a nice place to go for dinner, but keep in mind the restaurant is quite small.Sushi: The sushi is quite fresh and i liked the three nigiri&#39;s that came from Hokkaido (scallop, shrimp, and uni) and the A5 wagyu. Those items were quite delicious, but the other nigiri&#39;s that were included in the omakase didn&#39;t really create a wow factor. Reading all of the existing reviews really put my standards sky high and I just wasn&#39;t that impressed. Maybe I came on a bad day? I don&#39;t know, but this dining experience definitely made myself think I&#39;d rather go to another Japanese restaurant that offered a much better Omakase dinner.Price: The grand total including tax and tip was about $250, so if you&#39;re not ready to splurge, then this is probably not a spot you would want to go to.Service: The service was great and very attentive.Tip: The sushi chef that served us suggested to come on a Tuesday or Wednesday because they usually received their shipments on those days, so there would be more variety for the Omakase dinner set.

The Omakase experience here is definitely worth it. Got to try so many fish you can&#39;t find elsewhere. Their menu changes often depending what fish they can get their hands on... but I can tell you all their fish are FRESH!!! That texture from each one gives your mouth a surprised feeling. Whether it melts in your mouth, firm yet soft when you bite into it, or whatever. Hope that description didn&#39;t come off a lil dirty but I can&#39;t describe it enough! Ranging from $90-$100/person with a very generous portion. My omakase started off with a spinach salad, then oysters, then many pieces of sashimi and nigiri. It was enough to be full for the night leaving a lil room for dessert.Few items that highlighted my night was the monkfish liver... this was creamy, buttery, and reminds me a lot of Uni but taste totally different. Tried two different types of mackerel, and can&#39;t forget the Toro!! The wagyu beef nigiri was awesome being the last piece that complimented my entire meal. It was just amazing.This place is reservations ONLY so please reserve on OpenTable so you won&#39;t be disappointed by being a walk-in. Reserve at least a week in advance for a good time slot. Only regret is I should&#39;ve called to request seats at the bar. I missed all the action from the sushi chef. Until next time.

What would I do without you Yelp?My friend and I happened to both be in SF for work and managed to meet for an impromptu lunch. I pulled up ye&#39; &#39;bible&#39; and did a quick search for sushi that was open now (12pm), up to two $$, and within reasonable distance.Akiko. Bingo!!As time was of the essence, I grabbed a cab and bee lined it over, from Moscone West to the venue was roughly 10 min.Storefront is nondescript and homie had to slow his roll to find this little gem. I located my friend at the sushi bar and settled in. Oooh, purse hooks - gal&#39;s best friend! Of course I felt giddy inside, little things like this excite me.I quickly surveyed the place - it&#39;s definitely on the smaller side. Sushi bar is L-shaped and seats 8-10 give or take. I&#39;m not too sure how many patrons can sit down for a table but it looked like it could accommodate 5 different parties. Luckily you can call to make a reservation or do it online.Sushi chefs and wait staff provided top notch service, even though they teased me a little while I was taking my foodie photos :PThe food was great, all very fresh and reasonably priced! I ordered the Duo: with 4pc nigiri and saba-shio yaki and it was dee-licious!! $21 for all that + miso soup. My friend got a Duo as well but opted for salmon and sashimi. While waiting for our order we spied on a dish that looked utterly amazing, we couldn&#39;t contain our oogling so inquired what it was: a ha! Poki bowl!We caved and ordered one but judiciously decided to split. At first I was sad inside because I knew it was going to be bomb dot com and was feeling too greedy to share BUT in the end I was glad we went halvesies.Their hot green tea was a smart choice for an afternoon lunch and when you have to go back to work, although the sake + beer was quite tempting!!Anyway, whenever I&#39;m back in SF and craving sushi + yummy saba - you&#39;ll be sure to find my ass parked on one of their bar stools, this time with hot sake+beer in hand, oh yeah.

As a visitor to the Bay Area with limited time, a sushi bar visit was squeezed into my tight itinerary.I did my research and found this place.I took my wife and daughter here, and it didn&#39;t disappoint.We were seated on time, and was greeted by a very friendly sushi chef. This place gave a good vibe and the fish quality was amazing.We took the omakase and every piece of sushi he served us delivered great values of authenticity and freshness. We ended the meal with this seared Wagyu beef sushi that was to die for.I will definitely come back after such a positive experience.

Get a reservation for bar seating, enjoy a delightful kaiseki style dinner with the wonderful chefs.The omakase menu is updated on their website so there&#39;s no need to go into all the items and order that you&#39;ll be served, but it is absolutely the best fine-dining experience I have had so far!You will definitely notice the superbness of all the ingredients that are used, from the soy sauce to the toro. I did not find any of the items lackluster, every piece was a beautiful mix of flavors. A few of the new flavors I experienced here was the kelp konbu cha, a surprisingly sweet and buttery scallop, truffle with unagi wrapped in egg, and the zuke chutoro (lightly seared bluefin medium fatty tuna cured in soy sauce).Another a la carte item I encourage people to try is the BBQ white eel. I found this very special since most of the unagi you will eat in your life is pre-packaged and frozen. The chefs at Kusakabe buy their own eel and prepare it themselves. Even the sauce is prepped in-house, eel-based.I can&#39;t stop thinking about the experience I had here, I&#39;ll definitely be coming back.

I had high hopes for delicious sushi in San Francisco. We came here on our honeymoon and the restaurant knew it was our first meal on our trip.There were many items we wanted that were unavailable, like avocado. Not really sure how a sushi place in a huge city runs out of avocado. The service was unremarkable - the waiter seemed harried even though it was a quiet Monday evening. Bummer.

3.5 STARSFor the longest time I though the unlabeled Akiko&#39;s Restaurant was an Irish Bar (in fact, there is one around the corner). I&#39;ve heard such great things about Akiko&#39;s for years, I had let myself imagine so many incorrect details. There was no old man sushi chef, and no little old lady wife serving a few small tables - there were hipster white people cutting sashimi and searing fish. The place was not especially Japanese or traditional, but rather modern and new.All the dishes were ordered were pretty good, the fish was really fresh and didn&#39;t leave me extremely hangry... just a little hangry. I enjoyed the food here, but it doesn&#39;t meet the hype.* SHRIMP TEMPURA ($8) - 3.5 STARS:Lightly battered and flash fried, 4 piece tiger prawns with ginger broth.I typically don&#39;t like tempura but this was nice because it tasted like it was freshly battered and fried. The tiger prawns were on the small side, which ultimately was a good thing because it was delicate in texture. The overall taste was good but it wasn&#39;t mind blowing.* DEEP FRIED SOFT SHELL CRAB ($??) - 3.5 STARS:Lightly battered and flash fried. This was delicious, fresh and tasty just like the tempura shrimp.* TUNA SHOULDER NIGIRI ($12) - 3.5 STARS:This sashimi special was nice and marbled, it reminded me of Saru and Ichi because it was so overpriced, but comparatively the flavor and quantity was miles ahead. It was good, but I&#39;ve still had better.* SASHIMI SAMPLER 12 PC ($35) - 3 STARS:There were definitely highlights (trout wow), average pieces (salmon, yellow tail), and passable pieces (octopus so chewy). This chef&#39;s special is fixed, too bad....* RAINBOW ROLL ($??) - 4 STARS:The rainbow roll was good, better than your standard rainbow roll (ahem We Be Sushi). It comes with 8 pieces and is decently portioned compared to most other Japanese restaurants in the city (ahem Saru, Ichi....). But again, it wasn&#39;t particularly mindblowing. To me a good rainbow roll is large, has fresh fish, and delicious sauces on top. It was good but nothing to return for.* SAKE FLUKE ($??) - 5 STARS:This was a 5-piece roll, a concoction of radish, avocado, salmon sashimi and several items I can&#39;t remember, topped with unagi sauce. One of the favorites of the night.Overall Akiko&#39;s was good, an upscale sushi restaurant with fresh fish and tops other famous Japanese sushi spots in the city. Perhaps the thing to get is the Omakase (ranges $99-110). While I enjoyed my experience here, I don&#39;t think the value was there. I still prefer Wayo for something more traditional.

Sashimi here is wonderful and melt in your mouth. I often get the sashimi tasting here. I don&#39;t think the rolls here are that great. I think the udon noodle sets and other items on the menu are very good but it changes from time to time. If you have a group over 4 then this may not be a place for you. Agashi tofu was great here.

Too good for signs, I suppose. I had to call and the hostess ran outside to wave us in. Golly. There was maybe one or two friendly faces the whole time we were there.Anyway, small details like when one of the waiters were setting our table, he rudely picked up my phone and set it aside so he could situate the sauce bowl ever so perfectly by the side of my plate. What place have you been that they&#39;re allowed to touch your property without asking??? Unbelievable. And he kept coming back to adjust my sauce bowl whenever I moved it. Come on.I was steaming already.The other waiter and the busboy were quite friendly and the food was expertly crafted. However, when you piss off your patrons square off the bat, it&#39;s hard to not see red for the rest of the time.I ordered everything I wanted to taste and it was masterful and divine. Expensive, yes, but the food is worth it. Just.... Up the service people.

Seriously the best sushi we&#39;ve ever had. Went all out and got the omakase. Totally worth the $264 for the two of us, 18 bites each with 2 large Asahi&#39;s! Some of the best tastes ever and actually left pleasantly full. The quality of the fish here ruined every sushi restaraunt we have back at home. Standouts were the bluefin, mackerel, barracuda, sea urchin, and king salmon. We will definitely come back on future trips to San Francisco.If you love sushi, go, and omakase your heart out.

My friend and I have never had better fish ever. OMG good. The salad in itself was amazing. Rolls were amazing. The host was really nice and the waiter was awesome with recommendations. Such a great find and worth the money!!!

I don&#39;t even know where to begin with Akikos. My favorite japanese restaurant is still hands down Tekka in SF for their simple authentic japanese dishes but when I come to Akikos I definitely get more variety and twist to my sushi.I&#39;ve been here twice and both times had omakase (chefs choice) and they were both times amazingThe only difference is the first time I sat at a table and because of that the waiter chooses what fish you will be servedIt&#39;s better to sit at the bar because then it will really be chefs choice since they do the cutting and servingHere&#39;s a list of what we ate and everything was just so delicious!Umimasu nigiriKamasu nigiriChu toroKinedai nigiriAkei mitsu nigiriEnsui UNi nigiriKanpachi nigiriNama hotate nigiriAmami nigiriSayori nigiriRussian UNi nigiriTennen hirame nigiriBaby anagoTip: always sit at the bar for omakase and make a reservation ahead of time they&#39;re always booked for dinner especially on weekends!Enjoy!

If you are looking for a unique sushi dining experience where you can sample a wonderful array of rare and exotic fishes then look no further than Akiko&#39;s.Omakase is the only way to go but be warned it can add up quickly. I totally believe it was worth every penny and would gladly go back for another special occasion.Side note: BEST Agadashi Tofu I have had to date!Overall ThoughtsCome to Akiko&#39;s with an open mind and an open wallet and I promise you won&#39;t leave disappointed!

Good not great (as is most sushi in San Francisco), I&#39;d be comfortable giving it 4 stars if were less expensive. Pricy for a sushi place that isn&#39;t outstanding, but you&#39;ll get a nice meal.Reservations are recommended because this location has very limited seating, but two of us went around 7pm on a Thursday and got seated right away. They have a selection of sake. Fresh fish, the waiters will happily tell you what the best cuts of the day are. If you&#39;re looking to fill yourself up (always a drain on your wallet when talking sushi), expect to pay $30-50 a head.My sushi-expert (I&#39;m not one) friend says this place typically does great nagiri and less great sashimi, so my advice is go for whatever the day&#39;s selection of fresh nagiri is.

We stopped in for lunch before our flight back to Orange County. The food is good, service was attentive with clearing plates however, the hostess was rude upon our arrival and her attitude was cold. One of the sushi chef tended to us but the atmosphere was lukewarm. We tried a couple of nigiri (kanpachi, toro, ankimo), kani age, salmon roll, and the blue crab cucumber sunomono. It used to be one of my favorite lunch options when I worked in the City off Bush and Montgomery. I don&#39;t know if I&#39;d come back here again.

I rarely give 5 stars but this place commands 5 big ones.Dining here was hands down the best sushi experience I&#39;ve ever had in my life. The omokase price is $80-100 depending on what you&#39;re served (it will be itemized on your receipt). They say you&#39;ll need at least 2 hours there for the omokase experience but that&#39;s only when it&#39;s really busy like 5+ people ordering at the same time. From the time we arrived at 6PM, we finished everything by 7:30PM.Anyway, back to the important issue, is this price worth it? Absolutely. If you&#39;re going to throw down $100 on dinner for one person, this is well worth it, especially if you&#39;re a sushi lover and you want to experience one of the best sushi meals. I haven&#39;t been to Jiro Ono&#39;s restaurant in Japan, but I bet this place will make you want to go just to know in your heart you&#39;ve tried some of the best sushi ever.The omokase consists of an appetizer, 6 pieces sashimi and 10 pieces nigiri. I don&#39;t know the exact naming of everything I ate, but here is the list from my receipt and I also posted the pictures of my meal on Yelp.1) Ohitashi2) Sunomono Octopus3) Umimasu4) Hamachi5) Shiromaguro6) Shiroebi7) Uni8) Kanpachi9) Tai10) Katsuo11) Kamasu12) Kinmedai13) Aka Mutsu14) Hara Sake15) Kuro MaguroMake sure you make a reservation because I don&#39;t even think they take walk-ins. Also, parking is almost impossible in this downtown area so take public transportation and plan accordingly. Service was excellent, the servers were knowledgable and my water glass was never empty. You will be 100% satisfied with your meal here if you are one to appreciate delicious/fresh fish.

Fresh, delicious fish. The place is tiny; make sure you make a reservation. Not quite sure how bar seating is determined. Their website said to note it in your reservation, so we requested it on our Open Table reservation but bar seating we did not get. Aside from that, we had a good experience. Tasty food and friendly and attentive service.

You definitely get what you pay for in terms of quality not quantity. I came here during lunch with a friend and had a wonderful culinary experience.I ate all their sashimi options. Yum!Service was a little slow but very helpful and nice. When I&#39;ve got money to blow I&#39;ll go here.Parking is simple when you head straight to the garage near by. Just call and ask where!

The boyfriend took me here for my birthday dinner last July. From the outside, it looked like your ordinary sushi restaurant. Which made me almost mad that he took me here when we could have just went to our usual go-to spot.But once I sat down and saw the menu, I knew why. It&#39;s pricier than your typical sushi restaurants. But the price is really what you pay for. We ordered tuna sashimi and it tasted so fresh. It didn&#39;t taste frozen and thawed fish. But literally tasted like the sushi chef had just cut off the fresh flesh from a tuna he caught hours before the restaurant opened.Besides the sashimi, we also ordered the spider roll (very tasty, soft shell crab was crisp and not soggy), and the ika (calamri). The ika was my favorite. It was so addicting to eat, especially with my saporro.We also ordered the uni but the server said they had run out. Which was a bummer because we&#39;ve never had uni before and wanted to see what all the fuss was about. Instead, our server recommended we tried the wagyu. And we were really glad we did. That was probably our favorite thing we ate all night. The beef was so tender and left your mouth salivating for more.Overall a good experience. Staff was very friendly. Place was very clean. It is tiny and can be arm to arm with the table next to you. But very intimate for a special date.

This place is great!!It&#39;s actually my 2nd time coming here. My first time, I simply stumbled upon this place via yelp and didn&#39;t really have that high of an expectation until they surprised me by how traditional their techniques are.I grew up in Asia where Japanese food is everywhere, easily way better than places in the U.S, and tons more affordable. So it takes a lot for me to five this place 5 stars!This time, I got the Omakase and spent $117 excluding tip - I honestly felt the price was fair given the quality of fish that was served to me.My omakase included1. ponzu vinaigrette Japanese seaweed + smoked scallop - delicious, not only am I a big sucker for anything yuzu flavored, but this appetizer was balanced with sweet, salty, spicy, and sour.2. big eyed tuna poke + ponzu albacore - I didn&#39;t care for the tuna poke, I&#39;m not a big fan of overly marinated sashimi and I also get this impression that poke is made with scrap pieces. But I was pleasantly surprised by the albacore. I normally dislike albacore since it tends to have a strong taste. The texture is leaner and stringier, if not sliced right, the fish tends to look spoiled. But the chef put it together nicely. Ponzu sauce was elevated by a few additions (one of which being ginger), and the albacore was garnished with chiffonade shiso which so I saw the chef chop himself. This guy has good basics!3. Cod &amp; Ocean Trout - The ocean trout was fresh and good, but it&#39;s like salmon so I don&#39;t have a whole lot to say about it. But the cod was delicious! The chef had stacked a small piece of seared meat and added a very light smokey dimension.4. Santa Barbara Uni and horse Mackerel - Santa Barbara Uni was cream and delicious and I thought I was satisfied, but no, I later found out in my Omakase that there&#39;s an even better one.5. Shima Aji (Striped Jack) and overnighted Hotate (Scallop) - Besides uni, I also really love scallop, but I like it served in a very specific way - butterflied, dressed with yuzu, with a pinch of kosher salt. But today&#39;s scallop was different, not creamy and sweet like how I normally get to have it, but it was more like crispy! I suppose that is how fresh scallop taste like! The fibers are very distinct and separates easily as you chew it.Ok you get the point there are actually 5 more courses after that which two nigiri sushis each.. But the biggest highlight of my meal was probably the Tokujyo Uni. I didn&#39;t think I would be able to tell the flavors apart from the different kinds of uni... oh but you can! Tokujyo is much much sweeter. Now I&#39;ll never forget Tokujyo Uni as my favorite kind of Uni.

Tonight was the second time we&#39;ve visisted Akiko&#39;s. The first time we went was while spontaneously walking by it but were rejected due to not having a reservation.The place isn&#39;t very big and also kind of hard to find since there&#39;s really no signage outside. Just look for the house number.The food is honesty, mediocre and over-priced. Saw so many of my friend&#39;s posts about this place and raving about the quality of the fish that I was really excited to try it. The A5 wagyu nigiri was good but having tasted A5 in Tokyo, for some reason it didn&#39;t match up to my previous experience (maybe the transport diluted the taste =P). The nigiri and sashimi were also just meh. The toro barely had that fatty taste to it. All in all, would not go here again. I don&#39;t mind paying money for quality, but this place is not up to par with some of the other better Japanese establishments within the City or Silicon Valley.

It&#39;s my first review, but this place deserves it!1. Excellent service - we walked in a few minutes before closing but we were greeted warmly. One of the tables was clearing out so we were seated pretty quickly. The servers were polite, friendly and incredibly professional. They even took the time to carefully arrange our plates right before the food was about to arrive! Great attention to detail.2. Fresh and delicious fish. We ordered a couple of nigiri and also some of the rolls. The salmon roll is so delicious! It&#39;s 5 pieces but every piece has large, juicy buttery fresh fish which is perfectly seasoned. The scallops nigiri was probably one of the most fresh and tasty scallops I&#39;ve had (and I loveeee scallops!) It was so juicy, had great texture and bursting with that delicious scallop taste! Halfway through the meal and we knew we were coming back.In summary, great food, great service! Will definitely become part of our regular rotation of places to eat near the financial district.

Pricey sushi but is fresh and delicious. In order to feel full here, I would have to order about $60 worth of food. The Sashimi Tasting comes with 12 pcs of salmon, tuna, etc and is very good but leaves you still feeling hungry. We also ordered the tekka and negihama rolls which were excellent- I highly recommend! Both have raw tuna and are quite tasty.Despite the yummy food and spending $60 between two people, my friend and I were still hungry after this meal and decided to get ramen afterwards to feel fully satisfied. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a great value here so I won&#39;t be coming back.

One of my friends is quite the regular here so we get the Yakuza treatment when Im tagging along. Sit at the bar and go Omakase. I&#39;d recommend that at any traditional old school sushi bar. However Akiko&#39;s is not completely that type of place. At the bar they may serve that tradition, where you sit, the way you eat, etc, but it ends there. They&#39;ve got a good mix of tradition and modernity that is fitting of a San Francisco restaurant.There are some places I go to when I want complete tradition. This is not it. The folks here understand said tradition but have put their own tasteful modern touches to the cuisine. I had way too many courses to remember them all but I think I&#39;ve uploaded enough pics for you to figure it out. The hospitality, quality and taste are as good as any Edo influenced sushi place I&#39;ve been to. If you love Japanese food, you owe it to yourself to get yourself to the bar and let them take care of you.

I have been to Akiko&#39;s twice now, and I actually had fairly different experiences both times. I am not sure whether I was at opposite ends of a spectrum, or whether one was more in line with the norm.Anyway, the pros: tremendous, memorable selection of fish (e.g. barracuda and some delicious marinated toro), and everything was very fresh and tasty. Also, not all that expensive, really.The cons: the nigiri/sashimi was the only part of the menu that I thought was creative. The rolls I had this time were a bit unimaginative and only marginally better than the average sushi joint.The first time I ate here, our waiter offered to make recommendations and I think he might have gone off-menu for some rolls. They were amazing and unique, and he paired them with other dishes to boot. This time, our waiter seemed hurried and did not offer (and I did not ask, which admittedly is on me). But then he forgot part of our order.Anyway, Akiko&#39;s is still quite good and worth making a reservation at, if you know you&#39;re going to in the area. I would definitely go back, and I&#39;m still giving it 4 stars because even my second visit was really quite good.

Nice vibe and decor. But like one previous Yelp review, I too sat infront of the sushi chef who appeared to have &#34;dirty nails&#34;. Despite how good the sushi was, the nails were a distraction... I needed answers! As I was about to exit I pulled one of the waiters aside and politely raised the question. He told me the chef got that from sharpening the blade and that leaves a stain. Ah, at last mystery solved.

I was really excited to eat at Akiko&#39;s, and I am pleased to say it did not disappoint at all! We made reservations about three weeks earlier but still could not get a table until 8:30 pm. We were several minutes late because we walked past the restaurant twice without noticing it - there is no sign! Once we realized where we were, we found a very small and intimate restaurant with an exceedingly friendly and accommodating staff. We opted for the omakase dinner and relied on the chef&#39;s recommendations. Not one of our courses disappointed. We had an excellent bottle of wine to accompany our food, which was recommended by our server. For the last course, our server asked if we would be interested in the Wagyu beef. Coming from beef country, we were not really looking for beef but agreed to give it a try. That was the best piece of beef I have ever eaten. The service at this tiny restaurant was spectacular. If you are in the area and want some excellent sushi and Japanese fare, you cannot go wrong with Akiko&#39;s!

Such a wonderful dining experience! My friend is a sushi master, he basically tried all Top 10 sushi places in SF and took me to Akiko. Since my stomach can&#39;t digest rice,so every sushi pieces I had was in sashimi only. The Kobe beef was a must try. Seasoned with aged soy sauce and dipped in egg yolk, and finally rolled together with Japan-imported seaweed ($1 per slice according to the chef). One taste you would never forget. I tried all kinds of oily fish they had that night and they were all heavenly tasty. Also three kinds of uni, two from Japan and one from Russia. I was even licking the spoon after finishing my bite. Five stars for sure.

I came with a group of 5 for an early lunch and the place was maybe half-full. The restaurant is pretty small, so I&#39;d recommend a reservation, especially for dinner. There&#39;s no actual sign outside with the restaurant name so it&#39;s easy to miss, but it&#39;s right by the Irish Bank.Food is a little pricey here, but not outrageous, especially given the high quality of the fish. Definitely worth the spend, though I probably wouldn&#39;t suggest coming here if you were really hungry. I had the Sashimi Tasting, which was 12 pieces of amazing sashimi for $34, and would definitely recommend it.Service is great here - friendly and attentive - and the atmosphere is pretty cozy.==============================SASHIMI TASTING (12pc) $34 - 5/5[2 pc salmon, 2 pc tuna, 2 pc mature snapper, 3 pc white tuna, 3 pc yellowtail]The sashimi is AMAZING here! Super fresh, really great texture and pretty generous cuts. My favorites of the five were the white tuna and the yellowtail. Both were incredibly soft and basically melts in your mouth. The other sashimi were definitely good quality too, but had a little more of a chew to them

The quality of the sushi was good. Nothing amazing. But the value is terrible. Really, it should be rated $$$ or $$$$. My wife and I went after having a lot of food at happy hour, spent $130 here, and left still hungry. The portions are tiny and very expensive. Expect to spend anywhere from $4-$10 per BITE. To top it off, the waiter offered to surprise us with a few items he liked, we accepted, and he served us the most expensive items, 4 bites of food for $40.

Seriously this place is the best sushi place I tried in my life because their rice is so different from regular sushi place; and especially sooooo chewy :) However, I couldn&#39;t find this place easily because the outside was under construction. Also, I saw a lot of reviews about if you don&#39;t reserve, you have to wait for a while. However, when we went for a lunch, there was no one in the place which we were free to go in :)When I went in there, this place is really cute and small. However, if I knew their prices, I WOULD NOT COME HERE! IT IS FREAKING EXPENSIVE!!! Seriously, 6 nigiri costs $26 WOW. I know this place&#39;s sushi is so good and awesome, but if the prices are so high, I wouldn&#39;t come back to try it. I don&#39;t know why this place has only $$, they should have $$$. Also, it is so hard to get a parking because it is SF.

Akiko&#39;s knows tuna.At the Fallfest event yesterday (a food+wine event benefiting Meals on Wheels SF) I ate food from Akiko&#39;s for the first time. They served a chopped tuna belly marinated in 2-year-old, aged soy sauce that was soaking in applewood...what???? Yup, 2-year old soy sauce as a marinade. This makes the soy sauce not so salty and the flavor of the marinade really enhances the tuna. The fish sits atop a soft roll of sushi rice.Outstanding! really really fantastic.There was also a second bite of slice raw tuna which was silken and also wonderful.If I go out in the near future which, of course I will (!), and I&#39;m in the mood for tuna; I&#39;m going to make a bee-line for Akiko&#39;s Restaurant.

We were visiting SF for the weekend and want to start off with a good Japanese meal. We found great review on Yelp and decide to dine here.Without reservation on Friday noon, we had to wait for ~40 minutes but the hostess was friendly and helpful. The restaurant texted when the seat was ready.We both ordered Chirashi which is not on the lunch menu($30). The selection of fish were plain and the rice were mediocre. Overall, the quality is fair but I definitely had better at the price range.p.s: We love sushi and had sushi at Tokyo, New York and LA multiple times in past couple years. Akiko was not memorable.

One of my goals for my vacation to San Francisco was to have &#34;real&#34; sushi. Akiko&#39;s was definitely the right choice for that. A tiny little sushi bar tucked away a block away from the China Gate without any sort of signage, it&#39;s exactly the sort of gem everyone tries to find.I went for a light lunch while waiting for a friend and was seated right away without a reservation, despite the tiny size. They had a VERY impressive sake selection; unfortunately I only had time for one glass. I ate the Hokkaido scallop sashimi, and a spicy tuna roll. Service was very quick and attentive, and prices very reasonable for good quality sushi. A perfect spot to pop into for a quick lunch, or for catching up with a friend over several glasses of sake. I&#39;d return in a heartbeat.

This place is too expensive for pity food and slow service, at least on Mondays.I gave a 2 star instead of 1 because their monk fish liver nigiri and wagyu with black truffle are delicious. But that&#39;s all the pros I can think of. Here comes the why-so-bad.Since Akiko is so famous for its uni, we came on an empty stomach and with great expectation of uni. However, upon our arrival, we are informed there is NO UNI, NO TORO, NO ANYTHING FANCY! They don&#39;t even have broiled black cod. Because their supplies depend on shipments and deliveries doesn&#39;t come in on Mondays. THEN DON&#39;T OPEN ON MONDAYS FOR GOD SAKE!We started with sashimi. 1. They didn&#39;t ration according to party size, so we have to negotiate who eats what, who does not get to eat what. Great that&#39;s considerate of the chefs! 2. Their sashimi tasted like they have been sitting in air for too long: dry exterior!Then, a 30 minute wait......... till the next set of nigiri. ARE YOU KIDDING ME! We basically sat there, and became hungry again. Then we started to munch on the ginger. It was like hell! During the 30 minute, the adjacent table paid a check; a new table came in, and got served TWICE!So here come the nigiri, pretty mediocre, except the monk fish liver and wagyu, which probably stood out due to the mediocrity of everything else.Yeah then we got some hot dish like agedashi tofu and hamachi collar, AFTER ANOTHER 30 MINUTES! Probably longer, we lost count. It&#39;s ironic that all of us feels the salad on the side of the hamachi collar is superb, peak of this pathetic dinner.And this tormenting ongoing hunger got us a nearly $400 bill! With tip, we each paid $91. Oh damn I type with rage.So whenever you think of coming, DON&#39;T. Kusakabe, Maruya, Roka Akor... You name it. Anywhere with the same price level is so goooood in comparison to this one.

Really great spot for the sushi aficionado. There wasn&#39;t a visible sign outside, so that may be a little confusing, but it&#39;s the corner spot just outside the alleyway. Pretty cozy and small in there, the hostess will actually tuck you in if you&#39;re sitting against the wall (amusing and kinda of a strange aspect of what otherwise feels like a more upscale dining place). Service is very good, polite and attentive. Small, more traditional menu for sushi (hooray!) with more of a focus on fresh fish and &#34;gourmet styled basic&#34; rolls (your Sake roll will have more than just salmon and avocado) - which by the way, was delicious. They use brown rice, and the seaweed was a little moist/soft so it made it a tad chewy, but the pieces were all bite sized so it wasn&#39;t a problem.Tried the barracuda nigiri (fresh catch that day) and the white tuna toro - both were delicious, fresh - no fishiness, the toro was buttery of course, and the barracuda was great - had the texture more on a steak side of the fish (like swordfish) rather then the buttery thick slab of salmon.Easily could overspend here, so maybe save it for a special occasion, and definitely make reservations!

Probably the best high end sushi you can get in the city for this price. There may be better spots, but not at this price range in the city. You are getting a good deal for the quality.Sit at the bar. You will be restricted from the kitchen dishes, but that shouldn&#39;t be why your here. I always get the hotate (scallop). Come for lunch and get the shiro toro (white tuna belly) -- they&#39;ll run out by dinner time.If you&#39;re a sake/maguro (salmon/tuna) type of sushi eater--like most American sushi eaters start out to be--get out of your comfort zone and try the omakase to get exposed to the good stuff. This is the place to do it without burning your wallet.Also, the wagyu nigiri always blows newcomers away. If you&#39;ve never had this extremely marbled meat, you must get it.

I&#39;ve had consistently good experiences here. I usually sit at the bar and order omakase. So many choices. Stuff you don&#39;t find outside of Tokyo. Well prepared in an understated but elegant setting.The chefs do a good job of understanding what&#39;s out of bounds for you. Tell them what you like and don&#39;t like. Have an open mind.I do find that the service disappears at times. This might be because I&#39;m at the bar. They do need to be more attentive to your drink level. However it&#39;s not enough for me to knock it down a star.Make a reservation. It fills up fast.

This small hidden gem downtown for delicious, fresh quality sashimi. Always on the hunt to see which restaurants have the best sashimi. We ordered the omikase. Chefs choice, and you can let him know what you don&#39;t prefer; personally don&#39;t particularly care for shrimp or uni. The sashimi choices were bomb. Perfect portion, perfect flavoring and perfect amount of wasabi. Would most definitely come back. If you want rolls, that&#39;s great too, but if you&#39;re here, so the sashimi :) well worth the money and experience! L

This place is definitely a $$$$ place, not $$!We got lucky to have the table right away without reservation on Fri night. The place is small but totally modern and warm. We ordered the nigiri on the special menu and THEY ARE ALL GOOD! The must-try one is Wagyu beef with truffle.However, I dont really impress with the negi toro roll. It is a bit soggy to me.Our service is friendly and nice. He came back to our table ( or his table) to check on us frequently.I think Akiko&#39;s price completely beats sushi Ran but not sure about the quality. They both have an excellent fine dishes but I obsessed more with sushi Ran&#39;s rolls and small dishes.

One of the best sushi and sashimi experiences in SF. Came here for a friend&#39;s bday and it had the perfect ambiance for a small, intimate setting and excellent service.We ordered the omakase and truly enjoyed each dish and experience topped off wagu beef that I&#39;m still dreaming about!All the nigiri/sashimi was super tasty and fresh!Also, I brought in a couple desserts for the birthday girl and not only did they NOT charge a fee for outside desserts but they even plated them beautifully for us!!! This really is the perfect place for special occasions- highly recommend!

My boyfriend and I had dinner here two weeks ago and it was the best sushi meal we&#39;ve ever had! We both did omakase and while it was pricey, it was worth every cent. We have been blessed (or cursed, depending on how you see it) with really big appetites so our omakase meal ended being something like 24 courses. And oh my lord, it was good.We started off with a sashimi trio, followed by endless rounds of nigiri. Each plating was beautiful and delicious. I&#39;m a big fan of the sushi chef seasoning for you instead of dunking it in wasabi and soy sauce yourself. Everything was perfectly balanced, and I could still taste the different, delicate flavors of each piece of fish. My favorites were the scallops, Hokkaido uni, Russian uni, crab, salmon roe, wagyu, mackerel, and basically everything else we had. It was all perfect.We sat at the sushi bar, which is my favorite because we chatted with the chef and he selected some pieces for us based on what we said we liked. We also chatted with some of the other patrons and the overall atmosphere at the sushi bar is very friendly. It&#39;s definitely the way to go.

I&#39;ve finally gotten around to writing a review for Akiko&#39;s after my third visit last night. Each experience has been just as amazing as the last! Always on the search for authentic Japanese food, especially fresh sashimi, I always know I am getting quality ingredients here.They have a variety of unique rolls, and all of them are different in some way. The volcano roll is no longer on the dinner menu, but it is one of the most unique rolls I&#39;ve ever had. The Forty-Niner roll is one of my new favorites, with a shrimp tempura roll topped with salmon sashimi and the most thinly sliced lemon. That little extra lemon zest on top of the salmon made for the perfect bite, and added something that a lot of rolls don&#39;t have.All of the raw fish that they have to offer is amazing. I recommend ordering a dish in which you can get a good sampling of the different variety. My favorite is always some kind of salmon, but their toro is also great. The hamachi kama seems to have gotten a bigger portion size, but the fish is grilled perfectly and paired with a fresh salad and pickled vegetables. The ponzu dipping sauce adds a nice acidity to the moist, buttery fish. Even the skin is grilled to a crispness that makes you devour the entire thing down to the bone.The dining experience at Akiko&#39;s will not disappoint, and if you&#39;re willing to pay for high quality food, then this is the place to go to again and again.

Reservation required it seems. Hard to find location! I walked right by it at first. Thankfully the chopstick using patron the window gave it away. Amazing fish! Freshh and some of the best in the city. It is pricey, but I had a great experience here that seemed to be off the beaten path and pretty secluded to enjoy your food!I will never forget the table next to me that ordered a bottle of wine and then got into a diatribe with the waitress about how the bottle was tart and had her fancy son agree that they&#39;ve had many bottles of this wine and theirs was tainted. Seriously no shame. The waitress did her best to appease them, but what a son and mother shitshow. A whole opened bottle of wine gone. I&#39;ll pass judgment and figure they were sommeliers of some sort, but maam you&#39;re here for the sushi not the wine. Hope you got your rocks off on that.Cheers!

It&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve last ventured to Akiko&#39;s, but I still recall the state of bliss I was in with my friends when we stumbled upon this little popular sushi restaurant. First off, you must make a reservation here to guarantee a spot during the weekends. My friends and I were fortunate enough to grab a table right as they opened without a reservation, but we definitely lucked out. As we settled in, all the tables quickly filled up, so we knew this was a legit spot!We ordered calamari and several rolls, and everything came out extremely fresh and delicious. The calamari was the best I&#39;ve ever had, so here&#39;s a tip: get the calamari!Friendly and hospitable service paired with delicious food result in a return fosho!

It&#39;s impossible for me to take a trip to San Francisco without trying to find some good sushi. This place looked like it could be good, so I gave it a shot.This place does not have a sign on the outside. I showed up to the approximate location it should have been on the map, looked inside the building, and saw a sushi bar. It turned out to be the correct one.I sat down, and just asked the chef to make me 8-10 pieces of sushi. As far as I&#39;m concerned, you can&#39;t tell how good a sushi place is unless you have omakase.I&#39;m not entirely certain what everything I had was, but here are a few of the selections that stood out:baby barracuda - this cured fish had a light, but distinct, flavor, not as briny as more common cured fish like mackerel.scallops - fresh and delicious. Not hard to find scallops, but when they&#39;re done right, it&#39;s a treat.Russian uni - I&#39;m not sure where they got this, but it seems like it&#39;s not quite as sweet as its West Coast counterpart.Toro hand roll - I requested this one; very well done, with pieces of pickled radish to augment the flavor.kinki - AKA shortspine thornyhead aka idiot fish. Turns out this little guy is endangered! Mark that one off the list...This wasn&#39;t all; it&#39;s just what I recall off the top of my head. I also had tamago made with a chicken stock that made it some of the most distinct, and tasty, tamago I have tasted.Besides offering a whole slew of interesting fish, the chef just did it right. The rice was the right temperature, the fish was perfectly garnished, and it was just one of the best flavor rides I have enjoyed.As far as price is concerned, you can always expect to spend north of $100 on a meal like this, but considering the quality, it really wasn&#39;t too far north. The other places I have been in SF (Sakana and Sanraku) were both good, but I think Akiko&#39;s is the first place I have found in SF that I&#39;d consider a top 5 sushi experience.

Highly dissatisfied with the service and the sashimi tasting (12pc), multiple pieces were discolored and tasted terrible. I did order some decent nigiri, which is why this review is 2 stars as opposed to 1. The service was just as bad, maybe because 4 young adults dont have a lot of money? Even though our bill hit around $300. Our server was a male with long hair on the top and shaved sides, just a heads up if you end up getting him. We didnt even receive a thank you when leaving.....

Is it the Battle of the Akiko&#39;s? I keep picturing the competing chefs in ninja outfits having a mano-a-mano kendo stick match, probably on Claude Lane, in front of indifferent French diners I assume. Do they truly compete or is it more like the Battle of the Network Stars where they throw nerf balls at each other in a bouncy house? One Akiko is a modest, tight-fitting sushi bar on the lower part of Nob Hill on Mason. The other is this place, which is sleek, posh and also tiny. Or maybe the other place is the other place. Oh I don&#39;t know except this one does produce some mighty fine sashimi, sushi and nigiri, the standard delectables from my homeland. This is definitely not the Akiko&#39;s I remember from a decade back. No no, that one was a lot more like the other Akiko&#39;s.This one places a lot of focus on a beautifully immaculate presentation with exceeding freshness. For what was supposed to be a leisurely lunch with colleagues, I was blown away. We threw caution to the wind and let the chef perform his magic for us. It started with a polished, rustic-edged board upon which laid a half-dozen world-class trios of sashimi slices - Umimasu (Ocean Trout, $4.50), Hara Sake (Fresh Salmon, $6), Sunazuri (Yellowtail Belly, $6.60), Tenen Hirame (Fluke, $8.10), and Kodai (Red Snapper, $3.60), and Kuro Maguro (Pacific Bluefin Tuna, $9.60) (photo:bit.ly/1jchNtW). Simple and ocean fresh, devoured by us in a matter of minutes like it was Chicken of the Sea which would be ironic since Charlie was a tuna, wasn&#39;t he?Next came the sushi starting with the jewels in the crown rolled in nori - a pair of the mouth-popping Ikura (Wild Salmon Roe, $4) and a pair of the impossibly luscious Ankimo (Monkfish Liver, $4.25), which I&#39;ve gotten to know intimately at the must-go Ino Sushi (photo:bit.ly/1jJbrrT). The nigiri followed with a couple of Kuro Maguro (Chutoro) (Fatty Tuna, $10) and a couple of Kamasu (Barracuda, $6), a nice discovery for me and a new favorite (photo:bit.ly/1lHwrea). Arriving almost like a late-meal amuse bouche were two spoons of the Kan Kani (Crab, $5), perhaps the only slightly marginal taste of the bunch (photo:bit.ly/1jci6ow). But all was quickly forgiven at the end with the pair of Kuro Maguro (Otoro) (Tuna Belly, $12.50) (photo:bit.ly/1gVvG5F) and the pair of Managatsuo (Japanese Butterfish, $7.50) with dabs of liver on top (photo:bit.ly/1lHwyGK).We kept the libations to a minimum with a $13 glass of the Omachi Sake (photo:bit.ly/1nxND8G). Yes, it was quite steep for such a small amount, but it has a subtle flavor infused with rice, herbs and anise that made for a smooth ride down the gullet. The check did give us an audible gasp, a total of $116 for the three of us, and as you can see from the price tags above, we are talking about fish that runs quite a cost range. I assume the Fatty Tuna came in chauffeur-driven fish tanks. Alas, that is the price we pay for the quality. You can always go to the nearest sushi boat operation or maybe some franchise like Sushi-R-Us if you are balking at our bill. But if you treat yourself on those rare occasions and you&#39;re not in J-Town, then come here. But for Akiko&#39;s sake, make a reservation in advance. Drop-bys are near-impossible. Or go to the other Akiko&#39;s if you&#39;re that desperate.FOOD - 5 stars...world-class fish even if it is a lot of do-re-mi (...that&#39;s Japanese for &#34;I lost my wallet&#34;)AMBIANCE - 4.5 stars...small place but if you can get a table, you&#39;re in like bluefin (photo:bit.ly/1jB8eJB)SERVICE - 4.5 stars...very kind and serviceable wait staffTOTAL - 5 stars...best sushi in the FiDi...but make sure you&#39;re at the right Akiko&#39;s when you make that reservation

After duly booking 2 months in advance (this place was always full when we tried to go on the fly), my husband and I finally had an exquisite dinner at Akiko.The ambiance is a mix of modern and Japanese, with wood everywhere and very nice finishing. It puts you at ease as soon as you walk in: you&#39;re going to have an intimate atmosphere and privacy throughout the meal.We ordered the sashimi tasting menu, edamames and the egg roll, with a bottle of nigori sake. We were very satisfied with all of it. The sashimi tasting was amazing - almost as good as what we had in the Tokyo harbour! It amply accommodates 2, with a side like edamames. We were a little disappointed by the egg roll though - the rolls were too big and not as delicious. My husband really enjoyed the sake (he&#39;s the connaisseur here). Overall, a very good meal.The staff was courteous and not &#34;all over us&#34;, which I really appreciate. I would definitely recommend it, but remember to book in advance!

Tasty fresh sushi. We stopped in here on a whim trip to San Fran while awaiting a member of our family to fly into SFO. With no reservation our table of 4 was seated quickly for lunch. The miso soup was tasty. It was served without a spoon, so get ready to drink from the bowl in the traditional style. The rolls we had was good, as was the nigiri. Ultra-fresh fish was just what we needed.

Probably the best Japanese restaurant I&#39;ve been to. They serve the freshest sushi it&#39;s a party in your mouth. I can&#39;t remember much of the names of what we ate because it&#39;s all in Japanese, but I remember everything being so fresh and delicious. Ask your server what&#39;s fresh that day, and what he recommends and get that! It&#39;s really high quality and you&#39;ll taste the difference.My favorite is the uni with ankimo shavings on top. My top tip would be to ask your server what&#39;s fresh today.Also, good service in terms of attentiveness. However, you&#39;ll have to wait a while for York food, about 30 minutes. But the wait can&#39;t even persuade me to take off a star.

Am I in love ? Not quite. Perhaps it&#39;s b/c I&#39;m basing it on the standards set by Maido in Lima, Peru. Now that is awesome sushi. Akiko is good but not spectacular that I would &#39;die&#39; for it or have dreams about it. It is a small place, popular with the FIDI locals plus a few tourist. Tables are close together so you will hear ur neighbors conversation even if u don&#39;t want to. We tried a variation of rolls, sashimi, nigiri .. Nothing was bad, none was standout! Pricing is ok ..we spent about $170 for a party of 3 with no drinks.

Loooooove this place! Used to go here all the time when I lived in Nob Hill. The food is amazing, the staff friendly and atmosphere cozy. Good for a romantic dinner as well as dinner with friends. It is rather small so not good for large companies and always make sure to make reservations here, even for lunch.My favorite roll in the whole world is made here: The 49ers Roll. It is shrimp tempura roll with salmon and paper thin lemon on top plus some delicious mystery sauce. To die for! I need to go here every time I go back to visit San Fran to have that roll. I have never had a bad meal at this place and I have tried most things on their menu, so you really cannot go wrong no matter what you order.Plus for the art work on the walls.

Had the omakase here last night, but wow the service level here is horrible... Slowest service I&#39;ve experienced in months! For over 100 a person I expect to wait less than 25 minutes in between each dish... In fact, in between my meal the workers took sake shots... All in, I&#39;m pretty disappointed.Food wise everything was fresh and pretty solid. I recommend the wagyu + toro... And the uni.. Bomb..

First things first, if you drive past Akiko&#39;s, you WILL miss it. If you walk past Akiko&#39;s, most likely you WILL miss it again. It has a very small entrance and is right next to an alley and under some &#34;Irish Beer&#34; signage, which will make you think it&#39;s an Irish bar but it&#39;s not, its Akiko&#39;s. Long story short, there is no sign that calls out the name, so you are looking for the 431 number.People who know me know that I rarely go to the city without reservations, Akiko&#39;s was no exception. I&#39;m glad I made a reservation since I saw some people were turned down and they had to walk away (which serves them right, because they were thinking about taking our reservation :p, I hope they were happy with the whole foods sushi they got later).Akiko&#39;s is a very small establishment I must say, but it&#39;s very comfy. We asked the market price on Omakase that day and the server told us its $70-80 per person, I wasn&#39;t in a mood to spend that kind of money that night, so we went for a la carte. The hamachi kama at Akiko&#39;s is the best Hamachi kama I have ever had. The Hamachi was beyond fresh, you literally had to place it in your mouth and it would pretty much slide itself down your throat. The skin was nice and crispy. I would be dreaming of this Hamachi kama on a murky day. We also got the 6 piece nigiri tasting which was also very very fresh. The unagi, I must admit is not the best unagi, and you probably could do without. We decided to get two rolls, since we were very hungry and needed some heavy rice love but going forward I would be sticking to nigiri/sashimi. A place so good cannot be wasted on Americanized rolls. For the nigiri, hamach kama, two miso soups, unagi and two rolls, it cost us $67 before the tip. Next time, Omakase for me all the way!!

This restaurant has a the best sashimi I have ever had. Also the staff were really nice and they told me that the sushi is usually less than 3 days old when served. Along with the staff being very kind it also had speedy service, but when coming to your table they gave a five-star presentation to serve the hot sake. The exterior of the building isn&#39;t something to be proud of though, it&#39;s boring and doesn&#39;t have any sign at all. This has caused me to walk pass it a couple of times thinking it was part of another restaurant. When I figured out that it was in fact its own restaurant inside it had a very interesting atmosphere that I half liked; half was modern and the other was the original wall. The first time going there I was seated in the half of the room with the original wall which would have been cool if they put something over it to make it look less like an abandon castle. The second time every thing was nearly perfect with a modern atmosphere at the sushi bar.

Heard a lot of people raving about the sushi in San Fransisco so we decided to try it out for dinner. Akiko&#39;s was one of the first sushi restaurant I found on yelp and decided to go there. Tried calling a couple times to make a reservation but no one answered. Took us about 20 mins to find the restaurant because there were no sign on the front, just the street number which made it nearly impossible to find if you&#39;re not from the area. When we finally found it, the hostess was rude and pretentious. She told us that it was full and there were no more reservations available that night. Although we could be on a waitlist that was not a &#34;guarantee&#34; and would take an hour and a half to be notified. I put myself in the waiting list and asked how many people were ahead of me and she told me there were four. We took a stroll in downtown and the hostess from Akiko&#39;s called back under TEN MINUTES and told us there were seats available. Unbelievable. She could of simply told us &#34;yes or no&#34; there is a wait time...instead of leaving us discombobulated about the waitlist and no guaranteed seating. We came back to Akiko&#39;s and were seated in the back. The interior was nice with some industrial theme. The service was excellent overall besides the bitter incident earlier. The food was so-so nothing extraordinary. I would recommend the scallop sunomono, fresh scallop and ika.

A little bit disappointed with the quality and pricing. The FiDi location is extremely convenient but I expected more for the pricing for both the nigiri moriawase (6 pieces is hardly enough) and the kani-age (fried soft-shell crab). You could probably get similar quality a few blocks towards Union Square at better pricing.Wako still remains my favorite sushi in San Francisco proper (however it would be impossible to get there for lunch)

A tad heavy-handed on the wasabi, but overall our omakase meal at sushi bar was wonderful until it was time to pay. Who knew that our gentle reminder for the check would trigger World War III between the staff? Although the argument was not directed at us, we were put in an extremely uncomfortable situation and sprinted out of there as soon as we finished paying.I would love to return for another omakase experience but I&#39;m just so scurred!!!!

A very nice Japanese sushi located near chinatown and downtown. I saw the really good yelp reviews so I decided to come here. I think that it is a little overpriced for my taste, but the quality of the fish and the rolls make it worth it. The california rolls were made from real crab. But since I&#39;m not a sushi expert, I didn&#39;t think this was super outstanding.Pro:+ very nice interior+ excellent service+ fresh cuts of fish+ presentation was gorgeousCon:- small servings, only about 5-6 pieces per roll (I had to order 3 rolls, with each roll around 7 or 8 dollars)-beef teriyaki was a little hardTips+make reservations!

We ordered the omasake: the server ask what we like and somewhat tailored it to our liking. The quality of the food was on point but the service was just average.

The over priced sushi was good! But it was the inhospitable service that truly left a bad taste in my mouth. As we sat at our 2 hour reserved sushi bar seats, we were already being rushed out after the 45 minute mark. Our sushi chef looked at the manager at the end of the bar and dragged his finger across his neck, making a knife across the throat noise, indicating our party was finished or just not ordering fast enough. We decided &#34;slitting throat&#34; signs was not conducive to a happy meal and flopped out the door like fish out of water. Think twice before spending your paycheck here!

I know the story of Akiko&#39;s restaurant and I ate there 8 yrs ago.LAST NIGHT it was a MEMORABLE experience !I am a trained chef in Japanese cuisine and I eat Sushi all over The Bay.I tried 3 rolls and all three were amazing. The balance of flavors and the proportion was the closest to perfection. Until the last part of the bite went to my stomach, I could savor all the different elements. That is precious.I tried two different Hotate and both amazing. The one from Okkaido made me feel back in Tokyo years ago.California Uni excellent. Ikura had a very personal marinade.A White Fish was over priced.The 49rs blew my mind for the above mentioned reason = Best ever !!!

Perfect! Ask for omakase and sit at the sushi bar! You wont regret!I am amazed with every dish. They&#39;re pricer though, since they&#39;re made of only the best things. I am just crazy for all of them, especially the uni with crab fat on top roll!

I&#39;ve only tried their Sashimi and Sushi Omokaze. Unfortunately, sushi didn&#39;t meet the standard as the sushi rice wasn&#39;t done right. Sashimi was good but most Sushi joint in SF can do Sashimi pretty well if they can source good quality fish but if they can&#39;t get the rice done right, that dissipate the experience... maybe it was their bad-rice day. Perhaps I&#39;ll just need to stick to rolls and stuff next time if I do go back. The interior is pretty neat and trendy. Bar seating recommended.

Probably the best tasting avocado roll I have had outside of Nobu. It was so creamy and yummy. I can&#39;t even remember what else we had because I loved the roll so much I couldn&#39;t stop talking about it or thinking about it! It was a funky shaped restaurant. Good service. I would go back. I didn&#39;t give it 5 because the menu is weird and you couldn&#39;t just bring anyone there because it is a limited menu in my opinion.

What a little gem! As most Yelpers have stated already, Akiko&#39;s is a bit difficult to find....it&#39;s located next to an Irish Bar &amp; Restaurant. If you&#39;re walking down Bush St toward Kearny St, the only sign you&#39;ll get that lets you know you&#39;re at Akiko&#39;s is a gigantic fish painted on the side of the wall. LOOK FOR IT. And the Irish Bar sign.We weren&#39;t very hungry tonight--unfortunately--and one of us drove, so no drinks tonight! :( So we only ordered three specialty rolls: negihama, spider, and rainbow. I really wish we would have ordered sashimi!The service was really good, and the atmosphere is beautiful. I love the coziness of the area coupled with the dimly lit tables--a really nice spot for a date night! There&#39;s a nice bar area in the front--BUT IT&#39;S NOT A FULL BAR, so you can&#39;t order any type of cocktail. They have a great selection of wines and sake though, so you&#39;ll have plenty to choose from!FYI, there&#39;s another place called Akiko&#39;s Sushi Bar on Mason St...make sure if you&#39;re coming to Akiko&#39;s Restaurant that you look for it located on Bush St!I am DEFINITELY coming back here and getting the omakase and trying some of their sake next time. Can&#39;t wait until next time, Akiko!

Here&#39;s the thing, I eat a lot of sushi, it&#39;s my favorite food. And, there is some really great sushi at Akiko&#39;s so I hate to only give it 3 stars; however a friend and I ordered the omakse, which is basically a chef&#39;s selection which ended up being around $150. For that we got about 14 pieces of sushi (so 7 each). Additionally, they were brought out 2 pieces at a time with intervals almost 20 minutes... So again really good sushi, but that particular item was a long wait... Especially for the price, just my opinion.

Ate here the other day and was very disappointed! After waiting and waiting and finally getting a reservation at the very busy Akiko&#39;s, my boyfriend and I were so excited to go for dinner with our friend to celebrate his promotion!We got Omakase which was NOT traditional at all. We were seated at a table, not the sushi bar and we repeatedly saw the sushi chefs finish our nigiri but the wait staff leave it on the counter for 10 minutes or more. The service was very, very slow and inattentive. We were there for 2 hours!The fish, while fresh and seemingly good quality, was poorly prepared and the sushi was bland. It was prepared not by one chef, but assembly line style by multiple people. I&#39;ve never seen sushi prepared this way. It felt impersonal and cheap. And as I said, the sushi sat around for a while before reaching us, so the temperature of most of the pieces was off.We left Akiko&#39;s feeling cheated and worst of all, $350 later, we left still hungry.

Four of us came here for a work lunch. We shared the rainbow roll, 49er roll, veggie tempura, tofu, 24 pieces of sashimi, and two orders of uni negeri. The fish here is so fresh. We were all raving about how this is some of the best sushi that we&#39;ve ever tried. The services here is a bit slow, but the waiters do their jobs very well. The restaurant is pretty small so definitely make a reservation ahead of time.

SASHIMI Heaven!The restaurant is quietly located at the top of union square on bush st. The restaurant doesn&#39;t take walk in so reservations are required, which is great because there won&#39;t be any wait to have some fantastic sushi here.The restaurant appears small but there are table settings hidden away at the back. There is also bar seating available where the sushi chefs prepare their dishes.FOOD: We ended up having the chef provide an assorted 20 piece sashimi combo. The potions were fresh and melted in your mouth. My favorite pieces were definitely the salmon and tuna belly.Also if you want sake to drink, there is a brand called dewasasan. It&#39;s crisp sweet and refreshing.Overall, I&#39;ll be coming back next time to try the other dishes the restaurant orders.

Akiko has been on my list to try for quite some time now. Finally had the chance to go last week and it definitely did not disappoint!We didn&#39;t go for omakase this time since we heard it could take 2 hours, also we didn&#39;t sit at the bar to make the experience worthwhile.We ordered a bunch of nigiri including:KanpachiA5 Wagyu with truffle shavings: expensive, not sure if it was worh it.Chutoro (Otoro was out that night, sad)Normal nigi including salmon, barracudo etc...)Everything was really good, the nama uni though, was the best uni I&#39;ve ever had. My bf and I are not even uni lovers and we definitely loved the uni here! I can say now that I&#39;m a convert!For cooked dishes, we ordered the miso black cod, which is also the best black cod I&#39;ve ever had. My bf and I were fighting over the dish.The special of the night was bbq ribs (I know, a pretty weird choice for a sushi restaurant) but it was worth it.Overall, I would come back and try the omakase. This place is def one of the best sushi places in SF.

Great ambiance, good service, decent sushi, overpriced.We had the omakase (nigiri only) and it was OK. I didn&#39;t find the fish particularly fresh, and the rice was really dry.It&#39;s a great place for a date though and the waiters were attentive. Not sure I would go back though. Food quality is just too important to me for that price.

How have I not reviewed this place. There is absolutely no better sushi (nigiri) better in San Francisco.If you want rolls, go somewhere else, if you want cooked food, go somewhere else. If you want to spend good money, getting wonderfully put together Nigiri, come here.I&#39;ve eaten 6 or 7 times here now and this is what I can tell you:1) You must have a reservation. You can typically get one a couple days in advance, so it isn&#39;t the worst thing in the world, but you can not walk in2) Order Nigiri.3) If they have it then get: Umimasu (Ocean Trout), Wagyu Beef, and &#34;whatever else they have special that night.&#34;You do not need to add soy sauce to what they serve you, they&#39;ve made it to order as best it should be enjoyed.This place isn&#39;t cheap, but it is worth it.

Akiko&#39;s really hidden in plain sight and the hardest place to find since they literally have no store sign. The best way to find it is to look for the building with a &#34;Irish Bar&#34; sign. That&#39;s where Akiko is and the sign is really misleading. The decor of this place is not really a Japanese restaurant either which makes it hard to guess what it is looking from the outside in. It&#39;s kind of a hip trendy looking place from the feeling it gives off.== Food ==Tonkatsu with rice. The tonkatsu was really really well done. Nicely crispy on the outside with very soft pork on the inside. The rice was not your average cheapo white rice either.Tuna sashimi was really fresh and amazing. I can literally taste the freshness of it.== Service ==Service is really good. The place has a business dining luncheon like to it.== Overall ==Really expensive but the quality is definitely on par with the price. There&#39;s a lot of business people here, which makes me suspect they cater toward that crowd. This place is either a treat yourself or a great place to have a business lunch.

I went twice to this restaurant. The first time I had a 3-4 star experience. The second time, however, I did not. Here is what happened.I had a 6:30 dinner reservation for a party of 1 on a Saturday. I arrived promptly to the restaurant and checked in with the hostess. She checked me in and lead me to the bar. I looked at the bar stool and it did not have a back support. I told the hostess that I have a back problem and the bar stool will not provide me w/ the needed support. She said that tables are reserved for parties of 2, even though I was seated before at a table w/o asking, and that they are fully booked and that she will try to find a table.Scanning around a restaurant, I could see that they had 3 open 2-tops and 2 open 4-tops along w/ 2 open bar stools.She got back to me and said that if I want a table, I have to wait, and that my seating will be limited to an hour. I told her that I was planning to have the omakase and that an hour is not enough. She said that I have to set at the bar if I am to get the omakase.She made me feel that my reservation was less valuable than other reservations. I was about to spend $150+ and I was not about to risk back pain for that. I told the hostess that I was not about to risk getting back pain and left.

I&#39;ve been here a few times, and I&#39;ve always left here satisfied with the taste of deliciously FRESH sushi. My only issue is with the service at times. A co-worker and I came here after making reservations earlier that day, and when we entered the hostess made us wait for nearly 30 minutes to sit at the sushi bar because our reservations were made only that day and there was another party expected to come who made reservations way in advance(does that matter?), and the other side of the sushi bar was off limits because the sushi chef was new.. Turns out that &#34;special&#34; party never came, and shortly after we were seated the hostess allowed another party to sit in those exact seats. Lame.Pretentiousness aside, we ordered some sake to celebrate the fact that it was Friday and we were about to get our sushi on. The chef was friendly, helpful and informative on the different types of sushi they had available that day. We would&#39;ve kept eating if it wasn&#39;t for our bellies being full. The bill was about $70 each, but given we had the drinks along with a lot of the specials it didn&#39;t feel overpriced. I&#39;d say 5 stars (6 really) for the sushi and 1 star for the hostess. Not going to knock the entire restaurant down for her attitude, but only because the food more than made up for it.

Akiko&#39;s Restaurant is by far the best sushi restaurant I have been to in a long time and is now my go to sushi place. The decor, ambiance, quality of the fish, skill of the chefs and professionalism/politeness of the owner and staff is astounding. Never have I been to a sushi place that serves fish of this quality and, on occasion, special rare types of fish.Every bit of fish they serve is so soft, fresh and has so much flavor. Not only do they serve incredibly high quality fish but, if you&#39;re lucky, you may find yourself there on a night when they have certain rare items on the menu such as the Russian Uni and the Keiji Salmon. I have never been an Uni eater but Akiko&#39;s turned me around. Their Russian Uni, and even their other types which they have frequently are so creamy and tasty that anyone could love it. One night there I asked the chef for a creative dish using Uni. I was given a Uni nigiri with salmon roe, a quail egg yolk and grated ankimo on top, absolutely amazing.Another favorite of mine was the Keiji Salmon, a $140/lb fish that is found in about 1 out of every 10,000 salmon that is caught and has a higher fat content than toro! I had a few pieces of this and they also fried up the head for me. Definitely the best salmon I have ever eaten and quite possibly the best fish in general. It was so amazingly soft with so much flavor, I barely even had to chew it. It was so good that I even came back the very next night for another round.One final thing you can always find there and is a must have is the A5 BMS10+ wagyu beef covered in sliced and shaved fresh truffle. A seared piece of only the highest grade beef covered with truffle slices and a mountain of shaved fresh truffle. Usually the last course you will have if you put yourself in the chefs hands and is absolutely incredible, and who doesn&#39;t like truffle?!?!Akiko&#39;s is an amazing restaurant, one of the few where I am continually astounded every time I come, my only complaint is that they have completely ruined my palate and as such I am no longer interested in any of the other sushi places I use to frequent. Their quality of fish, amazing staff and skilled chefs (especially Ricky) makes this restaurant an incredible place to be. For the best experience, sit at the bar and put yourself entirely in the chefs hands, you will not be disappointed (unlike some other reviewers below me leaving 2 and 3 star reviews when all they ordered was a rainbow roll and some shrimp tempura), even when the bill comes at the end, if anything you&#39;ll just walk out wanting to come right back!

I&#39;ve been to Akiko&#39;s quite a few times and for the most part have always enjoyed it. Went for my birthday with my mother and had a great time. This one star review is regarding the new hostess with bleached light blue-ish hair. I went with a friend for lunch and was told there would be a wait (I totally understand, they are very popular and therefore very busy). She said there would be a table in half an hour so we went walking around. Came back after 25 minutes and when we approached her, the same hostess just stared at us with a look that implied &#34;why are you bothering me?&#34; I thought it was obvious that we came back to check on the status of any available tables, but since she just stared at us and didn&#39;t say anything, I felt the need to explain myself. I said, &#34;oh... we&#39;re just here because you asked us to come back in 30 minutes&#34; She kept staring and eventually said &#34;I still don&#39;t have a table for you.&#34; So then I asked, &#34;will it be more than fifteen minutes?&#34; and she said yes firmly. I&#39;m not sure if she understands the role of a hostess (I&#39;ve worked every role in the FOH of many restaurants, so there&#39;s no excuse that I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m talking about) but part of her job is to make guests feel comfortable, not like they&#39;re bothering you with their presence. Please don&#39;t take for granted that I would like to spend my money at your place... for that reason, I would like to be treated with some courtesy. I would like to apologize in advance because I know it&#39;s unfair to let this one experience with a rude (and obviously inexperienced) hostess define my feelings towards Akiko&#39;s, and to assure the business that this is not the case. I certainly will return and I will update this review based on any positive future experiences I have there.

OMG. The sushi and sashimi are out of this world! The fish is so fresh (even though the sushi pieces are a bit small) and worth every penny of $7-$20/order (comes with 2 pieces per order)!!!The staff is very helpful with the selection and friendly. The sushi does take a long time to come out though...but I attribute it to the sushi gurus putting extra love into each piece. I especially loved the kani (trust me on this), the seared salmon and the hotate (scallop).For the cooked foods, I loved the hamachi kama and fried ika. YUM!The hubs really enjoyed the amaebi, but he said the uni wasn&#39;t the freshest he&#39;s had. I don&#39;t eat either one, so can&#39;t help you there...The place is really small, so make a reservation and come hungry!

Dear Akiko,I gave you a chance by going out of our usual spot at Zushi Puzzle on my lovely bf&#39;s birthday. I even cancelled the sushi bar reservation at Zushi just because a friend recommended you to me. I asked you for 2 things: please beat Zushi Puzzle omakase, impress me! (in writing) and asked for a little something small with a candle for his birthday on the phone. And you said yes! Guess what? You failed both miserablyIn details: The food was good but not exceptional. It was much more expensive compared to the other $$$ sushi place... surprisingly when you only have $$ sign on Yelp. Or maybe you think it&#39;s okay to put whichever price on for omakase. I was honestly so upset that there was not even a little mochi ice cream with the candle at the end when the bill came out to be over $400 that all the little good things you present over the omakase meal was technically gone. And I couldn&#39;t ask for it since it would just be an awkward situation. Even at Zushi Puzzle, a strange guest who pays that much would at least have a spoon of strawberry sorbet just so you know, Akiko!So 1 star for your waiter and another for your food!Your sincerely!

You still have to wait even though you have reservations unless prior parties leave early.I did not drive here so I don&#39;t know too much about how parking is but there is parking lots everywhere near by as well as street parking (metered).Ambiance is noisy as if in a lounge. Even if you and a friend or significant sits across from each other, expect to lean forward a lot to hear one another.Also if you have asthma like myself. While sitting inside to eat (very very narrow room). Its hard to breathe. No air circulation and candles makes it that much harder.Waiting area is very tiny, its technically not even a waiting area. So if they are busy, expect to wait outside. Waiting inside means you are cramped in the center between a bar, a few tables and the door. Once those table food comes out, you will be moving to your right/left often to get out their way.Food: it was good! Will I come back again? Honestly its 50/50. The salmon sashimi was delicious. That would be the only reason why I&#39;d come back. Even than...I would most likely just do an order to go. Not worth to wait another 30-45 min after my reservation time just to be seated.

This is an over-do review from 2014.Given the great reviews, I was excited to try their omakase with my fiance.We sat at the bar for omakase. If I sit at the bar for omakase, I&#39;m expecting the whole sushi experience - and yet I noticed the chef was not explaining what each fish/dish. When I asked what a particular fish was called, he paused and couldn&#39;t answer. Silence. Awkward and completely unprofessional. He also let a few of the pieces fall to the side after he placed them on our plate (...maybe he was new!?) Sounded like most of the chefs had great culinary experience but no deep sushi specific training...Fish was decently fresh but this spot isn&#39;t a top tier sushi restaurant that can warrant $100+ pp for omakase. I most certainly prefer Kiss Seafood, Saru or pay a bit more and go to Maruya.

I really love the atmosphere, very low key but a quite comfortable setting. The waiters are very nice as well.Fish is superb here. We tried amaebi, scallop, uni, unagi, sweet fish, etc. All of them are fresh and the rice is in the right portion. Their yakimono beef is phenomenal, juicy and tender. A must try!Would definitely want to come back for a third time! Tip: make reservation ahead!

Had reservations and was seated promptly at the reserved time. Great service. Zero complaints with the hostess and the waiter I had.Food wise. Omakase was amazing.Most notably: The uni was out of this world and that A5 wagyu was the bomb diggityyyy!! Uni was fresh and had a huge burst of flavor. The wagyu was buttery and melts in your mouthhhhh. Amazing.

I was looking for a place to get sushi for lunch, and Akiko&#39;s was recommended at the salon I was at. It was a bit hard to find with so much construction around, but I didn&#39;t give up! And I am glad I didn&#39;t.It was busy during the lunch rush, but since I was on my own I was seated pretty quickly. I had the spicy tuna roll and green iced tea - both were good, and I was so happy to have sushi again.Fun find!

TL;DR:Pros: Good foodCons: terrible/ ssssslllllllooooooowwwwwww/ inefficient serviceIf this were a review based solely on the taste of the food, I&#39;d give it a 4. But the service is so terrible that there&#39;s no way Akiko&#39;s is anywhere near multiple stars. They have a long way to go and a lot of inefficiencies that need to be addressed.We came here on a Thursday night with reservations. I noticed some people being turned away because they didn&#39;t have reservations. I also noticed that people were waiting in line when 2-3 tables were open just because they were reserved by people late for their reservations. Inefficiencies abound; they had maybe 4 bus-boys but only one guy taking real orders.It took 30 minutes to finally get a waiter to come to us; we asked 3 different bus-boys to place or order but they all said they weren&#39;t waiters and that they&#39;d call over the waiter. The one waiter would walk by avoiding eye contact and go to another table each time we tried waving him down.We ordered some entrees and some sushi, but sashimi took forever to come out; in fact our order of uni took 1 hour and 30 minutes. We asked the waiter once, and the bus-boys twice for our order of uni. Later on the receipt we were double counted for our uni.We ordered two volcano rolls, one with fake crab and the other without; we explained that our friend was allergic to crab and didn&#39;t want to risk it (even if it was fake crab). The first volcano roll came out in 15 minutes, the second took an hour. When the &#34;crabless&#34; one came, it was the same as our volcano roll only they sprinkled the crab on top rather than frying it in. We explained that we didn&#39;t want to risk the crab-allergy but the waiter simply said &#34;it&#39;s just fake crab don&#39;t worry eat at and you&#39;ll see.&#34; Sure it ended up being fine, but there was no need for it to be sprinkled on top (when it&#39;s usually fried into the volcano roll toppings).They offered the roll on the house, but they put a random $15 dollar roll we didn&#39;t order on our bill anyways. We didn&#39;t check our bill close enough; we caught the double order of uni mistake but we didn&#39;t catch that they included a random roll into our bill.The dining experience was from 7pm to 9:30pm. Most of that time was us trying to catch a waiters attention, being avoided by bus-boys who knew they couldn&#39;t help us, and waiting for our single order of uni and crab-sprinkled volcano roll.Extremely disappointed because what&#39;s the use of good food when the service is horrendous and the wait time is a few hours for fish to be sliced.

Some of the freshest sushi I&#39;ve had. Well seasoned and unique in flavor. I ordered a rainbow roll and miso soup. Delish!Side note, the bathrooms were spotless and the restaurant had great ambiance. Easy to miss when walking by though as the restaurant is unmarked, but I personally thought this added to the &#34;cool&#34; factor.

Best sushi in SF in my opinion! Their stuff are soooo fresh... The sake nigiri is just blowing... The wait is pretty long, so we always make reservations. You can find a perfect time and day when you want to come if you book 2-3 weeks in advance. They have walk ins too, but since the place isnt big, the wait might be long on the weekend. Great date night spot! They have big variety of fish and they are all really good! The service is always great there and mochinice cream was great too. Its on the pricey side, but definitely worth the price, since quality is high!

Absolutely rudest hostess (Elise) I&#39;ve ever met. Told her I was looking for a friend and she refused to let me just peek into the back of the restaurant. After recommending an out of town friend to go here, I will never step foot in the restaurant or tell anyone to come here. Just because you&#39;re working for a popular restaurant doesn&#39;t mean you get to be a complete B and rude.

Make sure you come to Akiko&#39;s Restaurant, NOT Akiko&#39;s Sushi Bar (auto result for &#34;Akiko&#39;s&#34; on Google Maps). You should make a reservation; they aren&#39;t always able to accommodate walk-ins or have long wait times (over 1 hour).Akiko&#39;s is on SF Chronicle&#39;s Top 100 Restaurants, so you know that this is some quality food. The menu looks like a standard Americanized Japanese restaurant (specialty rolls, nigiri, set dinners, etc), but the individual items tend to be more tapas-sized.- Negi Toro (MP, $15 that night): 5 pieces, with tuna belly/toro, scallion, pickled daikon, sesame. This is the best toro I&#39;ve had; the fish is so tender and melts in your mouth. The additional flavors complement the fish without overpowering.- Negihama ($10): 5 pieces, with yellowtail, scallion, shiso, sesame. Yellow tail is my go-to sashimi option because it&#39;s hard to mess up an inherently high quality fish. Akiko&#39;s does no wrong with this roll.- Beef Nakimono ($13): We ordered the Hamachi Kama, but they had run out for the night (it was only 7PM!), so the waiter suggested we get the beef instead. The Niman Ranch beef is cooked medium and arranged in a tetris-fashion with Japanese pumpkin and carrots. I usually do not enjoy teriyaki-ed meat, but I was impressed by the beef quality. We ordered this after finishing our rolls and it took 20 minutes to come out, so order up front to avoid the wait.I shared these three dishes with my friend, and we both felt that it was a light dinner. We probably should have ordered 2 more dishes to eat our fill, so I would probably tip Akiko&#39;s to a $$$ restaurant, rather than $$. The quality is worth the price tag, especially on the fish.

I work in FiDi and I tend to stay late at work. I always hear good things about this place and wanted to give it a try tonight.&#34;We don&#39;t do take-out.&#34; That was the response I got from the waitress. After giving me a mean look, she took the menu from my hands and walked away. Excellent first impression and you lose a customer forever.

One of my favorite sushi spots and that&#39;s saying a lot because I love me some sushi. It says $$ but it is definitely on the border of $$$. My average bill there is $160 for four people. Although I do tend to order the toro bellies. All in all, it is a nice restaurant with really fresh sushi.

Love the atmosphere! Very petty decor and wall paper is really cool! It&#39;s a very very small restaurant and there&#39;s no sign outside of restaurant. We had hard time finding it first. You definitely need the reservation here. Fish is very fresh, but I would love to have more variety of choice of sushi and sashimi. It&#39;s a little limited for me. Great service and I would go back again when I go to San Francisco!

Had another wonderful experience on 5/22 for dinner--a double date night with our foodie BFFs. We had omakase, which didn&#39;t disappoint. We loved the selection of cold, hot, sashimi and nigiri.Bill was appx $350 per couple (included a couple of rounds of sake), tax and tip. We weren&#39;t surprised by this as we know how omakase pricing works.Our server, Ryan, was great! So personable, knowledgeable and attentive.

This place screams snooty-patooties for the SF Financial District from the lack of signage, unwelcoming seat staff for those that look &#34;unworthy&#34;, and pricey food.For a meal that cost $80, I&#39;d at least want to be satisfied and full. My date and I tried two sashimi dishes and a roll and were sadly disappointed.The alleged &#34;sashimi flown in last night&#34; wasn&#39;t that spectacular.Also, the 49er roll tasted only a tad better than a $10 roll at joe-schmo Japanese restaurant.Bottom-line: if you&#39;re a posh SF food connoisseur that likes to throw money at places, they require reservations.

Came for a late lunch while visiting and was able to get a table without a reservation given that we would not take over an hour. I heard it was a little hard to get a table here so I guess we just lucked out.The selection was pretty decent and fresh, although not exceptionally so. I enjoyed the ankimo and umimasu, but otherwise wasn&#39;t blown away as far as sushi experiences go (especially at that price point).

The first three pieces might have tasted good because I was starving.If it was a blind taste test Id think I was tasting samples to a boba cafe. It was just Plain gooey.Yellow tail: grass jellyTuna : black bobaSalmon : popping bobaYou get it.Leave it to the Fi Di to overcharge for poor quality food once again!One star for attentive staff.

This is a short and quick review to provide my 4 star rating.Decor: nice and modern.Staff: fun and friendlyFood: a very nice menu selection. Quality of food was very good. No complaints. The Wagyu beef with shaved truffle was delicious and my most memorable dish thereService: quick and on pointGet Reservations..come early. We were the first customers when they opened...sat sushi bar as always...ordered everything my stomach and eyes wanted at the time.Overall, no complaints. Akiko serves good food with a friendly smile. But for me, it was missing something...maybe a down to earth and not so swanky vibe? Iono...something...for some reason i can&#39;t really put a finger on it. I just know that I don&#39;t really care to come back. I came, I saw, I ate, and it was cool. My typical re.visits in the bay are ichi, sushi ran &amp; sushi sams...I think of themmmm when my mouth craves for sushi... :) Akiko is just not in my thoughts.I do recommend this place though as I am confident they will not disappoint

This place ticks all the right boxes for me - relaxing decor and quiet dining experience, service that is good but not overbearing, and food that is amazing. And good sized portions!My recommendations:Scallop and shrimp gyoza - very unique, tastes amazing, and just the right crispy skin on one side. Plus, it&#39;s a bargain... Six gyozas for $6!!Rainbow roll - just heaven with soft shell crab inside and slices of fresh fish on top. It has a bit of a spicy kick too, so if you&#39;re afraid of spice do let them know when you order.Yellowtail roll - at $5 for the whole roll, this is am amazing bargain. Doesn&#39;t taste as good as the rainbow roll, but at this price it doesn&#39;t matter.Will definitely be returning here again when next in SF!

I ordered 2 rolls. The Sake roll with salmon and the Tekka roll with fresh tuna. The fish was absolutely divine. Very fresh and they ratio of fish to rice in the roll was decent. The actual size of each rolls were smaller then anticipated, leaving me hungry for more. The place is a bit pricey, so expect to drop around $30 each person for a meal if you&#39;re really hungry. The sake had huge chunks of salmon that was the best tasting and freshest I&#39;ve ever eaten. The Tekka roll highlight was the crunchy component that added to the chunks of tuna. Due to the small portion and high price ( and the fact that I&#39;m not rollin&#39; in dough) I will not come here again. If you can afford it go ahead and blow a couple bills on this place!

Tried this restaurant with a friend tonight. I really wanted to love this restaurant! I wanted to so badly that we got the $100/person omakase.The sashimi was really good...good start, the uni was amazing! and the ikura was also a great surprise! I normally don&#39;t even like ikura that much but the ones here were yummy. Finally, they brought out a plate of 7 pieces of different nigiri. They were all decently good, but nothing really stood out to me.Then, the biggest surprise came... Our server told us that was the end of our meal when I thought we were in the middle =( For $100, I expected so much more. If you have $100 to waste, by all means get the omakase, it was pretty yummy. But I would probably recommend ordering a la carte. We probably should&#39;ve done that. I probably would&#39;ve given akiko 4-5 stars if I had ordered a la carte. I thought the omakase was wayyy too over priced. and not really that much better than other sushi places in the city.

Truly delicious. Their sashimis, nigiris, and sushi rolls are to die for. Their tuna and salmon are so fresh that they melt on the tongue. This is the restaurant where I had the best Japanese food so far in my life. The price is definitely not $$ however: it&#39;s more like $$$$. Count about $100 a dinner per person with sake and a large sample of their delicacies. Also, the restaurant is pretty small and you have to reserve long in advance. It&#39;s worth it. The waiter we had was particularly helpful and friendly, and contributed to a great experience. There is no name on the restaurant&#39;s door, and it&#39;s next to an Irish pub with a prominent sign. So finding Akiko was slighlty challenging.

I truly wanted to fall in love with this place, since most of the reviews were so good! Also the pictures looked amazing. But sadly I was EXTREMELY disappointed with the food and service.My boyfriend made reservations for my birthday while we were in SF, he put in as a note that it was my birthday. (Nothing special was done, so just a little pointer for everyone, don&#39;t waste your time writing in the little comment box, they don&#39;t pay attention)The food: HORRIBLE!!!! If I had to choose between Akikos and take out sushi shops, I would so choose the take out sushi shop. The quality of the fish was hard to swallow, literally I was having the hardest time, The sake was the only thing helping me to swallow the horrible food.The service, nothing to do with our server, he was very nice. But I think just how long it took them to bring out the food was horrible... I know we ordered the omakase but it was VERY long for each dish to come out (way too long for a birthday girl to wait) and as the minutes went by I felt sicker and sicker from the food.I really did want to like this restaurant so much. But for the quality and the price we paid. Heck no. We def got ripped off. I would never come back and pay $300 plus for their omakase again!Never again going to Akikos......Unless I wanna throw up.

Came here on a Saturday night and the place wasn&#39;t hard to find, it just didn&#39;t have a sign. Just remember it&#39;s at the corner!Anyhow, the omakase was amazing! The ingredients were fresh, as the fishes get shipped to the store twice weekly. I really enjoy the Russian Uni and the Imperial Shrimp, which is more unique and uncommon in most regular sushi restaurants. The uni was not briney at all and the texture of the shrimp was very tender (since it was killed before it was served..ahh). I also really like the Passion Fruit Saketini, very fruity yet such a creeper.The hostess and the waiter were amazing and helpful. There was a homeless that was bugging my boyfriend and I at the window; and the hostess being very petite, decided to walk out and waved him away. Very brave of her! The waiter was great at recommending food portions and drink suggestions. He also check on us and make sure we are doing well.Yum, would love to go back any time any day! Just remember to make reservation!

Great ambiance, courteous and helpful staff, take reservations.We got the omakase and really loved the sashimi. However we also felt they seared too many of the other nigiri pieces. Don&#39;t get me wrong- everything we had was wonderful and there was no part of the omakase that I didn&#39;t like- we just preferred their lightly seasoned nigiri over their seared pieces. Their rice is also very unique and it just wasn&#39;t what we were looking for. Overall, they had an amazing selection of fish both from Japan and elsewhere and they pay attention to all the right details. I&#39;d probably go back for their sashimi and more traditional nigiri, but don&#39;t think I&#39;d splurge again for the omakase.

The worst part was that I told her ok, we will be back, and asked if can I use the restroom. She didn&#39;t let us use the restroom because we weren&#39;t sitting in a table yet, and not even that my friend was pregnant.That was so rude !!Even though, I love the place, I won&#39;t be back there.

Food quality was on average OK. The rice for the nigirizushi was not at the appropriate temperature or stickiness. Specifically, it was too cold and too crumbly.After placing my order, I was informed that the restaurant was out of both Amaebi and Uni. However, the same server who informed me of the lack of amaebi set down a pair of nigiri and announced it as &#34;Amaebi.&#34; It was not amaebi, but some other set of shrimp pieces. Curiously, I later saw a set of proper amaebi prepared.Later in the evening, I heard an order placed by a server for uni. Additionally, I overheard my server asking a colleague to make sure a certain couple left the restaurant soon, because, &#34;they had been there too long&#34;.The workers behind the counter were incredibly disorganized, made several errors with getting orders correct, and in general, lacked professionalism in their conduct.Sushi is one of my favorite things, and the quality of the food and the staff at Akiko&#39;s Restaurant is subpar.

This place has decent sushi but the quality is not consistent which is disappointing. On our recent visit we recommended omakase to a friend who was eating there for the first time and they served all ten pieces(all nigiri too) at once, and not very good selection of fish nor direction to eat(which one needs to be consumed first and how to clean your palate in between) I wanted to pretend that never happened...

After booking a table for four a week in advance and from the Yelp reviews, my friends and I had high expectations. However, I was warned that Akiko&#39;s Restaurant is pretty much popular for its location -- not its sushi. It was a little too late to cancel, so we decided to try it anyways.When we arrived, the atmosphere was confusing. You could tell that they&#39;re trying to make it feel sophisticated with the candles and interior decor, but it was a cramped and crowded space. Not exactly a place I would have thought to book well in advance.We were left to explore the menus on our own, which had a limited selection at quite the high price. The four of us decided to get a bit of everything to share. I ordered a nigiri duo (with teriyaki beef) and a wakame salad. My friends ordered salmon teriyaki, saba, fried squid, and a few rolls.The wakame salad was good, if just a bit salty. The assorted nigiri and saba tasted very good. However, the cuts for the nigiri were inconsistent. They should not have served a nigiri with a brokenly cut piece of akami. The salmon teriyaki was good, and the beef teriyaki was even better! Very tender and soft. The rolls were average. The 49er was actually terrible because adding too much lemon completely covered the taste of anything else in the roll. Despite having a decent slice of salmon, I could taste nothing but lemon. The fried squid was average too. We found the food overpriced for the quality. Sure, the quality of the fish is great, but good ingredients do not always make for good food.Service was just bad. We kept getting food we didn&#39;t order brought to our table. They weren&#39;t able to read our confused faces either. We had to explain to them that some foods aren&#39;t ours. Two of our orders never came, so we had to ask about them. Perhaps they got taken to another table! After that, we mistakenly received a duplicate and after table&#39;s order. Get it together, Akiko.When the fried squid finally showed up, the waiter apologized for the wait and said that because of it, this dish was on the house. That&#39;s nice. Then maybe ten minutes later, a roll finally shows up after waiting forever and they didn&#39;t put that on the house. It was the same waiter too! I wonder if he thought that to be odd -- not putting the even later order on the house.By the end of the meal at Akiko&#39;s Restaurant, we were all undoubtedly disappointed. They were right -- the pricy food tastes average, but is in a good location.

Definitely a good spot for sushi in San Francisco!! It is located next to the Irish pub! When I was there, no sign was in front if the restaurant, so I almost missed it. This place is quite popular with a wide selection of local fish to impaired fish from Japan. Therefore I would recommend any potential visitors to make a reservation! My personal recommendation is the Wagyu Beef sushi!!

As I sit here hoping the frequent bathroom trips will stop after being in agony for hours now, I curse myself for not walking out during the meal.I am allergic to avocado. It&#39;s one of those allergies that most people can&#39;t believe but it&#39;s true. My bodily reaction to having avocado is one I wish no one would have to suffer....except maybe my worst enemy.We were enjoying our omakase when I noticed avocado on the bar. It wasn&#39;t that much cause for alarm, at first, until a couple dishes later.My bf had gotten the attention of the chef and said we can&#39;t eat that - I&#39;m allergic - to which the chef smiled and nodded assuring us it was for the roll.I noticed, one dish later, my tongue started to tingle and my throat felt a little tighter and then the tell-tale stomach pain started creeping on. As I looked at the bar, I saw what the chef was doing. There he was scooping out the avocado and wiping the spoon on the same towel that he used to wipe his hands, the blade, and the board he was using - repeatedly. He would do this with more rolls and I was mortified.If someone tells you they have an allergy - be respectful. Maybe have someone else (there were 2 other chefs) handle the rolls or get a clean towel. Do not use the same tools that can contaminate the food.I&#39;m sticking to Maruya - it&#39;s far superior - and it is roll and avocado free.

Despite the evident popularity of their Volcano Roll, this isn&#39;t where you go to get mayo-laden, fried, sauce-heavy maki rolls. Sitting at the sushi bar, I quickly discovered that they have been moving away from this Americanized version of the Japanese cuisine toward simply showcasing amazing fish.While I can appreciate what we&#39;ve done with sushi in this country (when it&#39;s done well), sometimes you just need something clean and simple. And after a week of binging on pork, all I wanted was that. The mixed green salad and the 6-piece nigiri tasting couldn&#39;t have been better for the situation.The salad is light, and fresh, with cucumbers adding a bit of texture. The avocado is well-seasoned, and the soy-ginger dressing delicious enough that I want the recipe.The nigiri was nearly impeccable; generous portions of buttery, clean fish, it was the absolute antithesis of everything I&#39;d been consuming for the past week...and yet, just as delicious.I left thoroughly satisfied, and only having embarrassed myself with fish hanging out of my mouth once.

Nice ambiance, service was ok but the food was not. Uni was good but it seemed that every roll had the same sweet sauce drizzled over it so it all tasted the same. I was still hungry but could not bring myself to order more food as it would be a waste of money. I will stick to traditional sushi bars and avoid the hoidy toidy sushi joints. This review should account for two as my lunch date feels the same way. Oh and one last think, who puts daikon in Tekka Maki??

I loved the energy of Akiko from the moment I walked through the door. It&#39;s a tiny spot so be sure to make a reservation unless you want to sit at the bar.We were a group of 5 and were seated immediately. We ordered some edamame and shishito peppers for the table. I ordered the volcano roll but asked for it without salmon skin and they were very happy to accommodate (yay for restaurants that accommodate!).The volcano roll was awesome! It came in a big bowl and was covered in the most delicious tempura flakes! Spicy salmon was wrapped with avocado, scallion and toasted sesame.They are not getting 5 stars because our waiter was a little brusque and service a little slow. But overall a great meal and I would definitely return!

I come to Akiko&#39;s whenever I get major sushi cravings. (Remember, when making reservations make sure it is Akiko&#39;s on BUSH street, not Akiko&#39;s sushi bar on Mason... !! )This place is the Sh*t. If you want good, sophisticated sushi, there is no better place in the city than Akiko&#39;s.They do sushi right, and they also have their own style. Chef Ricky and his team are constantly experimenting and coming up with innovative styles of sushi making, they also do really creative a la carte dishes.The atmosphere is never tense like traditional sushi restaurants. I like Akiko&#39;s more than most sushi joints because the last thing I want to feel to be TENSE. No phones no photography no loud laughters kinda place... = not for me.My most recent visit on my friends birthday was absolutely mind blowing. Chef Ricky and his team went above and beyond to make my bestie&#39;s sushi dinner feast an incredibly memorable one.This is without a doubt my favorite sushi place in the city. Come spend your money here at the sushi bar and I promise you, you will not regret it.

We ordered 2 orders of omakase and was very disappointed. Although the fish was very fresh, all 15 pieces was brushed with the same house special soy sauce. There was no creativity in their omakase considering we paid $100 pp. it all ended up tasting the same. I definitely don&#39;t recommend the omakase if you come here.

Cute place that looks small, but actually has a hidden back room that fits way more than you&#39;d think! For noon though, it still gets pretty packed, so if you&#39;re looking for a lunch spot, I&#39;d still recommend reservations, which I did, smartly!The trip was all worth it for one of the most delicious sushi rolls I&#39;ve ever had! I&#39;ll even forgive the name... the Forty Niner - shrimp, salmon and lemon. It was incredible. And the reason was the lemon. It gave it this burst of flavor that was incredible. It really blew all the other rolls away. If it was called the Steeler Roll, maybe it would have been even better... Okay, I lied. It couldn&#39;t. It rocked my world!I wish I could tell you the other rolls, but since the Forty Niner blew me away, I don&#39;t remember! Even at $16. But that&#39;s probably a steal in SF, right?!

This place is a hole in a wall. You can&#39;t really find them because they don&#39;t have the name. This place is just a small sushi and bar style kind of restaurant near Chinatown in San Francisco. The atmosphere is cozy and relaxing. The staffs weren&#39;t really attentive. I needed to ask them for drinks and when I wanted to order food again. I ordered dragon rolls. Don&#39;t get me wrong, what I had was just fine. The presentation and the taste just failed. A little pricey too. Tourist trap kind of restaurant.

The freshest fish I had. I will never forget the taste of that uni in my mouth. It was so...flavorful and amazing.My sister took me here for my birthday for dinner. I was blown away by the way the sushi was served and how pretty everything looked (ITS LIKE ART). Overall, there is a good selection of different kinds of sushi and fishes. However, don&#39;t come here for a cheap and filling meal.Towards the end, my sister and I were still hungry after eating our sushi dishes so we needed to order another bowl of udon to fill us up (sad I know)...FYI: You can always tell if a sushi place is legit if the uni is on point. THIS UNI HERE WAS ON POINT. Come here for legit sushi--legit meaning like &#34;I probably can&#39;t go to Japan anytime soon so this is as good as it gets.&#34;

(from 8/26/2013)The best sushi I&#39;ve ever had. Admittedly, I&#39;m from the Midwest, where great sushi is hard to come by.After two visits here, the staff was overall better the second time around. They were pretty on the spot (no less than 5 people came by at regular intervals to check on us). One of our beers arrived a little tardy, which wasn&#39;t that big of a deal but one of the staff seemed distressed about that and didn&#39;t charge for it.Cool setting, all-around great experience. Foresee going here every time I&#39;m in SF.

I discovered this place after a co-worker highly recommend it. The exterior is not much to look at but once you get inside you will find a beautifully appointed restaurant. It&#39;s not very big so I &#34;highly&#34; recommend reservations. Everything I tried was fantastic. The quality of the fish was excellent, it pretty much melts in your mouth. The menu is not very big however I was able to find everything I wanted. The staff was awesome so even if they don&#39;t have something you want I feel confident they would make it for you. I looking forward to my next visit.Second visit and it&#39;s still great quality sushi. They receive a fresh shipment on Tuesday. I recommend Tues night dinner or Wed lunch. Simply Amazing!!

Decent Sushi - it is fresh and presented in a visually appealing manner.But nothing so outstanding that I would specifically come back here and pay the prices.The place is spendy, and the waitstaff acts mechanical and a bit standoffish. The atmosphere just wasn&#39;t welcoming or inviting -- more I felt like I was just tolerated.Sadly, I&#39;ve found that San Francisco doesn&#39;t seem to have very friendly or helpful people at their tourist places and dining establishments.

Great find - loved the sunomono and calamari starters - both were sharp and slightly spicy. The udon and sashimi deal is wonderful - a huge bowl of udon noodles and a side of four pieces of sashimi.

I want to say right away that the sushi in this place are out of control!BUTthe service is out of control too. Sadly, it is not so great.We booked our dinner for 6:45 a week ahead (because nothing closer was available).As we roll in the hostess tells us that it&#39;s fine if we want to sit at the bar (we asked it with our reservation), but they have another reservation at 8 and we have to be kinda quick. It is a bit tight for dinner and we were about to have omakase! So we request to be seated at a table if that will give us more time, but none of the tables are available either.Isn&#39;t it what reservations are for? How are they expect people to eat dinner during 1 hour?The sushi were great! Each and every bite of it was the burst of flavors! I just wish we had more time to enjoy it.

I&#39;m not sure that Akiko&#39;s is *the best* sushi in the city, but I would recommend it to friends.- Most of the 4/5 star ratings pertain to Akiko&#39;s omakase offerings, so do that if you and your wallet are in the mood. Otherwise, their standard menu fare is not worth a special visit. If you don&#39;t like surprise bills, ask how much that day&#39;s omakase will cost.- Don&#39;t expect every single bite to be mind-blowing-- that&#39;s a pretty unreasonable expectation even for Michelin-starred restaurants. You&#39;re going to get a mix of decent everyday items with some imported/wild-caught items that change throughout the year based on availability. The opportunity to taste the latter is what you&#39;re really paying for when you do omakase here.- From the previous reviews, it sounds like they don&#39;t always provide the friendliest service, but they were plenty accommodating on our visit. Be polite and keep reminding yourself that you are not the Queen of England (unless you really are) and you&#39;ll likely be fine.- Not going to review their food because by the time you visit, you may be getting a slightly different menu. Browse the photos if you want an idea of what you&#39;ll get into at Akiko&#39;s.

This place is super easy to pass by. There&#39;s no signage or anything.. except for the Irish Pub which hangs on the corner - just makes it more confusing.Once you&#39;re inside, it kind of feels like a grungy Italian restaurant.. definitely not a nice sushi restaurant. I guess it&#39;s the hipster servers that give it away.Ordered a craaaaap ton of food. 2-4 orders of about 15 items on the menu. Some of the best salmon sashimis I&#39;ve ever tasted.. they literally melted in your mouth.The quality of this place is 5 stars. The one thing that makes me take off a star is that they keep the temperature inside way too hot.. which in turn makes the sashimi warm.

Small modern space with a selection of small plates and sushi which are reasonably priced.Had the tofu, veggie tempura, octopus, hamachi, and soup; we were full and content after our meal. The speedy and attentive service had us out of there in an hour and 15 on a Friday night. They try to turn the tables over quickly due to the limited amount of tables. The bar seating is also another option for a quick bite. Will come back soon when we remember to make a reservation:)

I give a 3-star if it weren&#39;t because of the uncooked rice! I was blindsided by the good yelp ratings and their photos.... Our 6 piece Nigiri Sampler ($23) were tiny and the rice weren&#39;t even cooked thoroughly (crunchy in the center)! The fatty white tuna belly weren&#39;t fatty at all ($10), then the Hamachi belly was okay ($10). Turns out I like Akiko&#39;s Rainbow Roll ($14), it has a bit of citrus or plum sauce (can&#39;t distinct) and deep fried soft shell crab ($10 4 pieces) was fine as well.

I was never a sashimi gal until Akiko charmed me with all the big fish descriptions and cute plating. The beef was frikken steak and damn it was heaven.. but truly, it was all tasty and I wish I had more but I didn&#39;t want to pay $20 for another meal and look like a fatass.Small place, I&#39;d make a reservation.

Best sushi meal I&#39;ve had in the Bay Area. Caveat #1: I have NOT been to Sushi Ran yet. Caveat #2: my brother&#39;s friend prepared most of the dishes that we had, so I&#39;m sure he made sure we had the best dishes on the menu. Despite those two things, I was very impressed and very satisfied with my meal at Akiko&#39;s. we had a table of six, and very beautiful, very delicious dishes kept coming out, starting with some delicious vegetables, a couple sashimi plates, and then delicious nigiri, piece by piece.I really loved the cucumber salad with crab, agedashi tofu, Spanish Mackerel sashimi, the blue shrimp, and the tuna shoulder (I can&#39;t remember what kind). Then, at the end, we were completely BLOWN AWAY by the black tuna belly with uni and the wagyu beef, which was just slightly seared and topped with truffle. WOW. Just two of the best bites I&#39;ve had, and just a perfect way to end the meal (until the delicious mochi ice cream came). We also tried the 49ers roll, which was good, but nothing special -- stick with the nigiri and sashimi! Not a cheap meal, but it was definitely a great place when you want to splurge on a great meal. Can&#39;t wait to go back again!

Great service, yet lack of vegetarian options.Since my friend, who gets obsessed of eating sashimi after his first visit of Akiko, highly recommended this restaurant, I decided to come here rather than my favorite Japanese restaurant Umami. Although my friend has only been to Akiko once awhile ago, the sushi chef and one of the waiters immediately recognized him and shook his hands. This shows that Akiko not only cares about the food, but also the people. This is prominent in particular when the sushi table was full even around 11 p.m. when my friend and I left the restaurant.According to my friend and his other friends, the sashimi at Akiko is extremely fresh and the sushi is well executed. Similar to the sushi chef at Jiro&#39;s Dream of Sushi (an award-winning documentary about a Japanese sushi chef), the sushi chef at Akiko thinly brushes a thin layer of soy sauce on the sashimi and a thin layer of wasabi on the rice in order to bring out the original flavors of food. If the food at Akiko is not so fresh, the sushi chef would not have been to do this.The only reason that I gave Akiko three stars rather than four stars is that it lacks vegetarian options. I could barely order anything there. Thus, unless you can eat or love eating deep sea fish, you are better off going to a different Japanese restaurant. Nonetheless, the tamago sashimi was hand-made and well-executed. I would not mind coming back to Akiko just for the tamago. However, I think the chef put way too much scallions in the miso soup that covers the original flavor of it.Overall, LG and I had a great experience there, and I would recommend you going to Akiko.Food: 4Service: 5Decor: 3

This place is my BF&#39;s and my favorite restaurant in the city. We&#39;ve come here three times and would most likely continue to come.Like I said in the previous review, they have a very romantic decor going on. It is usually a bit dark but there are candles on each table. The waiter is really nice and attentive. My BF and I haven&#39;t been here for a couple months and the waiter said &#34;welcome back&#34; Great memory!The first time we came with our friend I believe we received complementary edamane. The last time we went the BF got the udon while I got a donburi. We received two miso soups.

One of the best sushi spots in SF! Came up to the city for a quick weekend trip and decided on sushi last minute. Thanks to Yelp we were able to come across this little gem. The fish was fresh and practically melted in my mouth like butter. The rolls and saki were also really great!Ambiance is great and the service is exceptional. The decor is also modern and very clean but a bit tight. If you aren&#39;t ok with being a little intimate with strangers, then this isn&#39;t your spot.This places gets super packed so be sure to make a reservation ahead of time. We we&#39;re lucky enough to get seated in between reservations so make sure you plan ahead if you want to make a stop here. Huge fun - can&#39;t wait to go back!!

we went there for lunch, one of our ritual ladies lunches.. sushi sashimi, fish fresh. then we ordered a cooked food, cod fish. my friend cod&#39;s came first and waitress told me, sorry, please wait for a while, they are still cooking the other cod fish. i had to asked couple times n same answer. finally my fish came another 30 mins later. what a terrible service.. if they have problem with the kitchen or the fish, they should have told us and we could order other dishes.. my poor friend had to eat halfway and waited for my fish to arrive...

Must try once in your life.O M A K A S E $150 a person. Not worth it in my eyes, but the Truffle Wagu Beef was perfection!!! $30 for 2 pieces. The raw shrimp was $20 for 2 pieces, after that I was like jeez! I really enjoyed the fish here and my friend loved the uni. They gave a decent amount. I had better and cheaper elsewhere, but glad I came to try. Dinner only took one hour, but we were so hungry, we were probably eating too fast. I believe they use brown rice to make their sushi. Just don&#39;t get the mochi. One piece cut in half is $4. Lol!Service was great.

I don&#39;t think there is anything about Akiko&#39;s that stands out from the millions of other sleek &#39;n&#39; chic sushi restaurants playing pulsing music and offering sushi favorites at slightly-above-average prices. But that&#39;s not necessarily a bad thing. Who doesn&#39;t enjoy a well-made rainbow roll and a glass of wine after a long day?Speaking of rainbow rolls, Akiko&#39;s is tasty and well-portioned with lots of fresh fish. It is made with scallions, which I don&#39;t understand (SF sushi restaurants seem to really love putting scallions in rainbow rolls), so if you&#39;re not a fan of green onions like me, make sure to request no scallions. I also indulged and got some sea bream nigiri, one of the specials of the day. It tasted fresh but was a tad too....warm? Like it had been sitting under a lamp for too long.Prices are standard (not dirt cheap, but not exorbitant either) and service is decent. I wouldn&#39;t make a special trip to come here, but if you&#39;re in this part of FiDi, it&#39;s a good dinner option. Just make sure you make a reservation. The restaurant was full even on a Monday night.

Very good sushi and by the far the best sushi in the area.Lovely ambiance, unobtrusive service (traditional Japanese), wide variety of options on the menu, and excellent recommendations if you trust your server and the sushi chefs (you&#39;re silly if you don&#39;t). I often do 50/50 - pick what I &#39;must&#39; have and have them pick the rest.Every time I visit, I hear a lot of Japanese patrons. Very good sign.Arrigato, Akiko&#39;s - you rule the &#39;hood for sushi.

I vacillated between and 4 and a 5 (only because I *rarely* give 5 on a first date), but I really cannot refuse them a 5.Mumsy was fancying sushi downtown and I&#39;d heard about this place from a co-worker so booked a table. After being interrogated by Mumsy (is this place new? is the owner/chef Japanese? where do you get your fish from?) she was satisfied well enough to even look at the menu (and you think *I* am a sushi snob!).Everything was delightful. The service was awesome, everyone was friendly, the decor was a fusion blend of Japanese and San Francisco (love it!), the presentation was beautiful (sushi came on slate slabs), and even the hot sake came in its own little custom-made bottle of hot water (classy!).Of course the food is the MOST important, and we were not disappointed! We had hamachi (buttery), the salmon (perfect), the ikura (we had two orders - it&#39;s house-smoked in a little soy, sake and mirin, I believe), the ama-ebi (perfection), and saba, finished off with some takuan-maki.Their fish is so fresh, perfectly cut and the sizes were generous without being overwhelming slabs (one bite!). The rice to fish ratio was perfect too. It was so delightful and refreshing to see sushi done soooooo right!I&#39;m drooling just writing this review...I wonder how soon I get back there?

Having grown up by the ocean in Korea, I am naturally selective with my sushi.I rarely go out to eat sushi because if it&#39;s not fresh or done right by skilled chefs, there&#39;s just no point of spending a big chunk of my hard earned (or anyone else&#39;s) money for something that could be more likely mediocre.Akiko provided us an excellent experience.We ordered omakase for two with two bottles of Asahi. It was around $227 after the tax, and it took us about 2 hours.I won&#39;t go into details on the menu since the menu will be very different. But I cannot emphasize enough how much I love each sushi.. I loved all the fish that are not typically served in other restaurants and found ways to bring out the unbeknownst flavors, textures and orgasm!The service was excellent. They took their time between courses, but it didn&#39;t feel like we were waiting too long. Our servers were professional and friendly, no complaints.Thank you Akiko for an unforgettable experience.

Damnit, Asia has spoiled me when it comes to Asian food. Especially Japanese food.Freshly flown fish from Japan with authentic sushi chefs in Japanese run restaurants was the norm in Singapore. I like not fully understanding the Japanese chefs as they proudly display their craft. I like the traditional look and feel of the small Japanese establishments that made you feel like you were in the real deal.I should&#39;ve known I was in for a rude awakening when we walked past the Caucasian and Southeast Asian sushi chefs at the bar. Multicultural staff, which I can appreciate in most settings but the Asian in me doesn&#39;t like it in my Asian restos (I mean, imagine if you had a multicultural staff serving you in a Chinese restaurant... the first thing I would do is RUN). But hey, I&#39;m in SF now and gotta accept the fact.But then we get relegated to the back room in the back corner by the bathroom. It was like being in a tiny little cave where you could here everyone&#39;s conversations (or at least they could hear ours, I&#39;m fairly sure).To be fair, the food was decent. The sashimi, while cut in a fairly nontraditional fashion, was fresh and not grainy or sinewy. The salmon teriyaki, while a tiny portion, was melt-in-your-mouth tender. The rolls, while with slightly too acidic and moist rice, were fairly generous.But was it enough for me to return? Not until I get rid of this long-drawn Asia hangover...

Service was friendly and attentive, but who cares when the sushi is mediocre at best. 12 piece sashimi came with 3 piece big eye tuna, 3 piece salmon. And the cut was tiny triangular pieces. Definitely not worth the money. At this price point I expect way more. And better variety of fish in &#34;taster&#34; sashimi.

Some of the freshest sushi I&#39;ve ever had!! Loved the decor and feel. The service was amazing and always attentive of our drink levels, which I appreciate. The cucumber salad was really yummy. My favorite roll was the one with the lemon paper. Was sooo good. All the rolls we got were just as yummy and fresh! Definitely my new go to for sushi in the city!

Yes, definitely not cheap and they have their own way going about things but the food is exceptional.Fish, very fresh. Service, very fast and attentive. Saki, super fecken delicious two rounds down da hatch.Came in for dinner at 5:50 and was out by 6:50 satisfied. Portions are definitely not huge so wouldn&#39;t go here to stuff myself as I know it would get really expensive.With that said and IMHO the quality warranted the price and will be going back.Client/date spot for sure! Downtown sushi spot FTW!

I&#39;ve been to Akiko several times before and have always left the restaurant feeling hungry, even after spending $$$. Because of that I have to give it 3 stars. The fish is nice but very expensive. I don&#39;t mind dropping $$$ (and often do when it comes to sushi) but only if I leave feeling satisfied with the amount and quality of fish. You could get the same quality of fish elsewhere for cheaper.

I can honestly say that this is one of the best sushi restaurants that I have ever ate at. The price was on a bit of the high side, but I can honestly say I will definitely eat here again. Their Kobe beef nigiri with black truffle shavings was honestly one of the best things that I have ever ate.

I recently visited Akiko&#39;s again after I heard the place got a complete revamping. I believe it&#39;s reservation only now, so I went online and booked one on Opentable easily.When we arrived, our table was ready without any waiting time.My boyfriend and I went for the omakase menu since that is what people were raving about.All in all, the sushi was very good, but nothing mind blowing. I remember the salmon being exceptional and so was the ikura (which we added on top of the omakase). Price wise, it was over $130 per person for omakase, 2 additions of ikura and uni, and a corkage fee for the wine we brought. I felt like this was kind of overpriced given I&#39;ve had MUCH better sushi for relatively the same price in New York at Sushi Nakazawa.I also had a omakase meal in Hawaii recently that was $75 a person and much more filling and memorable so Akiko&#39;s unfortunately does not meet my par right now.

My wife and I came in for the Omakase and it was Amazing. Closest comparison I could give is Sanshigo on the Balboa Peninsula.The fish was extremely fresh, each sushi/nigiri was tastefully balanced with flavors of shiso, fresh truffle and ponzu to name a few.Would definitely recommend the place to true sushi enthusiasts. The price was by no means cheap but in the end still worth it.

Where I first tried octopus! Recommended, along with the gyoza.Haven&#39;t been back to this restaurant in a while, but I need to make another trip!It IS easy to overlook because there&#39;s not really a sign but it&#39;s right next to that open bar/restaurant area on this block of Bush St. Also, be aware that it&#39;s closed from 2:30- 5:30. It&#39;s definitely a more intimate setting with dark lighting and candles - great for date night!

Akiko&#39;s is one of the best Sushi restaurants in SF, period. It might not necessarily be the most authentic spot but it certainly boats a creatively enticing menu, rustic-trendy wine-bar-esque ambiance, fresh just-out-of-the-water fish, an extensive sake menu and highly knowledgeable servers. What more can you ask for on a night out with the girlfriends or a romantic date with the boy?I enjoy creative sushi rolls with a lot of depth and a combination of flavors. And that&#39;s exactly the forte of Akiko&#39;s.I highly recommend the Firecracker and Volcano Rolls. They are both fried, bursting with flavor and feature fresh fish with the perfect texture. Also, we ordered a bottle of sparkling sake... I can&#39;t remember the name but I assume that&#39;s a testament to how much we enjoyed it.So if you&#39;re in the mood for some good sushi around Union Square, definitely give Akiko&#39;s a try!

You haven&#39;t had great sushi in SF until you go to Akiko&#39;s. The otoro and uni are my two favorites - i didnt know uni can taste that amazing. The perfect combination of fresh ingredients and creative preparations. One of the best dishes is the slightly seared wagyu sushi with shaved truffles on top. I can eat 20 of those!

Went for my guy&#39;s bday. He wanted to finally try an omakase with me. Was warned due to the time of night, the entire meal would take 1.5 hrs. Entire meal realistically took 2 hrs. Only 4 courses. Such a disappointment. Nothing special in the omakase what so ever. Spent 300 on sushi we could&#39;ve got elsewhere for less than 100. Worst part of our vacation.

Hubs &amp; I got the omakase which was about 15 courses/pieces. The fish was very fresh and we had a few things we haven&#39;t had before, extra bonus! We enjoyed every bite but the more memorable ones - aji, umimasu, hotate, karuma ebi, uni from russia, crab porridge!, Wagyu topped with truffle :) Service was quick, and reservations are highly recommended. Love, it&#39;s our new sushi favorite in SF!

Popped in here for a quick light lunch.We got the omakase and it was pretty great for the price. Don&#39;t get me wrong, compared to places in where i&#39;m currently living this place is expensive, but for NYC its a damn good value.It&#39;s pretty far from exceptional but unless you are ready to spend $500+ you can&#39;t beat the price.

It left a sour taste in my mouth, the fish and the experience. High quality fish marred by too much lemon, soy sauce, and other unnecessary toppings. Don&#39;t get me wrong, everything still tasted good, but for $125/person, I simply expected better. Try Wako or Kusakabe instead.

3.5 stars. Sashimi is fresh but did not wow. The wow factor comes in the aged wagyu beef nigiri. Ooh yeah it&#39;s pricey but if you live up in nob hill, this should be an obvious choice for sushi. Aside from the difficulty finding a dinner reservation from this place, be sure to come physically prepared to be squeezed into a seat in their tiny little closet of a sushi bar. Wow this place is TINY.

Outstanding food. If stars were based on food alone, this would easily be a 4.5. I was joking with my friend about asking people at other tables if I could take pictures of their food for instagram, because everything really looked that incredible.Unfortunately, our overall experience was a little less enjoyable. A friend and I went at lunch in the middle of the week, and were seated fairly quickly. Beautiful atmosphere (although they really crowd the tables in), and the sushi bar looked really impressive.Our waiter was a little slow about getting to our table, and when he was finally ready to take our order, I asked about why types of fish were included in the sashimi sampler that came with a dish I was considering ordering. His response was &#34;the typical ones.&#34; Maybe he didn&#39;t know the answer, but as someone who is a little picky when it comes to sashimi, I wasn&#39;t really satisfied with his response. I ended up ordering something else, and that was that.Our food ended up taking about 30 minutes to arrive, which for a rice dish and udon seemed like a really long wait. My friend&#39;s udon was brought the to table a few minutes before my meal, which I always find to be a little irksome. Little things that I typically don&#39;t even think about, like water being refilled promptly, didn&#39;t happen.I&#39;d go back, because the food was really outstanding, but I&#39;d definitely make sure I have enough time for a longgggg lunch in my schedule.

This place is tiny! I felt squished and the tables for parties of two are so tiny. I felt like I was encroaching on my neighbor&#39;s space with my purse and jacket. The lighting is good and the light bulbs were quite fascinating though. I love that you can sit at the bar and watch the sushi chefs do their magic.Water: Inconsistently warm and then slightly chilled. No ice in my water, which was cool with me because it was cold that day!Wasabi: Delicious - it has a nice heat to it with a really addicting sweetness. I found myself snacking on the wasabi during the meal because it was so good.Ginger: Unimpressive and a little too sweet for me.Tako Nigiri (Octopus): Tiny, but fresh and had a great chewiness to it.Spicy Tuna Roll: This was no bueno for me. I could not taste the tuna at all amidst the spicy mayonnaise and the extra sauce drizzled on top of the roll, which also didn&#39;t seem to go well together for me.Nigiri with Salmon Teriyaki: I thought this was a forgettable dish and regretted I ordered this instead of loading up on the sushi. They serve four pieces of nigiri first and while the salmon was not cut very cleanly, it tasted deliciously velvety; the rest of the nigiri were forgettable and had little flavor. Small portions of rice, small portions of salmon but well flavored and had a great crisp to the fish. Vegetables were extremely mushy.

This place is extremely hard to find. I walked in when they just opened for service and wasn&#39;t able to get a table, just a seat at the bar. Sadly everything I wanted was &#34;not available&#34;. I settled for the sushi and sashimi tasting. They should have that right? The food was mediocre and over priced. Paid over $75 and left hungry. This is definitely not a $$ restaurant.

Came here on a slightly awkward date, and thought it was all right. Apparently the guy was recommended the restaurant by a friend, and he assumed the guys behind the counter were Japanese... so he said something along the lines of &#34;I heard they&#39;re just average&#34; in Mandarin to me. Turns out the main chef was an old Chinese dude, and he was shooting us smug glances the entire night. I would&#39;ve done the same if I were him, though... hahaha.We ordered the Ika, Wakame Salad, and Firecracker Roll and Unagi Donburi to share. The squid and seaweed were pretty standard, nothing out of the ordinary, but I really enjoyed the sushi and donburi. But then again, I always enjoy spicy sushi. The squid and eel were really nicely cooked and flavoured. I think the best part of the meal was the plating - we were sitting at the bar, so we could watch the chefs prep the food and everything looked so fancy! Lots of mini-torch action going on back there.Portions were average and the meal didn&#39;t really fill me up. It&#39;s a bit expensive, but this is one of those places where you pay for the ambiance and decor as well. The interior is really pretty, with wooden furniture, modern lighting, and a cool (yet classy) brick wall. Lots of seating inside, staff is friendly, but the food came out a bit slow.

I&#39;m not sure that I woudk brand this &#34;best sushi in town&#34; but it was definitely good. I just wasn&#39;t overly impressed! We ordered a few rolls and sashimi. The first 49er roll that came out was actually prepared differently than the second order. The two other gfs I was with noticed since they had dined before here. It was really slow yet it took long and the rolls came out staggered. What was odd was they were really annoying about taking reservations when it was 11:30am on a holiday week. I feel like they keep that air about them which I wasn&#39;t impressed with.Nonetheless, the rolls were good. We also had the Rock n Roll roll which was pretty good - prices were average but I feel like I&#39;ve been elsewhere and it&#39;s more bang for your buck. Sashimi was tasty we had a 6 piece order and I found that on the slightly pricier than most.The sake was so not impressive! We ordered a large and another small between the three of us - granted we wanted to drink! It just felt so dinky it came in this clay pot so it was extremely deceptive in size. Our total was a little over. $90/3 and I feel like I&#39;ve just had better despite the fact the quality was good.Ryokos is better!

Came here today for dinner and it was amazing. I went for the chef special which consisted of 7 different orders sashimi and 6 individual nigiri. I also listened to others and ordered the wagyu beef. If you are here this dish alone is a must. The sea urchin and wagyu beef is the best I ever had in my life. The toro is definitely third in line. I would come back in a heart beat. Our waiter was very nice and checked on us frequently. Expect to drop a couple here depending on what you order. Lastly, this place is a hole in the wall and has no signs. Just look for the Irish bar sign and its right beside it.

My husband and I are huge sushi fans, after trying many sushi restaurants in San Francisco and Bay Area, we finally found Akiko&#39;s!We&#39;ve been going to Akiko&#39;s at least once every 2 to 3 weeks for the past year and we still can&#39;t get enough of their amazing selection of nigiri. If you love large varieties of exotic nigiri/sashimi and great creativity then Akiko&#39;s is the place to go! They import their fish from Japan everyday and are carefully prepared and served on the same day. If freshness is what you are looking for then you won&#39;t be disappointed!The ambiance is nice and relaxing and the staff are all very attentive to our needs! Akiko&#39;s is definitely our go to place whenever we need to have amazing sushi!

Best sushi experience so far in SF...still waiting to fly over to Japan though.-We had the chef&#39;s tasting/choice option.---our sushi chef, was very nice and asked us what we liked for our preference of fish.-The fish is imported straight from the fish market in Japan.-The restaurant is family owned, which is really nice to see.-The dad of the sons who run the restaurant even came out with a special grilled salmon to share with us. We felt welcomed.-I did not have any of their specialty rolls, but that was not our intentions to began with. (Im sure they were just as delicious as the sashimi)-a few items that I remember that we had, a flying fish sashimi, kobe beef, and uni.-Price about $270~ plus for two people including drinks and a chef&#39;s choice option.-If you are wanting a real sashimi this is a great place to visit.-make reservations!!!!!!!

1. MAKE RESERVATIONS otherwise the wait will take forever OR you&#39;d simply be asked to come back at another time.2. STAY within the arena of SUSHI and/ or SASHIMI.Make a reservation is pretty much self- explanatory, unless you&#39;re willing to wait to be seated at the sushi bar. As I sat there eating, so many couples were turned away and told there weren&#39;t any tables available because they were all booked for the night.And simply order sushi or sashimi because the fresh is super FRESH. The raw pieces of fish simply melt in your mouth. We ordered the rainbow roll (super delicious) and the firecracker roll (deep fried and a spicy kick to it if you&#39;re into that) which was pretty good.In addition, we also ordered the nabeyaki udon (which was bland and only lukewarm) and adegashi tofu (which was LITERALLY four pieces of thinly sliced tofu thrown in the fryer with some sort of soy sauce thrown over it, not too impressive at all). All in all, I&#39;d definitely just stick to ordering sushi and sashimi.

Yes, the food is good. The maki is fresh and inventive. I can&#39;t tell you how happy it makes me to see a maki menu with nary a mention of mayo. Mayo on raw fish is a crime against nature. I almost danced a jig before side-eying the Philadelphia roll. Salmon and cream cheese has a time and place. Wrapped in seaweed is neither. Write it down! Ahem. The wine pours are generous. The service accommodating. You should expect these things from a very favorably reviewed SF sushi spot. If not, rethink the way you&#39;re living. So, since each and every review would/should speak in depth about the satisfying cuisine, I am going to spend a couple of paragraphs speaking on some other elements of Akiko&#39;s.1.) The name. This is completely personal to me but Akiko&#39;s is the name of one of my favorite dive karaoke bars in Louisville. Many night was spent there making bad decisions, singing terrible songs and openly mocking people who were extending earnest effort. So, points for making me smile, right off the bat;2.) Akiko&#39;s looks nothing like any other sushi spot I&#39;ve been to before. The dark lighting, exposed brick and cool flooring brought to mind thoughts of a hidden bar in England rather than a maki miracle in SF. Cheers and props to whomever came up with the look. It&#39;s distinctive, appealing and memorable;3.) The bathroom. I got stuck in it. Much like I would imagine a bar that Jack the Ripper forgot, the bathroom has one of those slot-latch lock thingies (you can tell I am very tech-minded, can&#39;t you?). In any event, it&#39;s small, sorta broke-down looking (it&#39;s clean; it just goes with the distressed motif) and a little scary in the serial-killer-could-pick-you-off-here sort of way.This might be the most useful review evAr.

What makes my experience so disappointing is that Akiko&#39;s had everything it took to become my favorite sushi restaurant in SF, but just failed miserably.Now, I will definitely give credit where credit&#39;s due: Akiko&#39;s has some of the freshest, unique, and delicious fish that I&#39;ve tried in SF. The Ankimo (monkfish liver) here was amazing, the Russian Uni was the best uni I&#39;ve ever had, and Hamachi nigiri was perfect. The ambiance of the place was incredible -- the brick wall blended with pipes and stucco felt like I was in some cool underground bar, but the lighting and atmosphere felt like I was in a tranquil spa in Kyoto.Where it goes miserably wrong, though, is with the service. Aside from the extremely slow service (it took about 15 mins for them to even acknowledge us at our table), our server Ray was a nice guy (I&#39;ll give him that) but it really felt like he was pushing orders on us way too aggressively. We felt like we were being upsold by a Comcast representative and it just wasn&#39;t pleasant. It was like he was only trying to get us to order only the most expensive sushi, rather than actually helping us with choosing items that we&#39;d actually enjoy. After we put in our order, our drinks were forgotten and we had to ask a busboy twice to get us the beers that we ordered. They didn&#39;t arrive until our third dish had already come out.But honestly, even that&#39;s excusable.What really pissed us off was that we ordered the Kuro Maguro (Chu Toro), since all of us really go to sushi restaurants for toro (everything else is a nice plus). First off, they ran out of every kind of toro, except for the Chu Toro, so we ordered that. Another server (not Ray) brings us our &#34;Chu Toro&#34; that obviously did not look like belly, so we asked him what it was. The server said it was the Chu Toro and we said &#34;Are you sure? That doesn&#39;t look like Chu Toro.&#34; He says: &#34;That&#39;s the shoulder cut, you ordered it&#34; and walks away. It wasn&#39;t until after the dinner that our server (Ray) comes and says: &#34;Oh by the way, we ran out of Chu Toro so we substituted it for the bluefin tuna shoulder cut.&#34;The whole exchange was just extremely shady. If you run out of toro, then you come tell us that you ran out of toro and ask if we&#39;d like to order something else instead. You don&#39;t sneakily throw something in there that we didn&#39;t order and try to trick us into thinking it&#39;s what we ordered. That whole experience really left a bad taste in our mouths.And by the way, what sushi restaurant runs out of 3 different types of toro on Friday night at 8pm?? I can&#39;t trust any sushi restaurant that can&#39;t get their inventory straight, especially for toro.---------------------------------FOOD:EXCELLENT: Ankimo, Russian Uni, HamachiVERY GOOD: Hamachi Kama, Santa Barbara Uni, California MakiGOOD: Aka Mutsu, Kamasu, A5 Wagyu w/ Truffle, Shiro Maguro, Sesame Ice CreamMEH: Amaebi (Blue raw shrimp), Unagi, Ikura---------------------------------Akiko&#39;s definitely has great sushi (when it&#39;s even available), so I&#39;ll give it the 3 stars that it deserves for the food. The experience that we had, however, can&#39;t push it any higher than that.

Wow, just wow.We had omakase for the first time and I&#39;m so glad we had it here. What an amazing meal prepared by Chef Ricky!!First of all he is a totally chill dude and so easy to talk to. Really funny to joke around with and the energy between him and the other 2 sushi chefs were awesome. It made sitting at the sushi bar so much more fun and exciting!Secondly, we had 14 &#34;rounds&#34; in the omakase, beer, and one sake and it came out to about $300 for 2 people with tax+tip. Quite pricey but very worth it for a once in awhile dining experience.I can&#39;t remember EVERYTHING we had but we started with:- Poke, the tuna was SO good. Literally like butter in my mouth. Nothing like I&#39;ve ever had even in HAWAII.- Hotate nigiri (scallops). Wrapped around a little rice and brushed with that sauce. So good and sweet.- Umami ikura - the fish roe. I was scared at first because I don&#39;t like the big fish eggs, but really good with the hint of wasabi.Kuro Maguro akami - blue fin with a simple brush of sauce, so good i&#39;m dying- Japanese Uni- Sake Copper r. - salmon. I usually don&#39;t like salmon but this one was nice and fatty and delicious- Kinmedai - like a snapper. Seared and was I think one of my favorites of the night- kuro maguro chutoro- Katsuo- ShiroSake from Alaska- Aka Mutsu- Skip Jack Tuna (I think??)- Shiro Toro- A5 Wagyu with TRUFFLE.I&#39;m forgetting 1 because he didn&#39;t charge us for one of them!But the STARRRR of the whole meal was the wagyu. Seared with a little bit of rice. Topped with a black truffle compote, a sprinkle of salt, then topped AGAIN with black truffle shavings!!! It was the best thing I ever ate!! So rich and luscious. I want to cry because it&#39;s over.DEFINITELY will be back!! Thanks chef Ricky!!

If you want to celebrate, this is the way. Soul shatteringly good 3 hour omakase experience. Nice modern decor, especially the sushi bar. EVERYTHING was like butter - including the salmon belly and hamachi belly. The blue fin tuna maguro from Boston was amazing. The uni on a spoon (I say &#34;spuni&#34;) was delicious! We sat at the sushi bar, watched the skillful preparation, and ate like champions. We paired with sake, which was also enjoyable. We ended with the waygu beef with tons of truffle.

After hearing about this place so many times from a good friend of mine. We finally found some time to make a reservation check this place out.Now for a first timer, thr place may be a little hard to find being that there is no real sign stating the name of the place and etc. You&#39;ll just have to remember their address.Overall we made reservations, was accomdated easily and had some outstanding service!Dishes I tried:- Unagi Nigiri- Fourty-Niner- 6 Piece Nigiri- Vegetable TempuraDessert- Black Sesame Seed Ice CreamLoved the freshness and taste of the sushi! The presentation was on point as well, loved their plating!The decor was amazing also! Fairly small place, but very welcoming.Best sushi place in SF in my books, can&#39;t wait to go back!

After walking everywhere to find a sushi restaurant that was open on New Year&#39;s Day, well night actually, we stumbled upon this place. Initially we were going to ryokos but it was closed. We had to wait about 10 minutes in the cold but it was totally worth it!! It was so nice and cozy, and the service was very good and quick. The food was so fresh and delicious. My next trip back to SF I&#39;m def coming back here!!

there&#39;s always a first for everything: I was reminded when I tried to walk into this place for lunch last Monday. I was turned away for not having a reservation. It was close to 2pm, the website said &#34;reservation encouraged&#34;, but apparently this is a must as my pleas were denied at the reception despite the sushi counter being empty and some tables vacant. I would think that one could walk into just about every restaurant in the city without a reservation and they&#39;d gladly welcome you if there was an open seat. but not here. I walked out into the street shocked, hungry, and pissed.

I was told 45 minutes before they closed and at least 3 empty seats at the bar that they were &#39;short staffed&#39; and could not serve me. If you are short staffed then pick up the silverware from the open spots on the bar. I got the distinct impression that I was not &#39;high class&#39; enough for this place. I had just got off from my software engineering job and had put on a pair of flip flops, to which the classy hostess looked at and denied me. Do yourself a favor and wear a tux to this place. I would hate to have nice plans here and be shut down for not meeting their sight test.I ended up going up the street to sushi Toni and spending $90 on an awesome feast. They even didn&#39;t mind my flip flops.

I am wary of places that are too dressed up for sushi. I don&#39;t like fusion sushi or fish that is way dressed in something that ruins the taste of pure fish. Sushi-snob I know.But this place is great - the specials proved to be fantastic. We ordered the omakase and even though I hate Saba Mackerel, the horse mackerel was pretty good. I love the tekka poke tuna dish they give you - huge chunks in a good marinade. The red snapper, ebi, and halibut were also among my favorites there. We tried extra things like tempura (not that great) and the scallop was just alright. I&#39;d stick to the special fishes for the day! Plus, make sure you make a reservation b/c I saw so many get turned away thinking walk-ins were welcome. Also, don&#39;t confuse this place with Akiko&#39;s Sushi Bar in Chinatown. The story is the sushi bar used to be where they were but they moved and sushi bar kept the name. This place is hard to see because it&#39;s not clear (no shop sign) it&#39;s right next to an alley for an Irish pub (I had the view from my seat right next to the main door)

We had a strange experience. Found this place via Yelp, but when we arrived we were told we had to have a reservation. So we left and our group made a rezo for 4 on Open Table for 45 min later. Meanwhile, had a drink next door. When we returned, we were refused service and told our reservation was no good because the empty tables were reserved for other reservations. I was a little embarrassed and very confused.So, no idea if the food is good. Service will prevent me from going again. If you go, be sure you make a reservation!

I found Akiko&#39;s a couple of years ago. I&#39;ve been a loyal fan since. I come to SF from Minneapolis for business about once a month. I try to eat there at least twice each trip.Joe and Mary (owners) are lovely people. Together they produce a great sushi experience. When I first came it was when few people were eating out (winter of 2009). Since then Akiko&#39;s has grown in popularity. My favourite dish is the crab and cucumber salad. It is so good it should be illegal! Everything is always fresh and the sushi rice is perfect.Come hungry and order anything - especially items recommended in other reviews. You won&#39;t be disappointed.

I took my boyfriend out to dinner for his birthday and made reservations here.When we got to the restaurant , it was small , but the interior was very clean and beautiful. It&#39;s not a place for big groups ; it&#39;s very intimate. It gets a little hot in there , though. Anyway.We ordered ,: Sashimi with Tempura ( you get 4 pieces of sashimi )- It was cut nicely and it was such fresh sushi. It was absolutely delicious.: Santa Barbara Uni ( his favorite )- The best uni we&#39;ve tasted so far. Made well and there was a nice sweet taste to it than the usual uni we get from other places. It was delicious.: Kurodai.- I forgot what it was , but it was silky and chewy. It was pretty good.: Sake Roll ( some kind of sake roll. )- It had sesames on one half of the roll and it was glazed in some kind of sauce that complimented the roll very well.: Spider Roll- This roll would probably be the best spider roll I&#39;ve had from most Japanese restaurants. The sauce wasn&#39;t overwhelming and everything complimented itself. Crunchy thaaaangs. I love soft shell crab.: ( dessert ) Mochi Ice Cream.- We had a serving of Green tea and Sesame flavored mochi ice cream and it was great to have in the end.The portions of the food isn&#39;t what I expected when I first went there , but the quality of everything was amazing. I would probably come back here for a little munch , but it wouldn&#39;t get me full right away.But I would come back to try out their new things !

We had dinner here before going to a show, and were really happy with our experience.I was impressed by how knowledgeable our server was. He seemed to know where every fish on the menu was sourced from, and he wanted to tell me about the owner&#39;s efforts to be ecologically friendly. I love that they are providing local, and sustainable options. Yes, it is a little more expensive, but don&#39;t we all want to still have sushi to eat in the future? I wish more sushi places would do this...(Ok, stepping off my soapbox...)The sushi can get expensive, but the other items are surprisingly inexpensive. My guy&#39;s tonkatsu was also one of the better ones I&#39;ve tasted. (he orders it all the time, and i always steal a bite.)I loved my sashimi and nigiri. Everything was so fresh, had such great flavor, and was cut perfectly.If this place was a little more convenient to get to, I&#39;d definitely return.

I know I was supposed to love this place but it really fell short of my expectations.No doubt the fish itself was fresh and buttery. However, the roles were sub-par and the Ikura (cured in house, apparently), was incredibly under salted.It&#39;s also rather pricey and the service was only acceptable -- we weren&#39;t checked on at all during our meal.While if I&#39;d had sashimi only, I may have been happy, everything else was only okay. I don&#39;t think I&#34;ll go back.

Hands down, the food and service here are exceptional. I&#39;ve been to this restaurant a few times already and they never disappoint. They have many dishes to choose from, and I feel like I never have to stick to one particular &#34;safe&#34; dish each time I visit.Once I ordered octopus much to the waiter&#39;s surprise (and delight?), which made me confused at first. He arrived with the plate, and when I started eating a piece and couldn&#39;t seem to find a moment to stop chewing on it, I noticed the Japanese chef who prepared my dish was laughing at my efforts to eat octopus. I didn&#39;t realize how tough octopus could be, and it&#39;s perhaps rarely ordered at the restaurant, but I still enjoyed (and finished) it. It was a fun experience, and I think the chefs do an amazing job.I guess one downside would be that you have to make reservations in order to eat here, but honestly, I didn&#39;t have to make any reservations too far in advance. It&#39;s a rather close and intimate setting, so I&#39;d definitely bring a date to impress!

So, my experience here did not start out great to the point I wanted to give them like 1 to 2 stars. We had a reservation for 3 people for 8 PM. We arrived on time and noticed there were a lot of people waiting and that one couple was already very upset.After about 30 minutes of waiting &amp; a lot of tables being seated I realized we were going to waiting a long time for a table because all their tables are two seaters so for there to be a big enough table to fit 3 two table would have to leave. Finally the hostess offered us a free beer for our wait which was a nice start to the long wait.Well at 8:50 or so the 9:00 reservations start to arrive and be seated. At that point a spot opened at the sushi bar that would fit 3. We inquired about it and were told that they were working on getting us a table and proceeded to seat two gentlemen at the sushi bar spot, note they had walked in like 5-10 minutes before we mentioned that spot. Well at this point of an hour of waiting we were all hungry and pretty frustrated. I inquired why we were not seated at the spot at the sushi bar and were informed that the two patrons were VIPs and the manager told the hostess she had to seat them there because it was the best seat in the house. I then asked to speak with a manager because that is just bullshit after waiting an hour! Well the manager would not come over and by then another spot at the bar had opened up, so basically the manager avoided us.We sat down and were served a free app pretty quickly and choose our sushi as quickly as possible. The sushi came and was AMAZING! The manager kept coming to visit and gave us a free sushi roll, hot sake, and dessert which was a nice touch after waiting an hour when we had a reservation. However, if the food had not been so awesome I would never consider going back again. RECOMMENDATION: DO NOT GO IF YOU ARE LARGER THAN A PARTY OF 2!

Like a parking ticket you forgot to pay, a few of these rolls came up and smacked me in the face. By nature I have wussy mouth syndrome, so spicy food is constantly sneaking up to slap me around, but when I tried the firecracker and the dynamite rolls, I was genuinely surprised at the heat.Undoubtedly, someone out there will read my words, order one of these rolls, and be disappointed that it doesn&#39;t even warm their tongue. Again, people, I&#39;ve got a hardcore case of wussy mouth syndrome, so for me it was surprising enough.What I can say with certainty is that this joint is intimate and perfectly lovely. I had a nice dinner here with friends from work and we were able to score a long table in the back with plenty of room for our hefty group. Not that we&#39;re each hefty. Just that the size of our group was hefty. You&#39;ll probably want to get a reservation if you&#39;re seating more than a two-top. I was here on a weeknight and it was pretty full.It&#39;s simply decorated and I&#39;m a sucker for exposed brick. The menu is simple and although I didn&#39;t get the sashimi, it looked to be nummy and well-cut so don&#39;t overlook that part of the menu.Rolls are moderately priced. Some inexpensive options down at $7-8, and some higher priced up near $15. Still a steal for the quality coming out of the kitchen and they were generously sized. By the end of the night, our group was a little more hefty. Not in number, but in actual measurement. Good sign.

Sushi, baby! This was a great intimate space. Loved the brick walls, the long slim tables, the subtle touches of class. A great spot to sit with some friends for a nice evening out.And it&#39;s cheap sushi too! Ok, well, maybe not cheap cheap, but with rolls ranging from $7 to $15 for real nice specialty ones. I was impressed with the quality of the dishes too. ReallyI was out with a large group so we just all ordered a ton of sushi to share. They did a really great job of staggering them to come out. We finished a few rolls and then they brought out a few more, instead of dumping them all on the table. I wish they would have let u know though which roll was which. They just planked it down and then left, and we had to sort of guess what they were. Oh well, the food was so good I almost didn&#39;t care.Few annoyances - sometimes it was hard to get a waiter&#39;s attention, especially as we were all the way in the back and couldn&#39;t really signal him. Also my miso soup came in a bowl that you were supposed to sip out of (instead of using a spoon), only the bowl was terrible for sipping - everything kept getting caught on the rim. I asked for a spoon and it never came. I just ended up doing the best I could with the sipping.I would go back here again, even with that. I&#39;m semi-torn between three and four stars, but I walked out happy, so I&#39;m going with four. Mmmm, sushi.

I really, really wanted to like Akiko&#39;s Restaurant - a hip sushiya with modern original dishes and snazzy ambiance. In the end though, Akiko&#39;s was just a 3/5 experience. I&#39;m not quite convinced that I can give Akiko&#39;s a badge of sushi excellence.Positives* The Chef speaks Japanese, appears to care an have pride for his food.* Decor and vibe rocks - great place to spend time.* They carry Orion, a great beer from Okinawa.* Carry 3 kinds of Uni (Santa Barbara, Hokkaido, Russian Tokujiyo from Kaigara)* Cryogenically frozen Monkfish Liver (Ankimo) shaved on top of Uni!!Negatives* Bar unsuitable for sushi enthusiasts - it&#39;s thin and too short, hurts your arms to rest them on the edges of the counter.* Very pricey, every order of nigiri comes on a separate plate instead of being set on the same Geta (Samurai Shoe) like in traditional sushiya.* The fish underwhelming - not very fresh but not old either - for the price this was definitely expected. Just the look of the fish in the neta cases revealed this.* No real wasabi - instead just run of the mill horseradish with wasabi powder. Did have wasabi paste (which is better) but the waiter took my plate while I was eating it...* 2 Chefs was clearly not enough for how busy it is, counter sitters get neglected* no salmon roe (ikura), guessing no demandAll in all there was enough good things about Akiko&#39;s that I&#39;ll probably give them another chance, but considering Sanraku doesn&#39;t do any of the negatives listed above - I might have a hard time.

By far, one of THE BEST sushi experiences I have ever had. We made a reservation in advance, which is highly recommended (if not required), we asked to sit at the bar (which I highly recommend). For the first hour, the business at the bar was relatively slow, so we had chef Ricky all to ourselves. We ordered two different kinds of sake, both were delicious! We had the omakase and specified around 15 pieces for approx 100/person. We added a couple of rolls (chef&#39;s choosing), the Russian uni (which is A MUST).The omakase consisted of EXTREMELY FRESH direct from japan over-night-flight fish. They were all exceptionally delicious and fresh. What really stood out for me was the fish that was topped with the pate, the scallop, the fresh ebi shrimp (the one at M.P.), the russian uni, and of course the wagyu beef topped with rendered beef fat and TRUFFLES!The service was fantastic, the fish was phenomenal, and the price (~370 total for 2 people) I felt was very fair for the quality you get. I will be back soon!

A hidden wonderful sushi place. The service was wonderfully attentive. They were pretty busy but were able to squeeze us in on a Monday night. (A sushi place open on a Monday!) It&#39;s a fairly small place so I would recommend reservations as the sushi bar is also covered by reservations. Definitely a good date place.The sushi was fresh and tasty! We ordered a couple of the combo meals (comes with miso soup), salad, and some nigiri including sweet shrimp (yay! Fried shrimp heads!). They also have a decent selection of drinks and sake.No complaints other than it&#39;s a little more than what I&#39;d spend everyday otherwise I&#39;d be there for dinner multiple times a week!

Try to sit at the bar so Chef Ricky can work his magic, handcraft each dish to perfection, suggest what to drink with your dishes and send you on a surreal journey...He&#39;s what I call a &#34;sushi consultant/sushi therapist&#34; and knows how to make sure you leave satisfied. Get ready to become a repeat customer...

I came here for lunch with a friend and we arrived early to avoid the crowd. The plan worked out well because by the time we were done, the place already filled up.I took the recommendations from the reviews here to try the Volcano Roll and it lived up to my expectations. Spicy, crispy, and the food looked like a volcano with lava flowing out. We also had their hamachi and spicy tuna sashimi pieces and topped it off with a Rainbow Roll.The service is prompt and efficient even when the place was super busy during noon. The food did not take long to come out and we took our time eating.I recommend this place with a solid four stars for the food, ambiance and choice location. It is very difficult to find good sushi in the Financial District that is within walking distance for lunch. This is conveniently located next to Irish Bank on Claude Lane.

Life changing sushi experience. Fresh, rich, unbelievably delicious fish. Fantastic sake options as well. We come from Louisiana so we have our fair share of great seafood, particularly amazing oysters and shrimp. We came to San Fran to find the best sushi next to Japan, and Akiko&#39;s definitely spoiled us. Don&#39;t think I will look at sushi the same way again. There are a few other good places we tried - Arctic char is amazing if you can find it, but everything at Akiko&#39;s was superior.We stuck to nigiri and sake. A few reviews criticized their rolls, but I think this is a place you come to appreciate pure fish in sushi or sashimi form, not rolls.Great service too. Had a cozy corner to ourselves on a Monday night. Best. Sushi. Ever.

Once you&#39;ve had sushi in Japan, it&#39;s a little more difficult to satisfy a sushi craving here in the states, but definitely possible. You can&#39;t just walk into any sushi joint and be satisfied (though in Japan you can go ANYWHERE and the sushi is on point), if only it were that simple and easy. Cue Akiko&#39;s.I came here on NYE and had their prix fixe menu and in that menu contained a nine piece omakase. Nine pieces of nigiri heaven, YUM. While everything on the menu sounded amazing, the omakase is what I was most excited for. It was definitely super satisfying, but what really hit it out of the park were the add-ons we got. I couldn&#39;t help it. If I wasn&#39;t planning on returning to this place for a long while, I wanted to make my trip worth it. We added on the uni, both the Hokkaido and Russian. The Hokkaido was creamy and light, not like any uni I&#39;ve tasted (I usually eat Santa Barbara)... no other words to describe it other than &#34;fresh&#34;. Not fresh as in it was flown in overnight to preserve it&#39;s freshness (which it likely was), but fresh as in the freshness of eating an ice cold watermelon on a hot summer day. Maybe refreshing is a better word for it? If uni could be refreshing, the Hokkaido uni is just that. The Russian uni on the other hand... it&#39;s rich, creamy, and full in flavor. So, so good... best uni I&#39;ve ever consumed, I totally wanted more.One of the other add-ons was.. can you guess? Yep, otoro. Of course, it was melt in your mouth delicious. Without a doubt everything you&#39;d expect from a good piece of otoro.If you&#39;re looking for good omakase I highly recommend Akikos.

One of my top sushi places in SF. Sushi here tastes unique almost like the sashimi we tasted in Japan. All fish here are VERY fresh.Ordered nigiris:Japan uni- very rich and sweet tastingHotate- fresh and sweet tastingAma ebi- again sweet. Also the heads were fried to perfection and are quite different slightly in taste (an awesome way) from other sushi places ive been toChutoro- very rich and fatty. The oils on it tastes almost like the ones that came from the Tsukiji Fish Market in Japan.Masaba- also tastes like the ones from TsukijiA5 Wagyu- GOTTA order this one! Melt In your mouth beef with a sauce that drove me crazy!Price is kinda higher than other great places like Zushi Puzzle and Sakae Sushi but its got another variety of tastes and style here.

Came here for an early dinner w/ my co-workers. The place was empty at 5:30pm on a Thursday night, but quickly filled up as the evening progressed. I absolutely loved the cozy and dimly lit atmosphere here. It&#39;s very romantic and a great place to take a date, although it could get a bit loud since all the tables are situated so closely together.The 6 of us shared the: Volcano roll, Firecracker Roll, Dragon Roll, 49er roll, Spicy Tuna maki and some edemame.Standouts were Volcano Roll and Firecracker. Both had a good spicy kick to it.Pros:1. Very cute atmosphere. From the plates and glasses they use to the decor (awesome wall artwork and candles everywhere!)2. Attentive service3. Fish was fresh4. Rolls creativeCons:1. Expensive (Volcano roll was $14, small bowl of miso soup $2.50!)The bill came out to be about $20 per person after tax and tip. Not too bad, except i was hungry again at 9pm. :( All in all, this is one of the better sushi places i&#39;ve tried in downtown SF, so do check it out when you&#39;re nearby and in the mood for some good fish.

I am usually not a fan of japanese food since I don&#39;t really like raw fish but I tried it there and it was awesome. Really good nigiri, I also recommend the 49ers rolls. Surprised by how good the wasabi was too! This is fresh food. The only negative point might be the service which was not really fast but still ok. It might be a bit expensive but the food is of quality.

I&#39;ve eaten here a couple times and been impressed both occasions. I know if you look at my other reviews I&#39;ve mainly been giving out 4 and 5 stars but these places have all exceeded my expectation in service and food, including Akiko&#39;s.Both times I&#39;ve went to Akiko&#39;s for dinner I&#39;ve had reservations. It&#39;s a smaller sushi place so they do turn people away. But I must say there aren&#39;t too many sushi restaurants that have wowed me like this. I&#39;ve had a variety of dishes from the menu. From rolls to sashimi and from poke to steak and ribs. &#34;Steak?&#34; you say? Yeah, how crazy is it that a Japanese sushi restaurant can make such a great steak! The fish is super fresh and I&#39;ve had sea life that I&#39;ve never heard of before.I can rave on about this place for days but I won&#39;t. Instead I&#39;ll be heading back to Akiko&#39;s with camera in hand to show you just how awesome this place is!The Good:- fresh seafood (a must at a sushi restaurant)- great selection of sake- personable sushi chefs- small and intimateThe Bad:- n/a

Probably the best place downtown to get sushi if you&#39;re in the mood. Sadly, the Financial District is lacking in this department - but really does make up for it with a plethora of other great places. As expected, the sushi is by no means &#34;cheap&#34; (if it is, you&#39;ve got a problem).. But I was pleasantly surprised in that it wasn&#39;t AS expensive as I expected and was excellent. Too often you get overpriced and/or sub-par sushi here in the city.We had the firecracker roll and volcano roll. Awesome! I was a bit bummed that they did not have the hamachi kama, but we can save that for another day.Service was outstanding. Be sure to make a reservation as they rarely (if ever) take walk-ins!

I had a great time here! Made a reservation the day of, and was seated right as I walked in. I was even able to change my seating from a table inside to right in front of the chef. Dinner and a show!I got the omakase because, honestly, I know nothing about sushi and I liked not having to decide what I wanted to eat. I wish I could say what we got, but it was all over my head. All you need to know is that it was DELICIOUS. The chef was pretty cool and talked to us the entire time, and I can honestly say I enjoyed every piece. My favorites had to be the russian uni, wagyu beef, and the ama ebi.I&#39;d give it 5 stars, but I&#39;m cheap and the place was a little pricey for my tastes, about 120 per person. Service was great, always had servers filling up my glass/taking away old plates. My lady friend was impressed though, so I guess it was worth it. I&#39;ll definitely come back here again. The chef mentioned that Mondays were a little less interesting due to it being the weekend&#39;s scraps - try coming after Wednesdays!

Went to Akiko&#39;s based on reviews and I must say the reviews were spot on. The sushi was the freshest I can remember having. While the sushi menu is not extensive, there are a good number rolls and creations on the menu such as to not overwhelm you while still presenting you with a fine selection. The sake list is good as well, try the sake sampler.It&#39;s a smaller place with a chic decor and good lighting. Reservations are definitely recommended. It was a pleasure watching the sushi making process from the sushi bar. Try the ocean trout!This is my new favorite sushi spot in SF.

No sign at this place, reservation for 9pm and was seated promptly. Great rolls, including the tuna one that was market priced (forgot what it was called). The grilled saba (mackerel) fish was too salty, but our server took it off the bill. Other than that, service was great. One of the most polite waiters, actually!

I liked this sushi spot a lot. From the outside, it looks like an Irish pub with no signage. Once you step inside, it&#39;s quite intimate and definitely a place to grab a date.We ordered the sashimi sampler and a few rolls - 49er, Rainbow and Spicy Tuna. The 49er was pretty good but I really preferred their Rainbow roll especially with the different colored tobiko on top.A couple next to me was sharing a bowl of udon but I didn&#39;t see it on the dinner menu. Maybe it was off a secret menu or their lunch menu. It looked delicious and definitely worth it on a cold night in the Financial District.Service was quite slow but given that my date and I were chatting a while, we didn&#39;t seem to mind all that much. It definitely made us drink more than we ate.

Visited Akiko&#39;s a few weeks ago and was very impressed.This is a reservation only establishment, but let me tell you, it is well worth doing some planing to make time for this gem! It is definitely a popular destination and is small, so weekend rez might be tough, so give a weekday a try!So far Akiko&#39;s has been the best sushi I&#39;ve had in San Francisco! 5 Stars all the way. Great food, service, ambiance and overall experience.We had a variety of sushi/sashimi and rolls and found everything to be incredibly fresh, beautifully constructed/presented and most importantly everything was awesome-sauce delicious!Our server had some great suggestions from the daily special for us to try and he hit the nail on the head with a salmon from the west coast waters that was UNREAL!Additionally, we had some Udon and it was fantastic as well. I&#39;d highly recommend anyone to check out Akiko&#39;s NOW!

It&#39;s taken me a while to write this review because I&#39;m so torn. The sushi was very good, and the atmosphere was fun. It was a nice spot for a cozy date night with the hubby and even here we were attempting to make it more of a cheap weeknight date than a splurge. We felt this was clear from what we ordered, and let me make it clear that we always tip well when we are cheap because we don&#39;t want to punish the waiters.When ordering we asked our nice waiter for a recommendation on the nigiri. He responded with a special tuna that was on the menu that night. It was listed as &#39;market pricing&#39; but considering nothing else was that outrageous we decided to go with his recommendation. He came back a few minutes after taking our order to say that the chef recommended the other cut of the tuna we had ordered so we went with it. Never once did he mention anything about the price.When the bill came it was $25 for the order of tuna nigiri, almost doubling the bill. I understand that it is priced where it should be, but a little warning that it was so much more expensive would have been the courteous thing to do. No good waiter points out only the most expensive item when asked for recommendations without also giving more reasonable options. To be honest it ruined the whole dinner for us. Not sure we&#39;ll be back.

So, these people complaining about the portions &amp; timely service...this was my experience:It&#39;s sushi. Japanese food in general does not come in &#34;USA&#34; sized portions, it never has. You may be surprised but not all countries feel the need to gorge themselves every time they sit down for a meal. The portions were fair and generous for the price.Also, I think most people forget that despite it&#39;s trendy atmosphere; this restaurant IS NOT A CHAIN. It&#39;s a FAMILY OWNED &amp; RUN restaurant. I had no issues with the service even during busy dinner hours. They were super friendly, it was easy to get their attention and they were spot on with everything. The chef even smiled and said, &#34;Thank you&#34; as we left. :)The food, was good. We have had our fair share of Japanese food around San Francisco and I thought the food was one of the best in the city.We were being pretty piggy, I thought, with a bottle of sake, 7 piece chef&#39;s choice sashimi plate (consisted of sake (salmon), &#34;big eye&#34; maguro (tuna), &amp; sea bass), 2 miso soup cups, edamame shared, 3 rolls (Dynamite, Volcano, Firecracker), and 4 pieces of mochi for dessert. Cost us roughly $68.00 for 2. That is incredibly cheap for sushi in the city!*I might add, 3 tempura style rolls, wouldn&#39;t recommend it &amp; will not do it again.+1 For the atmosphere.+1 For the friendly staff.+1 For the delicious food.+1 For the price.Thanks Akiko&#39;s!

Best. Sushi. Meal. Ever.Seriously, you won&#39;t find a better traditional sushi meal outside of LA and Tokyo - every experience I&#39;ve had here has been genuinely superb. First off, you&#39;ll want to make reservations. We&#39;ve been turned away due to lack of space on Tuesday nights! Once you&#39;re in, if space allows sit at the sushi bar ask chef &#34;Joe&#34; to simply make you what&#39;s good (omakase nigiri) and he will BLOW YOUR MIND. I&#39;ve had so many different varieties of fish that I never even knew existed, and experienced flavors I had no idea could come from fresh fist. He even convinced my wife to like Uni, which is something that even The French Laundry failed to do!I&#39;m not sure what their rolls are like but, in my humble opinion, you&#39;d be underutilizing your time, dollars and some awesome fish if you order rolls here. Stick with dishes that highlight the fish and you won&#39;t be disappointed!

Great little place to get fresh sushi! I thought considering the high quality of the sushi the prices where quite reasonable. Very home style place not fancy at all. Staff was friendly and helpful. We were there on the early side of a weekday evening and we got seated right away with out a reservation, they told us that they would like the table for a certain time for another reservation but the kitchen was a little slow and we could not leave with in the expected time but they did not bother us or try to rush us at all.

Been here twice for lunch and I wasn&#39;t impressed with the food either time. The sushi rolls ranged from decent to bad, depending on which ones you order. The 49er roll is perhaps my biggest recommendation. For the more &#39;traditional&#39; dishes such as udon or rice bowls, there are vastly superior choices near downtown SF. The huge redeeming factor is their ice cream mochi. There are times that I want to eat just the dessert from Akiko&#39;s. In addition to the subpar service, I feel that the price isn&#39;t worth the food served.

Had a wonderful lunch here while doing the procrastinated Xmas shopping. It&#39;s funny because I passed here numerous times when I worked nearby and never went in; always seemed close or something and/or I didn&#39;t want to cough up that much for a lunch back then.Sat at the bar and was attended to quickly and mindfully for the entire meal.Ordered the tuna roll and 49er roll and both were excellent! They also had Asahi on draft, by the way.) Each roll was freshly and carefully prepared. I especially loved the thinly sliced pieced of lemon atop the 49er roll. Yum!It&#39;s been a while since I had excellent sushi and I was stoked to finally find a place that stood out. I&#39;ll return for dinner in the near future!

The food was very good but we were disappointed with the service. The server and the chef both ate in front of us. The server often approaches us with mouth full. When it came time to pay the bill the server closed the wrong check. Upon realizing what she&#39;d done she asked us for cash to pay the difference. She tried to get me walk to an ATM down the street. I refused and said she could run the card again for the difference or void the payment and re- run the cars. She eventually phoned the owner to find out what to do. While on the phone more customers came in. She yelled across the room that they were closed. It was 9:30 on a busy Saturday night. This was apparently not their policy because the chef panicked when he realized the owner was still on the phone and could hear they were closing early. The checkout took about 15 minutes to resolve. Bad form all around.

The fish is decently fresh. But that&#39;s about all I can say about that.1. Super slow service and we went right when they opened (aka beat the lunch rush).2. Chirashi barely had any fish in it...maybe the dinner version is better, but the lunch one was majorly dissapointing for $20..they could have added at least 2 more slices of fish3. Our friend&#39;s dish came out 15min after all our dishes and he only ordered one roll.TIP: Try your luck at the sushi bar instead. Our table experience was terrible. At least then you can order directly from the sushi chef at the bar.

So I don&#39;t know if this is true, but my friend was telling me that this restaurant used to be a church...???!! I guess it&#39;s plausible, given that there was a huge wooden cross next to the door that went downstairs(?)Anyway, thank you to some higher being for allowing Akiko&#39;s to exist and serve hungry people delicious food!It was pretty empty when I arrived here with a party of 8 others, so I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s why the staff was super attentive...not that it&#39;s a bad thing! I&#39;m just wondering...the server actually poured the soy sauce for me!Food-wise, Akiko&#39;s was super yummy! One girl got the volcano roll (EPICNESS), I got the Futo roll (egg, avocado, cucumber, spinach), and I shared wakame salad with my friend. I can&#39;t really judge this place since it was my first time, but so far, so good! The guy next to me was raving about the sashimi and he was talking about how the chef has been involved in the art of crafting sushi since he was 13, SO I&#39;m thinking next time I come here I will have to order something fish related!

I yelped &#34;top restaurants in Union Square&#34; and Akiko&#39;s was on the list.After a day if shopping we got there right when it opened at 5:30. First ones seated! They mentioned that their kitchen was closed and were only serving sushi. That kinda gave me mixed feelings at first but didn&#39;t bother us too much since we were there for the sushi.When I came back from using the bathroom, the restaurant was packed! Mostly everyone in there had reservations. Once it got packed, they started turning people away! We were shocked and asked them why they do that . There explanation was &#34;so we could focus our time on the customers here and not have to feel rushed.&#34; also they make EVERYTHING fresh so they take their time with their food. I was impressed.So overall, the service was great! I love it when servers really converse with you. The food was THE BEST SUSHI I&#39;VE EVER HAD!!! You must try the Volcano roll that everyone yelps about as well as the Forty Niner roll! Oh, and make sure you make reservations! We lucked out by being the first ones there! The prices were a little pricey for sushi but you&#39;re paying for great quality AND quantity. Each of our rolls came with about 10 pieces.

This is by far my favorite sushi restaurant in San Francisco. The fish is very fresh and the service is prompt and efficient, (these guys don&#39;t want to know how your day was, but they are more than happy to help you with the menu.)If you are a die hard sushi fan I would stick with either the sashimi or the nigiri. The specialty rolls are good, but I found the sauces and extra attention they receive drown out the flavor of the splendid fish.The restaurant is a little cramped and is always busy so make sure you make reservations as you will probably not get in otherwise. Also, avoid sitting by the door if you can, you will be very cold every time the door opens.

Just visited akikos for the second time last night and was again impressed. The fish is so fresh and beautifully presented. I definitely recommend getting the chef&#39;s selection, or, if you have time, the omakase. I&#39;ve tried lots of things I&#39;d never order or thought I didn&#39;t like. Last night Monkfish Liver was a nice creamy surprise. My only beef is that the place is not labeled so it&#39;s hard to spot. I kept walking past because I thought it was an Irish pub.

This sushi was by far the best sushi I&#39;ve ever tasted. The rolls I ordered were the rainbow and 49er. Something unique about everything I ordered. The Katsuo was so good, it literally melted in my mouth. I would recommend ordering that last. You do need to make a reservation though so don&#39;t just show up, they&#39;ll turn u away even though it looks dead. The iced tea was bomb too, but they do charge you for each drink. Totally worth it ;-)

Its only been a few days since I ate here and I barely remember it. Not a good sign. The rolls were mediocre... service as great because they wont leave a tea cup or water glass empty. However, the reservations requirement is a bit ridiculous. Seats were empty and supposidely &#34;reserved&#34; but no one ever sat down while we were there. They turned away many people who would walk in and try their luck. I dont know if they&#39;re trying to look like a very uppity, high class establishment but maybe they need to change this policy....seems bad for business. The host, younger asian guy, seemed to hate his job. He wasn&#39;t rude but he looked extremely inconvenienced by anyone walking through the door.I&#39;d probably come back for a to go order, only because its walking distance from work. Otherwise, I&#39;d go to Tataki or Sushi Bistro.

I don&#39;t even know where to begin with Akiko&#39;s. I&#39;ve been here twice, and both times had the omakase (chef&#39;s choice), and it tasted amazing both times. I also loved the Tonkatsu, the fish is incredibly fresh, and there is a wide variety of options to choose from - most coming straight from Japan. I asked for a recommendation on the sake, and was not disappointed. However, I wouldn&#39;t recommend the Passion Fruit Saketini. Thank you Akiko for an unforgettable experience and excellent food. The service can be a bit slow, but if you with a large group you probably won&#39;t notice - and their amazing food is worth the wait.

We were here last night and yes, reservations are highly recommended because it is a very small place. I can probably remember how many tables are in there plus the bar-like sitting area. It&#39;s a small cute place. Be prepared to sit pretty close with the next table.I loved the food. We ordered the duo with Nigiri and Salmon Teriyaki, we shared it and it was pretty good. Then we ordered 2 rolls. The 49er roll and the rainbow roll which took forever to arrive but only because our server held the order and forgot to send it BUT that would not really affect my rating because it was so worth the wait! It was the right size and amount. We left there with happy and full tummies!Oh and to show that they are very sorry for the delay, they gave us a free Sapporo beer because ours was about to be done anyway :)Price wise, it was OK, on the expensive side if you want to satisfy your sushi craving, but again, it&#39;s really good.Totally recommend the place and don&#39;t forget to make a reservation!

I&#39;ve been to Akiko a couple of times now so I was actually surprised to realize that I hadn&#39;t reviewed it yet. I really love this small restaurant. Like so many places I eat out at in the city it feels really cozy with nice lighting and exposed brick walls. There isn&#39;t a ton of seating so if you have a big group you&#39;ll probably want to make reservations, but I&#39;ve never had trouble getting a table for two during the weekdays just by walking in.The beer and wine selection is so small there isn&#39;t a menu you just say you&#39;d like red or white wine and your server can tell you your two choices. However, the service is really on top of things and that&#39;s quite nice.We usually end up ordering mostly sushi rolls and a couple pieces of fish and everything is always really fresh. I like that there is some creativity in certain rolls and I&#39;d say my favorite roll that I&#39;ve had so far is the dragon roll because it has a fairly spicy sauce that comes with it. But, I&#39;ve never tried anything I didn&#39;t enjoy here so I think it&#39;s a safe bet no matter what you&#39;re ordering.

I reserve 5 stars for places that are consistently good and raise the bar. The freshness of the fish is obvious with each dish. The dishes are simple but full of flavor. This is not the place to come if you are looking for crazy sushi rolls. This is the place for classic, delicious dishes.My go to items are the tempura udon, forty-niner, maguro and butterfish sashimi and wakame salad. This combo hits the spot for two people. Try it!!

Well, it doesn&#39;t have Unagi don for lunch and Chirashi was $30.00. Definitely not cheap and the price was different from what it showed online. I got a seat at sushi bar. The sushi chef was super nice and friendly. And cute :P. The 49er roll was so yummy. I love the hint of pepper flavor in it. And big big thumbs up for lemon slices. It&#39;s a great place for date, but not for working lunch especially when your lunch break is only half hour :(

I&#39;m gonna give this place 5 stars for its 1 free order of sake for my friends bday which was on the waiter. that was pretty cool! We came in around 7 but like the waiter said they already doublebooked another group at 8 but we could still get seated. however, in the end they cancelled which was pretty good. This place is great for groups/parties of more than 4. Definitely really pretty but small area to sit! Our waiter was really nice and he came by often to refill water and serve. We ordered mostly rolls-dynamite-dragon-rainbow-firecracker (pretty spicy!)-volcanoe (it literally looked like a volcanoe with little deep fried pieces like tempura)-cucumber salad (my favorite!)-tempura-spider-2 udon beefI thought all the rolls were DELICIOUS! The fish was sooo fresh! I also liked how they didn&#39;t overly deep fry the firecracker, it was crispy and just right. We shared all these and were pretty full. oh and the sake was good! It got really busy around 8.The decor was pretty and dim. It had a nice ambience to it. It&#39;s close to subway! (the sandwich shop).Another star for fast service, and for desert we had- kona coffee mochi-green tea ice creamthe kona coffee was a bit icy. it was alright. i liked the green tea ice cream though. $4 a pop.

Decent sushi, but for what you will pay, you can get way better in SF. The biggest issue I had with this place was the staff / manager. Read other reviews and you will get the gist. Pompous, rude, unaccommodating, unprofessional. We nearly walked out of the place a few times and now I wish we had. Go to Ryoko instead. Cool space, great sushi, and sweet people that make you feel welcome.

Eh, not particularly impressed. Nice ambiance, with tons of gorgeous oil paintings on the walls. Seems like reservations are mandatory if you want to come here for dinner. Service is a bit slow, and they serve each &#34;course&#34; one by one, slowly. My sister and I ordered two rolls to share and seaweed salad. We waited awhile for the salad, and gobbled that up. And then we had to wait awhile before the waiter came and took away our plates and then a few more minutes for our rainbow roll. Gobbled that up right away - and then again, we had to wait for our dishes to be cleared, and then it took forever for our volcano roll to come.In terms of the quality of the food: the sushi was fine; the fish is fresh. The rainbow roll wasn&#39;t anything spectacular. The wasabi could be A LOT hotter. The volcano roll was good, but too much tempura on top of it, not enough roll.

Surprisingly good find in an unsuspecting location. Unsuspecting, in that, you don&#39;t normally find anything too great around Union Sq.Past the hustle and bustle of Claude Lane, keep an eye open for the little store front on the corner of the next alley or no doubt, you will walk right by.Prices of the freshly-flown-in special were slightly off-putting (~2x the regular menu offerings of nigiri/sashimi), but certainly were more unusual options, including a variety of crustaceans not often seen frequenting sushi bars in SF.Beyond the expected offerings, the remainder was categorized by cooking style: grilled or fried and a slew of combo dinners and noodle dishes.Oshitashi was light, flavorful and a perfect starter.Gyoza, steamed and grilled, were delicate and some of the better I&#39;ve had.Saba (mackerel) is an enormously flavorful fish on its own. The grilled dish (shio-yaki) may have hit the heat for a few seconds too long, but the flavor was all present, garnishes aside. I&#39;d opt for basic saba nigiri next time.Sake novice, I normally skip it or opt for a Japanese beer, but it was a celebration dinner and we ended up with two bottles.Dinner for two, pre-tip, came to $60; incredibly reasonable considering the sake.Ambiance is a fusion of classy-contemporary-trendy-borderline romantic. It&#39;s whatever you want it to be - catching up with an old friend or a date, it works. Just leave the group outing for another time.Service was extremely attentive, water glasses always filled and dishes brought promptly.Reservations? Win win.I&#39;d not hesitate to go back if I&#39;m looking for an option in this neighborhood.Arigato gozaimasu

This place is literally a hidden gem -- I walked by it three times and didn&#39;t even notice it, due to it being overshadowed by the Irish bank.But sadly, it wasn&#39;t the hidden gem I wanted to discover -- the food was subpar at best.I got the highly anticipated Volcano Roll, which did look like a volcano! The sushi were stacked in four rows of two and looked like a volcano. The salmon skin, green onions, and spicy sauce were splattered on top of the sushi and around the bowl, like lava. The best part of that dish, was the salmon skin, which was crisp and not too oily. The sauce had a hint of spice with it, but also some sweetness to it as well. The roll itself just reminded me of any other spicy fish roll with avocado.I really really really liked their gyozas though! Instead of the normal pork gyoza, it had shrimp and scallions in it! The shrimp was sweet and you can definitely tell it was fresh upon each bite. I liked how the skin of the gyoza wasn&#39;t crazy deep fried, and was thin enough to not overshadow the yummy goodness inside.Also got the chicken teriyaki with tempura. Tempura had too much batter and tasted like the outside of an onion ring. Chicken teriyaki was nothing special as well. Didn&#39;t think it was worth $18 for 8 pieces of tempura (2 shrimp, 5 veggies) and a slab of chicken teriyaki.FUNNIEST THING THOUGH: was celebrating my friend&#39;s birthday, and for her birthday dessert, they put one of those trick candles that won&#39;t blow out unless you dose it with water! I thought that was pretty unique, but they also charged us for the birthday dessert so that&#39;s a no go. Also, their azuki ice cream tasted like melon....weird.

I was very excited to go to this restaurant and try it out! I am a huge sashimi and sushi fan and went for my birthday lunch.I was disappointed by the food :/ I ordered the chef&#39;s special sashimi and it was ok. I expected better :(The restaurant was very cute and great for a date.Also the service was just ok (but the hostess was great!). Me and my 2 girl friends were eating next to a couple that was treated significantly better because they were spending a lot of money on food and alcohol. I understand they want to please big spenders but it was to the point that we felt like we were not even there.Recap: I was super excited to try this place out and I thought I would like it very much but that was not the case :/

Ordered mackerel, beef and one roll, bill was over $80! Overpriced and average flavors. Service, not terrible but not great. When the father owned this restaurant the quality and portions for the price were much better. I wanted to place an order to go, while dining, for my co-worker and was told they don&#39;t do takeout (?). Portions were so skimpy I had to buy lunch again later at L&amp;L - a much better value for the money. I won&#39;t be returning to Akikos.

Went here for a cozy dinner during a work trip just in time - my regular sushi craving was just starting to nag me. First, I thought it was great that although the place was small they were happy to take reservations. The restaurant is cozy and cool, especially at dinnertime, with candlelight bouncing off the brick walls.We ordered a bunch of rolls to share for the table and I for one left satisfied and happy. From what I can remember, my favorite was the volcano roll, the pieces piled high and doused with crunchy tempura pieces. Heaven!The server was friendly but a bit slow. Our rolls came out sporadically, so we were always going, &#39;is that everything?&#39; He also forgot our edamame but he was good at keeping our glasses filled.I&#39;m glad to have found a non-fast food sushi joint downtown for the next trip to SF!

This spot is quite the gem in the middle between the Financial District and the edge of Downtown SF. There are two locations and this is the best one! It is far from being a whole in the wall; though it&#39;s hard to find. The quality of the sushi and sashimi is so fresh. The tempura is fried to perfection. I almost feel like I&#39;m in a small Japanese sushi house.

Just went back last week after Ricky&#39;s departure and shocked at the crappy service and new chef&#39;s lack of professionalism. Sitting at the bar for omakase, the service was nonexistent; our plates were piling up next to us like we were eating at a sushi-go-round restaurant. New Chef kept asking us what we wanted after only 6 pieces of sushi. It&#39;s OMAKASE, keep the food coming until we ask to stop. Also, new omakase had no sashimi nor hot food unlike previous times. The chef also practically threw the sushi plate at us with one hand. I&#39;ve never experience such horrendous omakase experience. For over $100/person meal, this place is a RIPOFF! DONT GO! My friends and I will NEVER come back.

It&#39;s a decent place, they handled our last minute reservation for 12 people (!) with great ease. It looks like the seafood udon was good, however I opted for the nigiri sampler. I found the shari (rice bottom) to be really inadequate but the fish was fresh. For me, sushi is an &#34;experience&#34;, so even though fresh fish is often hard to get, it&#39;s a real buzzkill when the rice does not work with it. They also have creative rolls but they&#39;re a little pricey.It&#39;s nice that the sushi guy is always the same. That&#39;s something you don&#39;t get everywhere, either.At any rate, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll come back to this place on purpose, it doesn&#39;t blow me away. Well, maybe when Yo&#39;s Sushi Club closes and I get desperate, maybe. (Yo&#39;s is a great example of a place that does wonderful things with fish that isn&#39;t necessarily top quality.)

Wonderful meal at Akiko&#39;s! Many ingredients are imported from Japan. The rolls are OK, but the Nigiri is where it&#39;s at. Have a seat at the bar and let the sushi chefs create whatever they want for you. (I think I got several off-menu items) You will rake up a large bill doing so, but it&#39;s worth it for at least once in your life :) I have to say I never have had real sushi until now. They taste other-wordly and just melt in your mouth. I wish I were a millionaire so I could eat here every day.

Great stuff. As good as it gets compared to qualities that I have had in Hokkaido. I mean, the store cryogenically freezes the ankimo, otoro and wagyu beef. For a restaurant of that size that is willing to invest in a deep freeze chamber, it speaks lots about the amount of integrity it is putting into the food it serves.Definitely get botan ebi if you have a chance. Very hard to get ones that are as fresh if not in season. The Kin-Medai and the Aka matsu are also great selections.Although the other things on the menu are good, you should fork out the money and do omakase. That&#39;s the jewel of this place. Great find.

Meh.Needed a place to meet up with friends while in the city before racing to the airport, and wanted sushi. Inserted all those factors into the yelp-o-meter and out came Akiko.I easily made reservations on OpenTable for 4 at 6:30 and when we got there we were seated quickly.Their menu is not that large, as compared to other sushi places. Also as others have said, pricing is out of wack.Not like I can suggest another sushi place in the area, but I wouldn&#39;t go back. The food was tasty and decently portioned but not mind-blowing. The decor and service was also not memorable. I&#39;m betting that there HAS to be something better in the area.

Totally uncertain how to rate Akiko&#39;s. Ate here with my good friend who is a regular here. Splurged even though we weren&#39;t on an expense account that night. Had the Omakase and was quoted between $110-120/person.Food: 4 stars - some exceptional fish flown in from varous parts of the world. 1/2 the sushi was really great and special. However, the other 1/2 was solid and I liked it, but they were some of the imported fish so the prices for the okay ones were like $20-25+ for 2 pieces. A few of the basic pieces like salmon was really good. We also got a young hamachi cheek (kama) and although tasty barely had meat.Service: 5 stars - great service all around. Friendly, engaging service.Quality to Pricing (Value): 3 stars - part of the issue I had was some parts of the omakase fish was only okay and not worth the price. The bill came out to $300 for 2 and we only had a few bottles of beer and no expensive sake either. I have been to some of the best sushi/Japanese restaurants around some major cities and I really felt this was overpriced by 50%. Akiko&#39;s caters to those with an expense account.I will come back, but just not order the Omakase anymore. Too many of the Yelp reviews recommended the Omakase. Go for it if you are on expense account, and investment banker, venture capitalist or just sold your tech company. Otherwise, if you stick to a la carte standard sushi/sashimi, then it will be a great experience with good service, at a small, intimate place.

For now, I&#39;ll go to Kiki&#39;s - but when I just can&#39;t take cheap fish anymore, Akiko&#39;s here I come.

This is my go-to sushi spot in the city when I want good quality fresh fish. I have come here several times in the past year and it has yet to disappoint me. What I love about their menu, is that they change it according to whichever is the fresh catch of the day. I&#39;ve had their Chirashi-don and a good assortment of their Nigiri. Also, the Volcano roll is absolutely to die for as everyone here has already written; it&#39;s got a good kick of flavor+spice to really appease those taste buds. This place is certainly not cheap though, so expect to pay at least 20 dollars on your tab. ;)Oh, and it is HIGHLY advised to reserve your seating prior arrival. It makes their job seating you easier and you have less waiting to do.

Came here for a quick dinner with friends. The sushi selection looked impressive but I wasn&#39;t really in the mood to splurge, so I had their combo dinner instead. I got the 4pc nigiri with tonkatsu. Portion was slightly on the smaller side considering the price was $19. Sushi quality was decent, but didn&#39;t blow my mind. It&#39;s kind of in the limbo between cheap low quality sushi and expensive high quality sushi, which isn&#39;t something I usually go for.

Ate here for lunch today and stoked I did--this place is awesome! Hard to believe I have not eaten here in the 14 years since I moved here from Japan. They do amazing omakase, Edo-mae style. The house cured ikura was among the best I have had anywhere, and best in SF for sure. Also noteworthy were the aburi-kinmedai, aburi-akamutsu and ocean trout which was served with shiso between the rice and fish. Finally, the uni (from Maine) was delicious. When we were leaving the chef showed us that they have fresh hairy crabs from Hokkaido which are in season. Can&#39;t wait to return for dinner and eat me some hairy crabs!!!

This place is one of the best, if not the best, sushi places I&#39;ve been to. As a sushi-lover, I&#39;ve gone to a fair share of sushi restaurants but this one tops it all.The different, unique types of sashimi they have are heavenly and fit all tastes. You can tell the chef and the servers are genuinely happy to work there and share their love of their food. Our server recommended the best fish and when they were out of the ones we chose, gave us alternatives that were delicious. The service is amazing and the ambience is very relaxed and welcoming. Definitely a place you should try for all true sushi lovers.

Let&#39;s see, where to begin...I&#39;ll start with the good.Pros:-Love the location as it&#39;s close to the FiDi which makes it convenient for a weekday dinner-Nice plateware, which I read on their website is from Heath Ceramics-Miso soup - one of the better miso soups I&#39;ve had in Japanese Restaurants-Friendly sushi chef, although when we talked about some other Japanese restaurants we eat at/have been to, he talked some smack about each place, which I didn&#39;t think was entirely professionalNow onto why I give these place 2 stars: Given the rave reviews on Yelp, I was sorely disappointed with this place. The night didn&#39;t start well, as I had an 8 PM reservation, which the server had given away because they only hold tables 15 minutes after the reserved time. My friend and I were at the restaurant by 8:10 PM by my watch, and my watch is always 1-2 minutes faster. Luckily a party at the sushi bar was just finishing up so we didn&#39;t wait too long for seats at the sushi bar.I knew this place would be pricey given its location, but seriously, the portions here are tiny! Slices of sashimi and nigiri were super thin and I couldn&#39;t help but thinking why they were being so stingy. I mean, I wouldn&#39;t mind if pieces are small, but super fresh, but I was incredibly underwhelmed by the quality of fish here.I ordered the chirashi ($17) and there were some pretty stringy fish in the mix I got that I really had to tear through. I do think he gave me more pieces than normal though, because this portion was relatively reasonable compared to everything else we ordered.My friend ordered the sashimi and saba dinner combo ($21), which came with miso soup and rice. Wow I tried some of the saba, and it was definitely either overcooked or an old piece of saba. Dry and completely unmemorable. Also super tiny - portions were about palm size.Ankimo ($8) is served nigiri style, and wrapped in seaweed. This was actuall pretty good, but tiny portions.Oshitashi ($3) good, but standard.We were still hungry so decided to order an order of the hamachi belly ($8 for 2 pieces of nigiiri), thinking maybe individual orders of nigiri might be better. Wow, what a mistake! Another underwhelming dish. There was absolutely no wow factor, nothing spectacular, tasted squishy....I was utterly disappointed.I wanted to like this place, I really did. It&#39;s so convenient and the sushi chef was friendly, but at these prices and this kind of quality, I just can&#39;t justify a reason to come back. What a shame :(

Best selection ever.Never have I been to a sushi bar that has a better selection of rare, sustainably caught fish.We opted for Omakase and were treated to one of the best sushi meals I&#39;ve ever eaten. This is now my favorite sushi bar and I will make a point to visit every time I come back to town. It&#39;s pricey, but oh so worth it.

When I first walked in I was a little turned off by the &#34;whaddayawant?&#34; casual service, but after they took my order everything was attentive.And then the Ika (Calamari) came... And I instantly loved this place. The squid was cooked perfectly and breaded lightly. The spicy garlic aioli sauce it was sprinkled with just hit all the right notes for me.I also tried a Volcano Roll and it did not disappoint. Gordon Ramsey would throw a fit over how much garnish is piled on these, but they tasted great. I had a huge pile of Tempura flakes left on my plate afterward though.I&#39;ll be going there again next time I visit SF!

We came here for a friend&#39;s birthday and enjoyed it.This Japanese restaurant is great for small parties of 5 to 10 people. The dim lighted atmosphere gives it a nice feel and complements the art on their walls. On the one hand you have great sushi, sashimi and delicious Japanese appetizers. On the other hand, I wish that restaurants disclosed more details in their menu&#39;s on the type of fish they&#39;re using. Farmed? Wild? Type of Salmon? Type of Tuna? These are beneficial to know.Parking is a bit tough to find as it is with any restaurant that&#39;s located close to financial district and doesn&#39;t have private parking.

In order to spice up this review, I&#39;m going to intersperse it with fun TRIVIA FACTS! Watch out!---Super classy sushi place. But it&#39;s not, like, IN YOUR FACE classy, which I appreciated. Low-key classy. It won&#39;t get all up in your business.**TRIVIA FACT**I think you need to get reservations here but I don&#39;t actually know because I didn&#39;t get them for my group.***Things are kind of pricey, especially if you stick to the sashimi or nigiri. I guess that&#39;s how it is at most sushi places---but since this is a more upscale joint, you can drop, like, 25 bucks on what basically amounts to two small slices of fish.***TRIVIA FACT***The bathroom door is kind of confusing. You&#39;ll... you&#39;ll see what I mean?***Service was glacially slow. We were famished, and waiting for sushi, and really really wanted to eat sushi, and waited a little bit more for sushi, and then the sushi came. It&#39;s something you&#39;ll just have to deal with. Highlights at our table were the salmon nigiri and the volcano rolls.***TRIVIA FACT***My recollection of the price is a bit biased in the expensive direction because we were paying for the dinner of one of our friends who was going away, and because I have no ability to account for cognitive biases.***The rolls are actually a pretty good bang for your buck. If I come back, I&#39;ll definitely be getting more of those.***TRIVIA FACT***That&#39;s all! I&#39;m done now.***

Yum! I love this place. You need a reservation to get in.They do simple, delicious, clean, fresh sushi. Not overloaded on any sauces or no cream cheese in sushi (eww what a gross idea...).Their fish was ultra fresh, the service amazing. There was one waiter who was mainly tasked with making sure the water was always full in our glasses the whole night, and another waiter who took our orders. It was a lot of attention!I don&#39;t want to review highly because other people will crowd this place out, but I simply can&#39;t say anything bad about this place.

I&#39;m always happy to see Akiko&#39;s hopping with business, even if this means I wont be able to get a table during peak hours. This family owned and operated business is on the short list of my all time favorites. Any haters need to meet me for a boxing lesson, your choice of venue.After not being in for sometime, I can walk through the door, be recognized and welcomed back. I took my kids to lunch here today; sashimi for me with wakame, assorted rolls and tempura for the rest. It was the usual outstanding service and quality food and usual here is why I like coming here so much.Akiko&#39;s is simply the best sushi downtown.

Our favorite sushi place near home in Chinatown. The fish is exceptional, though the nigiri portions are not large. Rolls are delicious and a great value, and the secret standouts are Oshitashi appetizer and volcano roll.- Make a reservation (OpenTable or call them) - they frequently fill up completely- Everything is fresh and wonderful- Try the Walu both ways (seared and raw)- Sit at the bar, the chefs are adorable- Their wine list is my #1 source for newfound favs- Pull hard on the bathroom door to overcome the wind tunnel&#39;s effect. You&#39;ll see.

Had an early reservation made with OpenTable, running late, pushed it back 45 minutes (I thought) got there and wasn&#39;t on the list. Realized when I changed the reservation I actually moved it to the following evening accidentally (I&#39;ll blame jet lag). But the waiter/host found us a table and sat us right away. Made a potentially disastrous mistake absolutely fine.Food was spectacular. I&#39;m from Buffalo, NY, I have some sushi places back home I adore, but this has totally recalibrated my scale for rating sushi restaurants. I knew the seafood would be fresher, but I wasn&#39;t prepared for how good this was going to be. I honestly don&#39;t know if I&#39;ll ever enjoy sushi the same way again.Started with gyoza, wife had chicken teriyaki and some unagi nigiri. I had a spicy tuna roll and their 49er roll. The spicy tuna was legitimately hot with super fresh tuna inside. The 49er roll had a bunch of stuff in it including really crunchy shrimp tempura and was topped with a sliver of paper lemon peel. That lemon peel just made the roll pop and made my eyes bug out of my head when I ate the first piece. Wife was worried something was wrong by my reaction. When she tried a piece she understood. Wow.Also, their wasabi had more kick than any I&#39;ve ever had.Was worried about slow service based on other reviews, but it was very speedy. Maybe they were trying to speed us through since we were an unplanned table, but the service was impeccable, not slow, not rushed, and water frequently refilled. Space was really inviting, attractive, and hip.

Dare I say this is the best sushi I&#39;ve ever had? Hmmmm. Without question it&#39;s the best sushi rolls I&#39;ve had in a couple years. This was my first visit to a Japanese restaurant where literally every roll satisfied me in some way. The Firecracker, VV, Volcano, and Dragon were especially phenom. Of the eight rolls we had, I think the Dynamite and Spider Roll were the least favorable.The decor is also super cute: floral designs along with bamboo. Service was a bit slow in the beginning and I think they could&#39;ve been a little more attentive when pouring beers, but overall I was highly satisfied with the experience. Even on weekdays - we went on a Wednesday - I recommend reservations. It&#39;s in a central area on Bush and Grant so there&#39;s popular street activity. Sitting up front, I saw a lot of people turned away because they were walk-ins. Also, sit in the back! The front tables got a little chilly (though I also take blame for being a bit underdressed based on SF August weather).I think based on the quantity of pieces in each roll, this place is also very reasonably priced: 8 rolls, an app, glass of wine, and prob 6 bottles of Sapporo for $155. So happyyyy!

The trick to having a great experience here is twofold:The first part is when you come. It&#39;s not hard to get a reservation here, but peak hours can be troublesome: The layout can make it hard to get your server&#39;s attention. Service, however is often fantastic, seldom sporadic. Come right after or before peak hours.The second is what you order. Stick to anything where the chef chooses what&#39;s fresh, ie sashimi platters or chirashi. Order off the daily menu. Sure, it&#39;s a little more expensive but Akiko&#39;s has the best sashimi I&#39;ve ever had.Tonkatsu is good, as are the teriyaki dishes. The firecracker roll is great and the nigiri des are often so good I will order one and try it and immediately order another.PS, the 2 seat table in the front may be the most romantic spot I&#39;ve ever had the pleasure of dining.

I came here with an old-coworker because we were craving good sushi and it was paycheck day (YAY!)I definitely recommend making reservations for this place because on the night we went was &#34;reservation only&#34; night. The interior of the restaurant is very rustic and cozy, decorated very nicely.We had ordered a variety of nigiri with fish other than sake (salmon) and maguro (tuna) and a few hot dishes that I can&#39;t seem to recall. Everything tasted delicious. The only thing that concerned me and that I&#39;d to warn everyone is the spicy tuna roll. It looked like a harmless spicy tuna roll but each bite was packed with a PUNCH. Unless you really like spicy food and have a high tolerance for it, this is the roll for you. The burn for each bite last for a good 10 min and there were at least 8 pieces in the roll. At the end of our meal, we asked the waiter what made it so spicy. He told us that it&#39;s made with habanero peppers. Imagine our faces: -___________-I wish the restaurant had mentioned that on their menus.

i&#39;m writing this review so late.i went here i think around august (i forgot somewhere around that time).since i don&#39;t really remember what i ordered, this place didn&#39;t wowed me. the part i would remember would be the price is on the pricey side for the portion and quality. the rolls were o-k. if i remember correctly, the fish i think was not fishy, which is good. the appetizers i ordered didn&#39;t really wowed me either, we had agedashi tofu and the fried ika, it was nothing special to me. this 3 star rating is really for the price and the portion and the most part, food was not that memorable for my tastebuds. I have very high expectations for sushi, and this place was just ok. i would probably rather order chirashi sushi here rather than rolls.*this review is strictly based on the food

When the bill came they had charged $12 for almost each 2 piece of sushi. I really felt like I was being gang raped that evening. A tourist trap and a place for YUPs who have no clue about sushi or Japanese culture. Some of the reviews I read have to be fake!

Akiko&#39;s Sushi is a great sushi place in downtown SF. The employees were great, very friendly and very helpful. They introduced me to some versions of tuna I&#39;ve never tried before that was buttery and fantastic. The decor in the back room is cool and overall, it&#39;s a definite place to try again. Very good place for a quick meal and if you have time, make sure to ask about what special items they are currently offering. It seems that they pride themselves on unique and hard to find items that set them apart from the others.CheersPosted to Yelp via the coolest new App from the iTunes App Store called @TongueTango Appyoutu.be/CGFlmQ5ruTMyoutu.be/r0Yvw7jRYHM

Having asked a number of people who worked around Union Square and most everyone saying there wasn&#39;t any good or reasonably priced Sushi in the area I decided to turn to yelp and found some good reviews of Akiko&#39;s. We walked from Union Square and finally found Akiko under and old Irish Pub sign.The Sushi was wonderful and the Sushi chef was excellent. They actually had real Wasabi which I had never tried, not near as hot as you standard green horseradish, but very yummy.All in all one of the better Sushi restaurants I&#39;ve ever been to. We will visiting whenever we make a trip to Union Square.

I&#39;m gonna share one of my sushi strategies with all y&#39;all: Order anyting that has anything to do with a volcano, hot lava or any kind of explosives.At Akiko&#39;s, I&#39;d say that strategy was a hit. Out of the many, many maki that my group ordered, the Volcano Roll, Firecracker Roll and Dynamite Roll were my favorites. Some of the others were slightly less exciting for me, but that&#39;s not to say they were disappointing. I didn&#39;t try a single thing I didn&#39;t like.I would have liked to taste some of the sashimi, but since I was with a big group, it didn&#39;t make as much sense. And speaking of groups, definitely make a reservation if you are coming with a crew. The restaurant is cozy, in a raw kind of way---with some cool murals on the exposed brick.

Little did he know that I&#39;ve already tried this place and was planning to bring HIM here for a surprise. -___-The food was as good as the first time I tried this place, although the service wasn&#39;t as wonderful. We ordered the Volcano Roll, the Rainbow Roll, and the Fourty-Niner. Our server wasn&#39;t too friendly, but he was quite knowledgeable.Everything was very fresh and carefully prepared, so again, I was impressed. I highly recommend the Rainbow Roll.

Excellent sushi, so-so service. Started out a bit bumpy - we had reservations, but waited about 10 minutes to be seated, so not the end of the world. Got seated and waited about another 10 minutes to really get anything going. I wasn&#39;t feeling particularly good about things. The guys working there (all I saw working there were guys which was a bit odd to me in a restaurant like this) seemed a bit overwhelmed/disorganized considering how small the place is. The earbuds they wear to communicate didn&#39;t seem to be helping - perhaps that&#39;s the problem, they can&#39;t get anything accomplished with each other in their ears.Anyway, things turned around after that. The food was excellent. Rivaled my favorite sushi place in Seattle. From then on everything was delicious and came to the table in a timely fashion. The anal-retentive positioning of things on the table and attention to presentation was commendable, but perhaps part of the reason they seem to have issues with quick service.Overall, excellent food and a nice little restaurant despite the bumpy beginning. I&#39;d be back again and again if I lived nearby.

Atmosphere is great. We sat at the bar and it was casual, fun, yet still a little trendy and upscale (compared to your hole in the wall cheap sushi places).

I&#39;ve been looking to try this place for a pretty long time and finally got the chance. The restaurant was a pretty hard to find considering there was no signage, but I ended up poking my head in and seeing the sushi bar in front. The ambiance was quaint and pretty nice.Being that it was my first time there, I went with my staple items of nigiri along with a couple hosomakis. Saba, ikura, shiromaguro, spicy scallop, and a negihama, and sake maki for the rolls, while my friend ordered Uni, seared Sake,and hamachi . The fish was very fresh considering it was Monday (hit or miss day for sushi bars with fish companies being closed on weekends - ex sushi chef). I was especially impressed with their saba (well cured), along with their ikura (one of the few places that marinades their roe). You can usually tell how much pride and effort a japanese restaurant takes from their saba, tamago, and ikura (all time consuming preparations). One thing about their sake maki was their method of curing the salmon. Salmon&#39;s one of my favorite fishes, but I&#39;m not particularly fond of using Kombu for the marinade, it makes it taste almost like smoked salmon (dislike, unless it&#39;s on a bagel).All in all, I&#39;m glad I found this place because I can only take so much Tokyo Express. Not bashing on TE, but they&#39;re a different class. I&#39;ll definitely be back, hopefully for dinner with a couple bottles of Sake!

This is by far the BEST sushi restaurant in the city that I have come across yet. And I will update my yelp reviews if I find something better. The fish is fresh and tasty. The rolls are phenomenal. The service could be friendlier and more accommodating however you can get past it once you receive your dish. The restaurant is small and space is limited so call for a reservation!

Best sushi in the city! Just be warned that after eating here you won&#39;t be able to eat sushi anywhere else because they set the bar real high here. Do yourself a favor and make a reservation now!Bring friends!!!

Good sushi, not really blowing me out of the water, though. It&#39;s located in tourist-y land here by Union Square so no matter what I feel like you&#39;re going to get high prices and mediocre food in this 5-block radius, unless you REALLY want to fork over top dollar. I&#39;d go there again if I was dying for sushi and in the &#39;hood.Service was really, really slow and they brought out our food in a very random order. It took 15 minutes to get a cup of tea. Maybe it&#39;s our fault for picking the 12:00 rush spot, but for 3 of us our lunch lasted an hour and a half... don&#39;t pick this spot if you&#39;re in a hurry.I had udon soup, and it was good. Had a couple rolls which were ok. One was over-done and so gigantic I could barely fit a bite in my mouth and the other one was painfully average. The sashimi was fresh and probably my favorite part of the meal.

I&#39;m a bit conflicted; the rolls were the low point of the meal. We got the volcano, a sort of fried crab leg dish and the vv. I thought the volcano was way overpricedand over hyped. To be honest I couldnt even tell there was fried crab in it, it could have just been fry batter. The vv was just ok. The fried crab leg thing was a distinctive taste but I didn&#39;t particularly care for it.The nigiri was the better of the night, I enjoyed the diverse selection and tried some things out of my comfort zone. So that was good.The service is very slow but attentive when they&#39;re there.

The food is top-notch at this restaurant. The sushi is very fresh and well-prepared, and the tonkatsu chicken was cooked to perfection. Even their regular sake is the best I&#39;ve tried in a long time. However, I agree with previous reviewers in that Akiko&#39;s service is slow, hence the one-star deduction. It took 15-20 minutes for our food to be served at lunch time on a Monday. Kind of ridiculous. I can only imagine what it&#39;s like at dinner.In short, as long as you&#39;re in the area and not starving, I definitely recommend this place.

This is the best sushi place in SF. I give this place a five stars because of the good food this place got. I came here for dinner with my friends and I was introduced to whole new varieties of fish. I was never a fan of salmon but Akiko&#39;s salmon is so fresh here. All of their sashmi are really fresh! I&#39;ve almost tried some of the rolls here as wells. And the best rolls of them all is the Firecracker! This roll is so good,its like putting fire in your mouth. Oh yeah, their salmon roll are pretty good here too. The California roll here are made of real crab meat which is really good. OH! Their hand rolls are really good here. Man, let&#39;s just say this place got great foods!!I would definitely come back here for the fresh sashmi!!I would recommend the tuna salad, salmon rolls, and if you guys like spicy food then the Firecracker is the best!

This is one of the better sushi restaurants I&#39;ve been to in the city. The place isn&#39;t huge, and I&#39;d strongly recommend making a reservation so you can get right in. My friends and I started with a bottle of cold sake, and ordered some edamame and a bunch of rolls. I&#39;d suggest the following rolls to order as they were extremely delicious:-spicy tuna-firecracker-49er rollWe also ordered a couple other basic rolls and everything was really good. This place does fresh fish well, and didn&#39;t disappoint. The sushi chef was friendly and said goodbye to us when we walked out feeling quite satisfied.Prices were very decent with rolls ranging from $6-$16 or so.

3.5 stars1.5 stars taken off due to subpar sashimi and no house tea being served with dinner.Love the interior of this place. A bit cramped but the vibe and modernity of the place stands out. I got 3 things: the 49er roll, the rainbow roll, and the 6 piece sashimi (2 types of &amp; salmon). This is not one of those places with insanely good sashimi, but at the price point, I did not expect that. The creativity and flavor of the 2 &#34;non traditional&#34; rolls was fantastic. The 49er roll was the better of the two and one I highly recommend. The rainbow roll was truly colorful, as rainbow rolls are supposed to be but are often not, and was also delicious. I highly recommend this place for a sushi fix and a nice ambiance, but don&#39;t expect world class sashimi.

I absolutely love this place!This place is owned by the head sushi chef and his wife, who also works there. It&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve last come here but everything on the menu is delicious. Modern sushi restaurant with an old style feel. Sit at the sushi bar if you want the freshest cuts and chat up the sushi chef. The tables around the restaurant offer cozy seating.The fish is always fresh and the service is great. The Volcano roll is so yummy and their udons and other dishes are just as good as the sushi. They work really quickly to get you your food as fast as possible. This place is on the smaller side so for all those in the financial district or visiting the area, I would recommend coming before or after peak dining times.If you work in the neighborhood and are looking for a quick sushi fix, i would definitely recommend this place. Usually I don&#39;t like to order to go sushi or take sushi home because it gets all soggy and unfresh tasting, but the take out here is amazing. It&#39;s as fresh as if you were eating at the restaurant. YUM !- jenn

I loved this place!!While on the smaller side, it&#39;s a perfect place for a date or friend reunion. It&#39;s warm and cozy and decor is friendly. Yes, decor can be described that way.What&#39;s even better is that the food is good and the prices are decent. I thought I&#39;d blow my wallet on sushi downtown, but actually I did not! The Firecracker roll was only around $12, and it was a big portion of sushi. I couldn&#39;t really breathe after eating it because it was so spicy but that was fine. Friends got delicious rolls as well (lion king, etc.).Would definitely come here again!The only downside is there is no large sign (or at least I didn&#39;t notice one) outside so I thought the place didn&#39;t exist for a while...

This is a sushi resaurant that even adventurous sushi lovers will find something new to try and enjoy. The fish here is esecially fresh and you can find items on the menu that you will not find in most other sushi restaurants. Tokujyo Uni (Russian uni from Kaigara Island), Madai (wild black sea bream), Ji-Kinmedai (cold-smoked golden eye snapper) and Nama Sake (first-run wild copper salmon) were all on the menu during our visit and each piece was ethereal. Our server was an excellent guide through the menu and was very knowledgeable about each item. The sake list is also well-curated. The restaurant is very small, so reservations are highly recommended. We had the best table in the house up front by the window. The main part of the restaurant in the back is very tight and a bit claustrophobic with no windows. You also have to deal with everyone walking thru the narrow passage behind your table to get to the restroom. Ideally, secure a table up front or at the sushi bar. We did go with our 7 and 10 year old kids, and they were able to find items on the menu that they liked as they are used to us dragging them out to good places to eat, but there is no kids menu, and I would recommend not bringing children if they are in any way picky eaters. I would definitely like to dine here again on my next trip to SF.

This was among the most delicious and extravagant sushi experiences of my San Francisco sushi-eating career. Everything was absolutely extraordinary -- fresh, delicious, beautifully presented. I tend to dine around the middle of the sushi price scale: not too high, not too low. I don&#39;t have the stomach for bad sushi, but I don&#39;t have the money for really expensive sushi. But when a friend rolled into town and wanted to try &#34;the best sushi in San Francisco,&#34; I did a little research and came up with this place.Three of us came for lunch, and sat at a table in the back. We each asked for the 10 piece nigiri combo, and were treated to a fabulous presentation and recitation bye Alan, our attentive, but somewhat officious, waiter. Our meal was delivered in waves, with each two-space to 3-piece delivery being explicated and described in detail, along with origins, comparisons, and dipping instructions. Actually, it was a bit overbearing, but it appeared to be the style of the place to super-control how each piece was consumed.In the end, it really was one of the most delicious sushi dining experiences in recent memory. On the other hand, it was also one of the most expensive: $460 for three people to eat lunch, and I Could easily have eaten twice as much. The price is the only thing that kept this from being a 5-star rating.Thank God my friend paid!Points of interest:Cloth napkins -- definitely a plus!Excellent sushi rice -- perfect temperature and consistency.Extremely attentive waitstaff.Every single piece was truly extraordinary!If you ever have a chance to go on someone else&#39;s dime, do it!

This place in NOT easy to find, but FIND IT. Look for the address number 431, there is a sign for the Irish Restaurant above Akiko&#39;s. I went there with my wife, sister, and full blooded Japanese mother, if she approves, you know it&#39;s good. We shared a couple of cucumber salads to start, excellent, a little real crab in it, ad a touch of dressing. Mom has the combo nigiri plate, I had beef teriyaki, and nigiri, sis had tempura, wife had 5 pc. toro nigiri. Everything was the best in San Francisco by far. I will recommend this place to everyone I know, and I will go here whenever I am in the city. Make reservations, it is a small, and busy place. The sushi rice was not too gummy, and just a little rice on the sashimi, more fish than rice, that&#39;s the way it is supposed to be. Mom was in sushi heaven. I would give it 3 $$$ not two, but it&#39;s worth the extra $

i hardly EVER write review updates. instead i usually just add onto my previous statement unless something changed. and something did change!!last time i came here, i might have gotten food poisoning. im not pointing fingers but very high probability. i also ordered their rolls. and was very disappointed that almost every roll that i ordered was fried/cooked.anyway, this time i came during lunch on the company dollar. we ordered beer and sake! two thumbs up already. but the main difference this time was that i noticed that they had a separate WHITE/RED FRESH FISH of the day menu. might i also add that they had fish from TSUKIJI FISH MARKET in japan. we discussed whether radiation might be a problem. but we unanimously concurred.. F it, we live once in our lives, and we are NOT saying no to sashimi!!! on this little menu, you can order it nigiri or sashimi style. my coworker knew b/c he had been to tokyo a lot and knew which ones tasted better alone or on rice. but i would suggest you ask the waiter as he knows which is best!!if you know you&#39;re coming here, its a good idea to make reservations b/c its a small restaurant and they&#39;re usually crowded.in case you still don&#39;t believe that this place is good, in addition to their japanese servers and their wonderful chefs, the table next to me sat a japanese business man conducting his business lunch with a guy from europe. if you don&#39;t believe a chinese customer, then believe a japanese man!

Dinner at Akiko&#39;s was the BEST MEAL I had in San Francisco!I loved everything about our dinner. We walked in and sat at the bar, the sushi chef/owner Joe-san had the biggest smile on his face the entire night! I loved his energy!! After chatting with him I found out that the place is run by himself as the sushi chef, his wife working the kitchen, and his boys as front staffs. So cute!As for the food.. we started with the 5 pcs chefs recommendation (Omakase). which is such a good deal!! it&#39;s $20!! hello?? Where can you find $20 omakase??Joe-san made us a yamaimo (Japanese mountain yam) appetizer dressed with yuzu vinegar on a bed of mixed greens. So very refreshing! Then our sushi was served.. With every sushi, he does something different to it. Some he adds some ponzu, some he&#39;d sear, he also has a sweet soy he puts on that is absolutely delicious! Of course, the ones whom should be left alone, he does not mess with!He&#39;s so careful and detailed with the sushi.. it&#39;s truly an art! Everything he did was to enhance the flavor of the fish, and to bring out the perfect balance. Every bite was a little piece of heaven in my mouth! (drools as i type away.. )We also tried to volcano roll that was highly recommended by fellow yelpers. It was indeed very delish! It reminds me of orange chicken in a good way. I love how they make unique rolls, but also make the perfect traditional nigiri sushi.Also, Joe-san was so generous and made us several special dishes to go with my sake! He made a special shrimp ceviche dish that was to die for!! It&#39;s mixed with avocado and dressed in sesame oil and some other Asian seasoning.. you eat it with some fried wonton chips.. OHHH my it&#39;s soo good! n he made us a grilled yellowtail belly that melts in your mouth..I made a promise to myself that from now on, every time I visit San Francisco I will dine at Akiko. They&#39;re my new found family in North Cal..OH! and gotta mention, price is VERY reasonable.. please go and let Joe-san take you on an exciting party in your tummy!!! :)

I think I&#39;m only giving them a 4 because there are NO decent sushi places in the Financial. =PCame here for lunch with a buddy of mine. Jeebus service is slow. It&#39;s raw fish, does it really take THAT long to cut it?!Chirashi ($16): A surprisingly decent selection and amount of fish. However, some were fresh while others mushy and obviously were not handled properly during the freezing/thawing process. The chirashi came with sake, wakame, tai, walu, tobiko, ebi, unagi and maguro. I think that&#39;s it. Maybe hamachi as well? Like I mentioned, some were fresh, some weren&#39;t. Overall this is a decent place for sushi in the FiDi.Side note: Service is slow, prices are a bit high for lunch but hey, you&#39;re kinda limited on choices around here.

Very fresh fish, creative rolls, friendly service.We came here on a double date with friends and were charmed by the interesting decor and impressed by the food.We ordered a spread of sushi to share, including the tasty firecracker roll, sake nigiri, and two types of hamachi nigiri. The sushi was extremely fresh, buttery and flavorful. For my entree, I ordered the chirashi sushi. The sashimi was really good but it was one of the more disappointing chirashis that I have had; only about 6 pieces of sashimi, a bit of wakame salad and a sprinking of tobiko over sushi rice.My dinner companions all ordered udon and were very satisifed with their dishes.This restaurant has daily sashimi and sushi specials, some flown in from the famed Tsukiji Fish Market in Japan. Not bad for a hole-in-the-wall restaurant near Union Square.

Stumbled upon this place for dinner with 2 girlfriends around 6pm on a Friday night. We were seated immediately at a table that&#39;s reserved for 7:30pm so the waiter straight up said we have to eat fast.Aside from the first waiter blatantly telling us to eat fast, the service was great. We got water immediately and after we got a pot of hot tea, waiters came and helped us refill our cups. We didn&#39;t order a lot of plates overall, only 3 rolls. We got the Spider, Rainbow and VV and they were all noms. Props to the sushi chef b/c he rolled them tight, none of the pieces fell apart for any of us. The fish on the rainbow was super fresh too. The plates were also presentable and the prices were not too bad considering the location and atmosphere. The sushi rolls averaged $10 per roll. I have to say I left hungry since the three of us shared three rolls. I think if you want to have a decent meal, expect to pay around $30 per person after tip and tax.Definitely make a reservation because it seems like everyone else had one. The restaurant isn&#39;t very big, a front section with tables for twos and fours, and a back section with more tables. I definitely want to come back here to try the sashimi. Also forgot to mention, the waiters here are pretty cute IMO. At least ours was when his eyes disappear whenever he smiles... yes, I want to go again to look at them eye candies. ;)

This is a gem of a restaurant tucked away near Union Square. Went there for dinner and set ourselves up by the sushi bar, giving us ample opportunity to watch the food being prepared. We ordered omakase, which pretty much give the sushi chef free reign to pick whatever he thinks will hit the spot (though you can give him tips on what kind of things you like/want to try).The food was great, all made with fresh ingredients and explained to us by the chef himself. Had a great meal with tasty food, good service and a nice ambiance - would definitely go back.

Tasked with finding a delectable sushi dinner in Union Square I was surprised to find that my options were somewhat limited. I was lucky to land a reservation for three at Akiko&#39;s the night before our dinner. I didn&#39;t quite know how lucky until I arrived to find a sign on the door signaling that if I didn&#39;t have a reservation I was out of luck because the restaurant was fully booked for the evening.The atmosphere is positively adorb, with stylized cherry blossoms on the wall. The fish was incredibly fresh, the selection lovely (escolar!). Don&#39;t miss the crab and cucumber salad - wowza that was yummy.The service was super accommodating, letting us check in late for the reservation (two of our party ended up at a different akikos) and then bringing us 3 pieces for the nigiri instead of two so everyone would have one to try. Sometimes we felt a smidge abandoned at the front of the restaurant, but nothing egregious (perhaps I felt moreso because I was incredibly dehydrated and needed my water glass refilled often).Finished off the meal with a dish of black sesame ice cream for me, green tea ice cream for MB and a Dynamite roll for MB&#39;s bro, PB.

I&#39;ve been to Akikos 3 times for weekday lunches. Be warned: You need to make a reservation, (which you can do same-day via yelp/open table) or there will be a very long wait.I&#39;ve had:Oshitashi - Perfectly tender spinach with nicely flavored sesame-ginger broth. I highly recommend this.Miso Soup - Excellent. Among the best I&#39;ve ever had.The nigiri that I&#39;ve had has included some of the freshest fish I&#39;ve ever eaten. The price reflects the quality. If you don&#39;t want wasabi dabbed between the rice and fish, be sure to order it with no wasabi. I can vouch for the deliciousness of the:SakeHirameUmimasuNegihama roll - delish, but nothing to write home about.Rainbow roll - Very fresh. Not a huge fan of crab salad, though. Next time I&#39;ll order this with shrimp tempura in the middle.Spicy tuna roll - I added avocado. It was very good.Service is prompt. Restaurant is pretty small and a little cramped. It&#39;s always been very busy when I&#39;ve been in, so lunch takes a little longer than other places.This is the best sushi restaurant I&#39;ve found in this part of the city and I&#39;ve been working in the Financial District area for 5 years.This place doesn&#39;t get 5 stars because it is pricey, crowded and a little bit of a hassle. But the food is top notch.

I already had a preconception that there weren&#39;t any good sushi restaurants around downtown San Francisco. I had came to this acceptance because I&#39;ve never given a recommendation to any, which prevented lazy me from trying out any myself.I was craving sushi, so I decided to rely on Yelp to steer me in the right direction. This was the winning pick, as it was close enough to me and had sufficient reviews.We did not have reservations, but when we arrived around 6:45pm it was pretty empty. The decor very modern and had a hint of fancy dancy-ness, but when I scanned the prices on the menu I thought it was reasonable. I would say it&#39;s a nice place for a date.My bf and I shared the Spider roll, Firecracker roll, and a Chicken Katsu Donburi. The Spider roll was good; I like the use of soy paper in lieu of nori and the softshell crab was crispy. The Firecracker was spicy! but additively so; It was flash fried so there was a thin crunchy crust and the flavors worked well. I can&#39;t handle spicy, but still managed to eat almost half of the order. The Chicken Katsu was on the pricier side, but the chicken was moist. It was good, but not worth $11 (unless they provided another piece of chicken, THEN it&#39;d be a good order).Overall this place gives me hope that there is indeed some good sushi restaurants around the city. And I am excited to finally make an effort to go try more out myself.

Thanks to Yelp for introducing me to this place. I took my parents and we all really enjoyed it. Pricey (but not crazy), with very nice service, and everything was very charmingly presented and very fresh. The fish was really good, and I got to try kinds I&#39;ve never seen before at the cheap-o strip mall sushi I usually go to (which has its time and place).We got the 12 piece sashimi, dynamite roll (very good, filling, fried spicy tuna roll), beef teriyaki (really lovely), and chocolate mochi.I think it&#39;s a great place to take dates, parents (if they&#39;re game) and best friends.The restaurant is both cozy and loud at the same time. Reservations are a must for dinnertime. A real treat.

This place is terrible!I would be willing to give the food a second chance, but you couldnt pay me to deal with that service!A friend and I went for lunch and I wanted something filling. We ordered some edamame from who we thought was our waiter, to snack on while we waited.15 minutes later, when it still didnt come, we flagged someone down to ask. Our waiter came out 5 minutes after that with edamame. 1 minute after that, my food came out. Nobody said anything about my buddy&#39;s food, they just dropped my plate off and left. 10 minutes after that, his food came out.My salmon was fishy, small and cooked unevenly. The pyramid of rice was about two tablespoons of rice. The tempura tasted like it was previously frozen and a couple of pieces were burned to a crisp on the end.My buddy got 5 piece nigiri and when it finally arrived, he said it was tasty. He also got chicken teriyaki and the chicken was weird dark meat nuggets. He said it was alright, but it tasted a little weird.So we are about 35-40 minutes in when we finish our meal. We sat there with empty plates in front of us for 10 minutes. I got up to ask someone for the check. He brought the check but left the dishes there. Eventually the dishes were cleared and all we needed was my buddy to get his card back. That took about another 10 minutes. We were there for almost an hour to be served mediocre food, ignored the entire time and still pay $50 for two people.I left no tip.

I have eaten sushi in Japan and Akiko&#39;s quality is pretty close. Our waiter was so friendly and helpful in making knowledgable suggestions to our liking. We prefer the buttery fattier nigiri and he made several awesome recommendations. Our favorite, gotta have another piece, was the walu seared escolar. This was probably one of the best pieces of fish i have ever eaten. The Australian ocean trout was also great and very fresh. We also tried the Monk liver fish, or as the called it the foie gras of the sea. It was ok to my taste. Great place with excellent offerings and very fresh fish. The place is smaller so make a reservation ahead of time. There is no sign out front so it&#39;s kind of hard to find right away.

The food was good. I don&#39;t eat sushi often. Service was fine. The only issue was with 1 of the guys that poured water. He leaned over me and pushed me 2-3 times to grab the water cups. I thought that was unusual.The place is a little small, but nice setting. It&#39;s not bad for a small size group. We had about 8-10 people fit comfortably

Despite what other reviewers say, the sashimi did not taste anything short of &#34;flopping on your plate.&#34; The rolls were much better than the sashimi and nigiri, only because all the dressing masked the actual taste of the fish. Our sashimi was unpleasantly veiny, but even worse, I got brain freeze chomping into the just-defrosted flesh. The combo &#34;duo&#34; was also quite a joke; it came in a huge platter but the food itself was a splatter: deflated and tiny. The nigiri that came with the entree was waxy and cheap-tasting, and definitely did not come from the same source as their sashimi.Not only was the food disappointing, service was irritating. They were friendly, but extremely spotty. Although several tables were empty, we had no idea who our server was since we got a rotation of randoms. Not to mention, it took about 10 minutes to flag anyone down at any time.

Akiko&#39;s eel sauce, which I had on their dragon roll, is hands-down the best I have ever had. And I&#39;m a slave to the eel sauce. This is the real deal -- sticky, rich, and sweet.My fiance and our friend also enjoyed the california roll and the veggie roll. We sat at the sushi bar and watched their process (including blow-torches!) which was fun.But I&#39;d return solely based on the eel sauce.p.s. You need to pull really hard on the door for it to open. Same with the door to the bathroom.

I came here for my birthday just last night with 8 other friends and I must say Akiko&#39;s is AMAZING. They provided such great service and they worked with me to create a custom birthday menu that included amazing sashimi, rolls, nigiri, and other delicious items. Halfway down the menu for the night my friends and I were STUFFED. But we kept eating because it was so good.Seriously, some of the best sushi I&#39;ve had in San Francisco and am so glad to have tried out this place! The fish was great quality. Fresh, buttery, and yummy. Normally I end up eating somewhere in the mission or I go to other sushi places that are really good, but I wanted to check this place out. So happy i did!The chef came out to greet us after the meal and they all sang happy birthday to me as well! What a great night. Am definitely coming back here as often as I can. Highly recommend this place to anyone. I&#39;m a big foodie and so are my friends. You won&#39;t be disappointed here!Thank you Tony and Ray for helping me create such a great menu and serving delicious food.

Do you like your sashimi to practically flap around on your plate? Akiko&#39;s must have some sort of fishing line out their back door and into the bay because I consistently get really fresh fish here.The place is super cute and super tiny. Then again I am not partial to huge dining rooms serving raw fish en masse. That makes me &#39;side-eye&#39; the kitchen.But the staff is always really sweet and sometimes I dump a huge to-go order on them for my office and they do their damn best to get my food out the door asap. I don&#39;t know what else I could ask for in a restaurant.I recommend the Volcano Roll everyday and twice on Sunday. The Rainbow and RocknRoll Rolls are solid choices too.

The food was good, after having to ask 5 times to receive it. It wasn&#39;t good enough to make me want to come back.Had a birthday party at Akiko&#39;s last night. There were 12 of us there. We all ordered at the same time &amp; the waiter put our orders into his handheld digital order taker. Not sure what went awry in the process, but we were incessantly re-ordering.&#34;We ordered miso soup. Hi yes, we ordered miso soup? About that miso soup....&#34; &#34;If you wouldn&#39;t mind, we ordered a hot sake. Hey, can we please have a hot sake? A hot sake would be great about now, please.&#34;The rolls were decent, but we all got our food at bizarrely strange intervals. Half of orders here, ages of time would pass and someone else would get another roll. Our entire dinner took forever &amp; it was a strange atmosphere all together. Shame too, the inside is amazing. Akiko has a great feel, but I would never give it another shot, even if the Volcano roll is super impressive.To boot, it took us ages to get the bill. Maybe they had an off night, but I wouldn&#39;t recommend Akiko. Try elsewhere.

I absolutely love Akikos! Joe makes the best sushi rolls. The fish always tastes so fresh and mmmm....so good!I was lucky enough to have my husband throw me a surprise 30th birthday party here. He asked me where I wanted to go for my birthday dinner and of course I said Akikos. (he must have banked on me saying that). So off we drove to the City. We walked into intimate setting of the restaurant and I thought we were in for a great meal and quiet dinner.As we walked to the back, the lights came on and 20 of my closest family/friends were waiting to surprise me. Maybe not so much a quiet dinner (which was fine with me) but definitely the a FANTASTIC meal. Platters of rolls and nigiris, bottles of wine and the best company I could ask for.The owners, Joe, Mary &amp; Ray are the sweetest. They stored my cake in the back (which a friend brought all the way from San Jose) and brought Joe brought it out right after dinner so that everyone could sing Happy Birthday.The backroom has a great ambiance &amp; is the perfect size for small group gathering, but I&#39;ve been here plenty of times for an intimate dinner with my husband....and have even come here for a wedding reception.Great food, great service!!!

The best sushi I&#39;ve had in SF. I&#39;ve never been a huge fan of the raw fish - I always go for the rolls and teriyaki. Going with two puristsintroduced me to some new dishes and they were ammaaazing.The restaurant is a bit snug - but well worth it!

My goodness. One of the best Japanese restaurants I&#39;ve been to. My friend was raving about this place, and I didn&#39;t believe it until I actually went and tried it for myself. It is THE bomb. Their fish is so fresh and tastes incredibly clean! And knowing that Akiko&#39;s big on sustainably caught fish - two thumbs up - tastes even better. We got standard rolls like the rainbow roll and rock n&#39; roll but those in itself tasted really good - fresh and the flavors were just right. We also got white tuna and wow, it melted in my mouth... so freaking good. Their restaurant-brewed soy sauce was perfect for dipping - the right amount of flavor and not too salty. I definitely recommend their special sashimi - we got 3 different types - not exactly sure of the names but they were all imported straight from Japan. Very unique and very fresh. We also got a hamachi head and the fish was cooked perfectly, and it was served with a light ponzu sauce for perfection. The service was also impeccable. Our server Alan knew exactly how to meet our needs and when the kitchen ran out of certain items (because we came late at night), he gave us similar suggestions right away. He was super friendly and definitely embodied the true spirit of service. Can&#39;t wait to come back Akiko&#39;s!

I think this place was overpriced for the amount of food. The portions are super tiny, so you&#39;d need to buy a lot to feel full. So don&#39;t come here if you&#39;re super hungry like my friend and I were. Quality of the fish is pretty good. Service was slow, the food took forever to arrive at our table.

Very friendly host and very friendly sushi chefs!! Although they only had one server so unless you sat at the counter, service will probably be a little slow.Thought I saw Chirashi on the menu online but turns out that&#39;s for lunch only. Had the 49-er and the spider. Spider was amazing! The softshell crab was so crispy but not oily either. 49-er was pretty interesting -- quite lemon-y. Worth a try if you are a citrus fanCan see this being low key date material. Nothing crazy, just nice host, pretty quiet spot and solid food that probably won&#39;t disappoint

My darling coworker again took me to another eatery that I quite enjoyed. Craving for some udon, she asked if I would like to go to Akiko&#39;s with her for a getaway from the office. Of course I was game.She made a reservation for 12:45pm, but when we walked in, we immediately took the table right in front of the door. The minus part was the long wait for the water, the food, and the check. Roughly, our hour lunch was 75% waiting and 25% eating.My coworker ordered their tempura udon, completely vegetarian. I ordered their tonkatsu donburi. This is where Akiko won my stomach and my smidgen of loyalty. Their tonkatsu was amazing. I love my katsu, brings me back to Hawaii, but this was definitely a Japanese comfort dish that brought me to heaven and definite satisfaction.The dish consist of: panko breaded chicken, egg, onion, napa cabbage, and carrots over rice. I wish I took a picture of it, but most people aren&#39;t used to me snapping photos of everything I eat. I tone it down for my coworkers. Now rice is always iffy for me because of how different restaurants prepare it. And katsu, for me, needs to be made in a way where it isn&#39;t too dry or too fried. Akiko&#39;s got it right. Everything was right. The whole dish was dee-licious. And all for $10!I would love to go back, but again this is one of those places were the money and timing has to be just right. Can&#39;t spend all my hard earned pennies on a bowl of deliciousness all the time, just once in awhile or a week.

I had my birthday dinner with a couple of friends over here last night. The 1st thing that stood out was the music they played at this restaurant. I have a keen ear for music and they were playing chillout-type of music here. The 1st track I recognize was a Bonobo track and the 2nd one was by Ulrich Schnauss. 2nd thing I noticed was the service. The waiter was friendly and kept our glasses full of water, but the service was very slow. A warning sign should&#39;ve been when the waiter asked if we were in a hurry to go anywhere afterwards. The positive to the slow service was that everything was at least freshly made and tasted good. I absolutely love Unagi so I got the Unagi Donburi along with the VV and Volcano roll. It was neat that the volcano roll looked like an actual volcano with the pieces of sushi in the middle.

Well, when we first got here, David reached for the door, pulled, and it didn&#39;t open. We assumed it was locked or something but not closed (since there were people inside), so we wandered around to try to find another door, asked a nearby pub bouncer who said it was the only door he knew of. We came back and I gave the door a go. A little tougher to open than most doors but by no means locked. Unbelievable; guess Panda hasn&#39;t been hitting the gym.Service was pretty good, ambience was typical for a pretty nice sushi place. Got a sashimi duo, which was a couple pieces of salmon, tuna, and if I recall some sort of white fish, along with chicken teriyaki, miso soup and rice. The chicken teriyaki was pretty bad; a few small pieces of overcooked white meat drizzled with some teriyaki sauce. Definitely two star chicken. My fish however was GREAT (which is what I was really here for, lucky for them and their rating): the tuna was flavorful and the salmon was like butter. I don&#39;t have plans to come here again, but if I were in the area and wanted some good fish I&#39;d swing by.

I loved this place for lunch. Yummy rolls and great atmosphere. The only thing that I wish that Akiko&#39;s would do is let you order for take out. Working in the Financial District makes it so sometimes all I have time for is to grab my lunch and go back to work. I would probably come here more than once in awhile if I could order take out. :)

This is my favorite sushi place. I don&#39;t know if I should tell people that I want to keep this gem to myself but that wouldn&#39;t be fair to the owners.Then why no 5 stars? I&#39;ve had a meal here once that was average, but the sushi is 5 star. I&#39;ve only had sushi better one other place and that was in Philadelphia.The last time I was here he had copper river salmon sushi, I&#39;ve never seen that on any other menu. Their special this time had little salmon. Only one in 10,000 is caught. Explaining the 20.00 a pc price.I always walk in and get a seat, but I do eat dinner early. Most people walk right on by on their way to the Irish Bank and miss this gem.The sushi is amazing! I just love the rock&amp;roll. The miso soup is real not from a packet.Try one of the cold sake drinks. Low in calories and they havevsuch a selection.it is small and if you get there by 6:30 without reservation your pressing your luck.On warm days they have the door open so you can enjoy the most beautiful weather in SF.The sushi chef is just so cool. Not sure how much English he knows but I know enough Japanese to great him and thank him. He seems to be appreciative.

Akiko&#39;s is one good sushi restaurant. Tasty food. Great look. Could be even better...Love the seaweed salad. Love the rolls, especially the Rock &amp; Roll.Wish the service was a bit more attentive, the bathroom needs a freakin mirror above the sink, and for Pete&#39;s sake, they should buy hand towels. (Drying your hands on a clean toilet seat cover is sanitary but completely ludicrous.)All in all, a lovely little place to go. Perhaps someone will read my review and make it perfect!

Whoever this Akiko dude is, he deserves a big pat on the back! A few coworkers and I were looking for some sushi sit-down, and when our first option turned out to be take-out only, we pulled out the handy Yelp iPhone app and found our way to Akiko&#39;s - conveniently located one block away.The Miso was delicious - the tofu was above par and I felt like I had just stumbled upon some magical Obaasan&#39;s kitchen. My party went family style on a few rolls, and while they did take more than a hot minute to arrive, when they did, they were phenomenal. The quality of the Sashimi was amazing! I&#39;ve never felt so many variety of fish melt away as I squished my fat, thirsty tongue upon the morsels of finely cut and presented meat.While we arrived to an empty restaurant, and were seated as far back in the weirdly shaped and uniquely decorated dining nook (it&#39;s a bit small), the place filled up within 30-minutes and I can&#39;t imagine how hectic this place is at night.Akiko&#39;s is a wonderful choice for FiDi sushi for a casual lunch or even a date!

Really, really good food. Nice, lightly salted edamame, and a terrific cucumber salad. The interior design is very cool, if slightly claustrophobic in the back.The sushi rolls were definitely the best I&#39;ve had anywhere near this part of town. The only downside was that the service was strangely slow given that we arrived well after the lunch rush and the place was mostly empty.

Man. I wanted this place to be so much better. The space is awesome. I love the look. Very trendy and exciting.The food....just ok. The best thing I had was the gyoza. Well steamed and crispy on the bottom....perfection. Sushi rolls and others, just below par.I could have forgiven the less than mediocre food, only if it didn&#39;t take 20+ minutes to come out. I get it. Small place, maybe they don&#39;t have the most chefs to be working on my meal. But on a lunch break, we&#39;re on the clock.If we can speed up the process, I&#39;ll be back.

My wife and son joined me for a birthday dinner. I selected Akiko based on other Yelp reviews. We had a reservation and set at a table in the large back room. Rather than order various fish, we elected to have the chef select the fish for us. Turned out to be a great decision. All the sushi was delicious. I admit I&#39;m not a sushi expert, but everything tasted fresh with excellent texture and delicate tastes. Some of the dishes were cured in house like the eel. The wait staff was very attentive as well. If I ever try sushi in Japan, perhaps I could compare to a 5 start Japanese sushi place.

Driving around the city are tummy&#39;s growling and hey let&#39;s check this place out!We ordered a bottle of their Sauvignon Blanc they have only three varietals and typically when the wine list is minimal I am a little hesitant. But whomever chose the Sauvignon Blanc chose correctly.Our waiter I believe his name was Greg was very helpful, efficient and eloquent.We started off the volcano roll which was very good reminded me of orange chicken but only the crispy part of the chicken because there was no chicken with some firer spice!Joe made us a special roll I wish I would have asked the name it was very good. It was fresh eel plated on a bed of seaweed the flavors combined where extraordinary.The lay out of Akiko&#39;s is relatively small I like how they have utilized the space. The background music is soft and inviting, the clear glass lit candles everywhere are beautiful. The color on the walls are light creamy warm colors.Interestingly enough I heard they conduct mass once a week not sure if that is open to the public but in my book this place holds tranquility and rolls of passion.

Picked this place for my birthday dinner with 6 friends based on the 4 star reviews. I had made a reservation a week prior and the lady on the phone was adamant on us being on time. She said &#34; If you are not here at 7:00 for your reservations, your table will be given to someone else.&#34; So we showed up right at 7:00PM and there was one other table there, it was NOT busy at all and the entire place was practically empty!!!!!!!!!!!!! Oh and it was still half empty when we left at 9:00.Btw, this place has no air conditioning and the back room felt like a sauna on a rare hot day in SF. They tried to stuff us at the very end table in the backroom but we requested to move by the door. The menu was meh, everything you expect to see at a average sushi restaurant. I tried the California, the forty niner, and some other spicy roll and everything was forgettable.ATTENTION: no sake bombing here. They won&#39;t let you drop the sake shot into the beer so if you wanna have a little fun, you would need to pour your sake into the beer which is fine. I understand that some places are for that and some arent but i think it&#39;s the the way they approached the situation that was a little rude. I actually overhead a guy, possbily the manager talking to our waiter about us. Pointing his fingers at us and told our waiter that &#34; THEY CAN&#34;T DO SAKE BOMBS&#34;. Treat me like an adult please. The price is average, a little on the pricey side but not completely unreasonable given it&#39;s location. Right between union square and financial district.I think this place would have been better for a quiet date night but definitely not meant for large groups. I felt like the whole night the waiters were keeping an eye on us to make sure we behaved. Not a very good birthday dinner experience.

Easily the best sushi in the Financial District. Although this place is categorized as being in Union Square, I still considered it residing in the Financial District.The staff was friendly, atmosphere was on point and the fish was tremendously fresh. I got the sashimi platter and everything was delicious. Especially the tuna. And I always appreciate a place that doesn&#39;t frown upon on Saki bombs.Akiko&#39;s did have a few draw backs though. Their sushi roll menu was lacking in variety and the prices seemed a little steep for how small the portions are.That being said, this is now my new go to spot for sushi in the area.

Slowest service ever. We waited 30 mins and only got 2 pieces of sushi and still had to wait longer for the rest of our order. And no acknowledgement of taking a long time. Bad way to run a restaurant. Won&#39;t be coming back ever.

Akiko&#39;s is my new favorite Financial District sushi place. I like fancy sushi with lots of ingredients (Japanese authenticity is not as important), and Akiko&#39;s didn&#39;t disappoint.On the recommendation of other Yelpers I ordered a volcano roll, which includes salmon, avocado, tempura &#34;lava,&#34; and tobiko. It was complicated, just the way I like it. The tempora was excessive, there was literally a pool of it encompassing the roll. But it was tasty.I also ordered an &#34;A.J.&#34; roll that was simpler; it included tuna, scallions, and tobiko. It was also very tasty.

It&#39;s been a long time since I&#39;ve had such high quality fish that I had at Akiko&#39;s today. I took a client out to lunch today. Although they generally do not take reservation for two, they did it for me. How nice.The client and I ordered Edamame and Soft shell crabs as appetizers. The client also got miso soup. We also got negihama roll, spider roll, kampachi, hirame, suzuki, and uni nigiri.I can probably write forever about the amazing quality of sushi I had today, but I won&#39;t. Instead, I urge all of you to give this place a try. You will not regret it.Minus 1 star for slow service. Note: The chef was not Japanese, but that&#39;s ok with me. Get there before noon for weekday lunch. It gets crowded very quickly.The client loved the food, so mission accomplisihed!

Wow...top notch sushi in a really nice atmosphere. Went for lunch today with four colleagues from work. Everything we ordered was great - flavorful and fresh. Based on the decor of the restaurant and its proximity to Union Square, I expected small rolls for a big price. Not so. The rolls were generous and fairly priced. I&#39;d definitely go again.

Amazing food, amazing service, and awesome ambience. By far the best dining experience I have had in SOMA, and perhaps anywhere in San Francisco. Not to mention the cost is a fraction of other options, most of which are not nearly as good.

I absolutely can&#39;t have enough of sushi! I always have to have my fish fix every now and then. Did Akiko&#39;s do it for me? Yes it did! The fish melted like butta! I came here with a friend of mines for dinner a couple of days ago after spending time with her in the city. The decor was nice and the service was great as well!We ordered a large bottle Kirin to share to drink with our food. I ordered the sushi and sashimi combo which came with nigiri, some rolls and sashimi. It had unagi, sake, maguro, shiro maguro, hamachi, shrimp nigiri. The sashimi featured maguro, sake and suzuki. There were four pieces of various rolls as well. She ordered the same except for her combo not having sashimi. Pretty much the same lineup as my combo.This place will be added to my &#34;Best Sushi&#34; list.

I went here with about 12 people for a friend&#39;s birthday. While the place is small and has a cozy feel, it was surprisingly comfortable. The decor is pretty cool with an underground feeling to it. There was some cool artwork hanging around the place as well.I had been munching on food all day so I decided to just get a rainbow roll. Half hour later, while everyone else had gotten their food, I was still waiting. &#34;Strange,&#34; I thought to myself. &#34;Other people ordered the same roll but why was I left out?&#34; I inquired with the waiter and he wasn&#39;t sure either but he apologized and went to get my order right away. Then, one of my friends realized he had eaten my roll. I felt bad for the waiter since it wasn&#39;t his fault my food had not arrived. I explained this to him but to my surprise, our server was extremely kind and offered me a complimentary drink. Huge plus in my book!Anyway, back to the food. The roll was very very tasty. Fresh fish and well balanced with the sauce. Quanity-wise and with a normal appetite, this would not be enough to sustain me. I wish there was more since it was $12.I am very impressed with the outstanding service here! Food is great though I wish there was more of it. I would definitely come back again when I have a bigger appetite.4 stars.

I&#39;ve eaten here 3 times now and enjoyed all 3 visits. The space is very cool, the bar and a few tables at the entry and more tables on the other side of the wall - funky brick walls, but clean and aesthetically pleasing.As usual, I let the sushi chef pick for me. He tends to come with the same fish on all my visits - his salmon is excellent, maguro and hamachi are standards. The last time I had a red snapper sashimi with ponzu that was marvelous. He also loves to serve albacore with smoked herring tucked underneath. It&#39;s quite good.On one visit I had a couple of cooked items, including ribs which were pedestrian.If you&#39;re in the Financial District and want sushi, don&#39;t pass up Akiko&#39;s - you&#39;ll enjoy it.

holy crap this is delicious!I came here with 6 people total at 7pm on a Tuesday no reservations and we were seated immediately. Score!We ordered basically family style - 6 people, 8 rolls, and plenty of drinks. I wasn&#39;t a fan of their cocktails, but I&#39;m not of fan of sake. All of our rolls were delicious. I used to be a CA roll only girl - not anymore! I&#39;m all about the Dynamite roll and spicy tuna!Be warned, the edamame they put on your table is not free. It&#39;s $3. We told them that we didn&#39;t know that it wasn&#39;t free and they took it off the bill no problem. They didn&#39;t even look at us funny or question it or ask if maybe someone else ordered it and didn&#39;t say anything. No hassles whatsoever.The server even broke out our receipts for us so that we could pay for what we ordered. On my bill: 2 rolls, 1 appetizer, 2 drinks - $51 including tip. I paid for myself and my sister so that came out to $25/person. Totally worth it in SF.

As a SoMa resident, I am often underwhelmed by the number of decent restaurants that are open in the evening. And, as you can tell by my nickname, I really enjoy sushi. So when I discovered Akiko&#39;s Restaurant, you can imagine that I was pleasantly surprised.My bf and I sat at the sushi bar so we could watch the chef. It was an older looking japanese man as the head chef with an older woman as his sous chef. (Perhaps a married couple business?) He was a bit gruff, but throughout our meal he slowly warmed up after we chatted him up a bit.The menu was simple. We ordered 3 rolls and some nigiri. The vivi was an unagi and white tuna salad with a garlic sauce. I&#39;m not a fan of saucy sushi, but this was not too over-powering and delicious.We also ordered the rainbow roll. I typically dislike crab salad, but he mixed it up fresh right when we ordered it with japanese mayonnaise, and boy did that make a difference! I was really yummy! The fish on top was very delicious too . One of the white fish was so good that I asked the chef what it was (Tai - red snapper) and ordered a Nigiri!We also ordered the spicy tuna roll, which was a bit too spicy for me. I don&#39;t mind spice, but when I eat sushi, I want to taste fish.The Hamachi Nigiri was like butter!It was maybe a teeny bit more expensive than Sushi Toni, but the quality of fish and ambiance was worth it.All in all, good food, good service, and good price.

I don&#39;t wanna offend anyone, but this place looks almost gross and shady from the outside. But don&#39;t let that bother you at all, because as soon as you walk in, you&#39;ll see that it&#39;s not only very clean, but well-decorated and classy.There is very few seating in the front room, which includes the bar. The back room has more seating, but it&#39;s a pretty small space, so be ready to be overheard by your neighbors (ie: don&#39;t come here to discuss very private matters).The food here is delicious! As many people have mentioned, you can&#39;t come here and not order the Volcano (I think it&#39;s $14). It is phenomenal. So much fried goodness that is poured on top of the rolls in the shape of a volcano. The salmon here is delicious too-- not fishy at all. Where do they get their fish? I wish every sushi restaurant got their fish (esp the salmon) from where they do.I almost want to say they&#39;re expensive... but I should hold my tongue because what sushi place won&#39;t have you spending a minimum of $15 on lunch? I guess what I wanna say is, they don&#39;t have any of those $9 lunch specials. But oh well, those lunch specials at other restaurants sometimes just give you crappy CA rolls to fill the space.A lot of the appetizers, like wakame salad and tempura, are ~$6.Rolls range from $6-14.The servers and chefs are friendly, and plus, I have a special place in my heart for this restaurant because Akiko is my sister&#39;s name! Thank you for repping, Akiko&#39;s Restaurant!

1st off, I&#39;m not a huge fan of sushi (please save your scoffs, eye rolls, and smirks for someone who gives a d@#$.) However if there is a place that might get me to change position, its Akiko&#39;s. And before you go ahead and discount my review, I have eaten here on multiple occasions with friends who ARE big sushi fans and they agree its possibly the best place in the FiDi.First off the restaurant is a bit tiny but the extra room in the back does open things up a bit. And the long red clay brick wall does warm up the room. The staff is exceedingly friendly and after a few visits they will definitely remember you and know what your favorite dishes are.The grilled eel appetizer is fantastic and the donburi and udon bowls are super filling and come steaming to your table. Contrary to what a few others have experienced, I have always found the fish to be fresh and the special rolls are huge! I tired most of the special rolls, a fair number of the maki rolls, and various items off the sushi menu and everything has been tasty. I think a place should be judge on consistency rather than a one-time random occurrence.A few draw backs are that the menu is not as extensive as some other places that I have been and the hours of operation are quite limited. But if you are in the FiDi around lunch time and have a hankering for sushi do yourself a favor and check this place out, it will not disappoint.

How many foods can you think of that you crave on a regular basis but are still pretty healthy? How many of those can be prepared and served quickly so that you can be back in the office in under an hour? There&#39;s a reason why sushi is the second* most awesome thing ever to come out of Japan.Akiko&#39;s serves fresh, properly cut sashimi and nigiri, all the rolls that we&#39;re used to here and some we&#39;re not (ever had pickled plum and mint in a roll? it may or may not be your favorite but it&#39;s worth trying.) The noodles are generously portioned and tasty as well.Akiko&#39;s only falls short on price (it&#39;s fair considering the quality but not a value or someplace I could afford to eat every day) and service (At least in my last couple experiences. YMMV) but is worth a look if you work nearby.*The &#39;70-&#39;80 Toyota Landcruiser Wagon (FJ55). Did you really have to ask?** I forgot about Godzilla. Sushi is third and the Landcruiser is second.*** MUJI and Beard Papa and Guitar Wolf are probably somewhere in the top ten but by no means above Godzilla or sushi or the any of the Landcruisers until &#39;88 or so when they became lame overweight luxury SUVs. They are beyond the scope of this review.

I came here with my wife on a lark since we were staying in the hotel next door... we couldn&#39;t have picked a better place for our last meal in San Fransisco.We were already pretty drunk by the time we got there, so after ordering our first round of nigiri, we just let the chef figure out what we should eat. We ended the meal with something he called &#34;special balls.&#34; I think he was fucking with us because we were getting him a little drunk too. Whatever they were, I would eat his special balls again.Price was pretty good, eventhough we went through three rounds of food and two bottles of sake.

Every time I go to a new sushi place, I get disappointed as it is never as good as Akiko&#39;s, so I decided to give it well-deserved 5 stars. The place is very fun and friendly. My advice: sit at the bar for omakase tasting menu and watch the virtuous chef cook the best sushi plates just for you. Can get pricey, but totally worth it! The rolls and sake are also fantastic!

Akiko&#39;s was like urban legend for a while. Raw fish in the FiDi? Impossible. I had it bookmarked for months, not truly believing that it really could exist. The possibility of eating healthy slabs of unfettered sashimi daily called to me though, and I went straight to the source with Tinna H and Keane L for lunch.We started the meal off right with a cold seaweed salad. It was an unbelievable color of green with just the right amount of crunch and a cold tangy sauce on top and little sesame seeds sprinkled around. A good sign of an amazing meal to come, right? My sashimi arrived, all colors of fleshy pink and layed out for my eyes to savor.$18 later though, I felt a little gouged. The fish just didn&#39;t sing in the way that I was craving. Luckily, Otoro Sushi has just opened right around the corner from my house. Fresh fishies, I will have you yet!

Definitely good. Made a reservation via Open Table a night before, glad I did. It was a tiny, charming place. The fish looked fresh and great. My grandfather ordered tempura with chicken, and it was great. We had also gotten the Rock and Roll and the 49ers roll, which was absolutely amazing. Although the wait for the food was long, I didn&#39;t mind because they seemed short on service and very helpful. They kept apologizing and refilling my water. The server checked on us several times, and he was very nice, as was the water refill guy. Someone next to me ordered the nigiri selection, and it looked wonderful. I would most definitely recommend the 49ers roll, it had shrimp tempura, avocado, salmon, and paper lemon. It was refreshing yet creamy, and a new favorite. Would not recommend for claustrophobic people. I would love to come back next time i&#39;m in Frisco.

The food is delicious, although I would say the volcano roll was a bit of an overkill. We went on a super busy Friday and the food took a bit longer to arrive than usual, but the waiter was apologetic and tried to prioritize us as much as possible (as I had to run). I would definitely come back here for dinner. Next time I hope to get more nigiri

Went for lunch while in the city for training - attracted by high marks in Yelp and proximity.Small place - pretty cramped and pretty loud as a result. The service today at lunch was really slow - the food was terrific, but served so late that I had a miserably short time to enjoy. Nobody should have to scarf down tomo...Food might be good, but experience is important. Just A-OK.I&#39;d go back to try again, but only if there is no hurry to get back. You&#39;d think an hour was sufficient time at a sushi joint.

Definitely one of the better sushi places with a solid selection of fresh fish.I&#39;m a big fan of nigiris so that&#39;s pretty much what I got: you can&#39;t go wrong with any of their fish :) Although the unit prices seem slightly pricey but once you taste your sushi, you will understand that it&#39;s an awesome deal for the quality of fish they serve you. At many sushi restaurants they try to stuff you with rice, the nigirs here are made the right way, a beautifully sliced piece of fresh fish tightly hugging a small portion of rice with fish overhanging on both ends.Awesomeness! Start with an appetizer, get as many nigiris as you can, and finish off with a miso soup :)

The food is great. Just hard to get. The last three times I tried to eat at Akiko&#39;s didn&#39;t go so well.1.) They were out of hamachi and the take-out order wasn&#39;t ready when they said it would be. We waited for another 30 minutes.2.) We were turned away by the hostess who told us the kitchen closes at 9:30. It was 9:32.3.) They didn&#39;t answer the phone. When we showed up they told us take-out would take over an hour.Again, the sushi is really good. Just not worth the trouble.

There were not even that many customers in the restaurant when we came. I don&#39;t think the dishes are actually worth the wait. I would give 4-star for the quality of the food. But...the experience just pissed me off.

Udon noodle soup was watery and the broth had no flavor. Volcano roll was just plain ridiculous. Barely any fish. Tons of strange sweet fried stuff sprinkled all over it. Service was very slow. I didn&#39;t enjoy anything about my visit and would not return.

I cannot comment on the food as we couldn&#39;t order any. Nor did we get a chance to order a drink. Came on time for our 7:15 Wednesday night reservation, waited a few minutes to be seated then spent the next 20 minutes being ignored. Being able to simply order a beer would have been nice but apparently that&#39;s not on offer. A quick look around the crowded dining room revealed that over half the tables had NO food on them and they all were seated before us. Not a good sign; at that rate we&#39;d be there until midnight just to see a hint of fatty tuna. Took the decision to abort and walked out... Got the &#34;stink eye&#34; from the host... yeh, my bad.....

I love the volcano rolls, awesome. The sashimi are fresh and the atmosphere is cool too. But the staffs are not so friendly though. Anyway as long as they are not rude, they are just very polite, I still love this place.

I tried this place before an event and was very pleased, as I&#39;m usually pretty picky about sushi places.The atmosphere was nice and typical of that of a sushi restaurant. Nice decor, attentive wait staff.They have a &#34;Market Fresh&#34; menu as well as their normal menu. I was more than pleased with every dish we got, and this place more than satisfied my penchant for spicy, crunchy sushi.Highlights:-Sake sashimi (literally melt in your mouth salmon)-Volcano roll (not just a roll, but a bowl!)-Firecracker roll

Went there on a Saturday. It was pretty crowded and you needed a reservation to get a table. Thank goodness I made a reservation. I recommend you make a reservation.The sushi was pretty good. The Gyoza was not that great but the sushi was fresh. The seating arrangements was kind of tight. You could hear the conversation at the next table.

Wow, as a local I was surprised how good the food was here. Service was good as well. The sashimi was so fresh and the variety was great. There were a few things they didn&#39;t have but all in all the fish was amazing. They were accomodating as well. I will be back for sure and I am picky when it comes to sashimi. If you are in this area, go here for sushi--no other options are worth it. Ask for what you want and you will get it like hot edaname etc :)

This place is great. All of the staff are very friendly. I recommend the Philly Roll although it&#39;s pretty generic, but really anything you get is very likely to be good.I would make reservations if you&#39;re going during lunch or dinner rush or if more than 4 people are eating.

I usually rate sushi places based on the traditional, fish/rice only without all the fusion sauces to taste the freshness. This place was NOT fresh at all. The nigiri sushi was stale and fishy. I was very disappointed with both the food and the service. The waiters were not very friendly and they forgot my miso soup. The only time one waiter smiled was when he gave me my check. I would have had more respect for him if he was stern all the way through instead of the last and only attempt to get a good tip (too late).The ambiance was nice. I didn&#39;t try their fusion rolls or cooked dishes, but it failed as a sushi joint. I would not come back as there are way better tasting Japanese restaurants with better service.

This is becoming a regular after work dinner destination on a Friday: it&#39;s close enough to walk to, but feels a little more like Chinatown than Financial District. Also good for lunches, I should point out. And 8-person groups. Is the versatility becoming clear? Good rolls, good sashimi, good prices. It&#39;s on my list of favorite sushi places in downtown SF!

The sushi here is solid, though not as good as I remember it being when I first came here two years ago. For rolls, we had the Rock n roll, Dragon Roll, Forty-niner, and Rainbow roll. All were fine but nothing too special.I really like the design of Akiko&#39;s. The back room area is like a wine cellar, cool temperature with exposed brick walls. It&#39;s a very comfortable place to have lunch and you can easily have a conversation with people across the table, unlike some places where the noise level is so high you have to strain to hear your lunch companions.All in all, a solid 3-star spot.

I was not impressed and I expected more from this restaurant because fellow yelpers gave it 4 stars!The yellowtail was tough and the rice in the sushi roll was stale. The only thing that redeemed this place was the 49er roll. The 49er roll had perfectly thinly sliced lemon with salmon and shrimp tempura.The prices here are expensive for the low quality that is served.

Absolutely believe all of the other 4 and 5 star reviews... this place has amazing sushi!!My wife and I went on a Thursday night and after setting up a reservation with Open Table a few hours ahead, we were seated within 10 mins of walking in the door. We ordered the gyoza for an appetizer (moist, chewy, delicious), ordered the &#34;Pick Three Sashimi&#34; (the cuts of salmon literally melted in our mouths), and then ordered the Spicy Tuna roll (enjoyably spicy with great fish) and a firecracker roll.After chowing down on all that wonderful, wonderful sushi... I just can&#39;t get back to San Francisco soon enough to get more! If you like sushi and you&#39;re in San Fran, make sure you got to this place.

Went to Akiko for business as usual. The women in my office love sushi! I on the other hand find sushi not to be one of my favs. I ordered the tempura chicken plate, which exceeded my expectations! The chicken was flavorful, soup was terrific, and the presentation was great! My Co-workers ordered an array of sushi for the table, and were all smiles. Overall a good spot in the FIDI to get some great sushi.

Really great dinner. My wife ordered miso soup, edamame, and chicken teriyaki. All were excellent, with the chicken being moist and flavorful. I went the roll route and ordered the Rainbow Roll and the 49er Roll (the Niners won the playoff game today) . I loved both, but a the 49er was one of my all time favorites. Razor thin lemon slices played off the salmon beautifully and three colors of uni roe pleased the eye. I also ordered their cucumber salad with crab. A very generous portion of crab topped the large mound of delicious cucumber slices. I would return just for this salad! Service was excellent and friendly. The owner visited and we will definitely be back.

This restaurant is fantastic. I&#39;ve eater there at least 6 times. The sashimi is extremely fresh.

His sons run the front, and his wife helps in the kitchen.

The sushi was incredibly fresh and it was decently priced. the atmosphere is nice despite the fact that it will most likely be crowded when you arrive. The chefs take great care to make sure their rolls are done right, and it shows in the quality of their work. In particular, the Volcano roll and the ever popular Rainbow roll stood out for me. The server was a tad pushy in attempting to get us to order the cold over the hot saki, but once my foot was planted down he didn&#39;t change the subject. If you go during the prime hours on a Friday or Saturday make sure to make reservations at least an hour before hand, or you will be waiting due to its small size. A fantastic sushi shop at a decent price, never a bad choice.

I&#39;ve said before that usually I enjoy a sushi restuarant based on the entire experience, so I&#39;m always worried about choosing a hole-in-the-wall place for sushi, when what I really want is a delightful cove of treasure tucked away from the busy streets. That treasure being raw fish, of course! Indeed, my fellow yelpers did not lead me to a disappointing hole, but rather I feel more like geocacher that&#39;s just made it to the indicated coordinates and removes a rock to discover the treasure hidden beneath.OK, so this sushi place isn&#39;t really hidden, but you could almost miss it walking by if you didn&#39;t know where you were going. In fact, my friend kept walking even after I stopped, not even realizing we were at a sushi restaurant. His attention was grabbed more by the Irish Bank Bar &amp; Restaurant tucked down the alley next to Akiko&#39;s. The outside of Akiko&#39;s even looks like it may have been an Irish Pub back in the day. The inside is decorated to look like a run down building, some walls half brick, half stucco, and with wooden posts running diagonally from wall to ceiling.Bleh, I must be bored at work or something, why am I talking about the building? The sushi itself really was good, but then, I&#39;m not high-maintenance when it comes to sushi. As long as there are enough pieces of raw dead fish on my plate, I&#39;m good to go. I&#39;m not really going to get all huffy about mixed up orders and slow service. Again, I&#39;m there to enjoy my dinner, not hurry through a meal. Many thumbs up, more thumbs than I currently have myself!

Went with three other friends at 9 on a Friday. The sushi, nagiri, and sashimi aren&#39;t definitely not your pedestrian quality - there&#39;s a distinct difference in taste... in the good way. Every tastes fresh and flavorful - you cannot be disappointed. We had a bottle of dry sake on top - great stuff.Ambiance is also really great, and there&#39;re plenty of attractive girls that hang out here.Not cheap. By not means of imagination is this a $$. It&#39;s definitely a $$$, closing in on $$$$.Price: $63/person after tax and tipFood: chef&#39;s nagiri, chef&#39;s sashimi, volcano roll, and 6 other rolls the waiter recommendedDrink: dry sake

This place was highly rated and I really wanted sushi in San Francisco, so we went here for dinner. Although I&#39;m from the Midwest, I&#39;ve had my fair share of sushi, good and bad, from small divey places to upscale trendy restaurants. The service was very good, our waiter was very knowledgeable and friendly. The place has a trendy feel, good for a date night. If you like maki rolls, they don&#39;t have a very wide selection, so I was a little disappointed with that. However, the rolls we did have were extremely fresh, and very good. My favorite was their spicy tuna, probably one of the best I&#39;ve had, seriously melt-in-your-mouth good. We also had an unagi roll, which again was very fresh, and tasty. And we shared two pieces of wild king salmon nigiri, which had that same melt-in-your-mouth effect. I would&#39;ve loved more specialty rolls to choose from, but I was very happy with the overall experience - the taste and quality of what we ordered, the ambiance, and the service. Definitely recommend!

I love fish, but one of the skepticism I have is on its cleanliness. This paranoia is deeply-embedded, but it&#39;s not so disabling that I won&#39;t eat out or anything. Usually, it&#39;s not a problem, but sometimes....At Akiko, I wasn&#39;t hungry, so I only ordered their rainbow roll. I bit into a piece and heard my back teeth make this sharp crunch as if I had bit into sand. I immediately spat my food out. It looked like most of it was roasted sesame. To this day, I haven&#39;t deciphered what it really was, but overall I felt it was a bad move to put anything that remotely resembles sand in a roll.

This is a bona-fide family run operation - for better or for worse. The &#39;worse&#39; is that the workers are all (or are mostly) family, so their attitude is more casual than other places. The &#39;better&#39; is that Joe, the chef, has been running it for years, and has a number of customers he knows by name. In fact I was introduced to Akiko&#39;s by one of these loyal customers whom Joe still corresponds with, even though she nor her parents have been to San Francisco for years.THE TEMAKE (hand rolls) ARE THE BEST AROUND! The best deal, the best prepared and the best value. Try the Asparagus Temaki for a suprisingly sinful sensation.Go Joe!

Seriously ordered 8 pieces of sushi and its been an hour now. I mention something to the hostess about it and her response: &#34;We are not THAT kind of restaurant...we&#39;re a &#34;slow&#34; restaurant.&#34; WTF? Ok fine I can appreciate a &#34;european&#34; mentality when it comes to eating but really? It takes an hour to make 8 pieces? Salmon tasted old and fishy. Amaebi was also a little fishy tasting. Not fresh at all. Overpriced also for what you get. Don&#39;t understand what the hype is all about.

Although they were booked full for the night I was able to snag a seat at the sushi bar. My server was very friendly and attentive. The sushi? Delicious!

I&#39;m staying at the Hotel Triton right around the corner and was craving sushi for dinner last night, so I stopped in to Akiko&#39;s. I had a California roll and a Philadelphia roll and they were SO incredible and affordable! The California roll was rolled in this amazing toasted sesame that I&#39;ve never had before. I couldn&#39;t stop thinking about my dinner so I went again today for lunch and had the same thing. The girl next to me was also raving about her volcano roll. I sat at the bar and chatted with the chef, who was so sweet. He&#39;s a sushi master!!!

Why aren&#39;t there 6 stars? I have just had an amazing sushi experience that deserves far more then 5 stars.A few disclaimers: I am a sushi purist, ie I hardly ever eat rolls or pre-selected sushi combos and I don&#39;t put soy sauce on pieces that don&#39;t deserve soy sauce. When my mother was pregnant with me, all she craved and all she ate breakfast, lunch and dinner was sushi (I&#39;m 30 so they didn&#39;t know any better back then). Finally, I am from NY and since moving here 2 years ago have been wholly disappointed in SF&#39;s sushi offerings ... until today.The sushi here is very fresh and delicious. The seaweed is very crisp - as it should be. The ika was sliced thin and scored a ton - as it should be. They were almost out of hirame and offered me an alternative that was truly comparable and outstanding (for the record I ordered 2 orders of hirame and got the last order available and one of the alternative). The ikura was sweet and not at all fishy tasting. The white tuna literally melted in my mouth...twice...I had to order another order it was so good.Finally, they had not one but two unfiltered sake options - my personal favorite - including one by the glass.I have found my favorite sushi place in SF. NY better watch out there is some actual competition out here.

I love the sushi here! I come here literally every week. With a friend or a few friends. Decent price and really great service and atmosphere. Kinda industrial setting with funky artwork. Totally reccommend it! You might walk past it so look for the hanging sign by the Irish Bank!

Amazing decor, ambiance. Service was ok - struggled a little when it got busy, but they DID make up for it with a comped roll. Sushi was very good.

Located right next to Irish Bank but still a wee bit too far for me to eat there during my lunch hour since I&#39;m in the Embarcadero and when I say hour, I mean 58 minutes. I&#39;ll come back when I&#39;m not so pressed for time and when I&#39;m having a calorie cheat day because I want that Volcano Roll! With it&#39;s crumbling, crunchy tempura friend pieces of batter, spicyness, and presentation. The only bummer was that it took forever for it to be done. I&#39;ll come back for the uni too. The menu is not that robust but the fish is pretty good, considering it&#39;s in the Financial District where good sushi places are sparse. The cucumber salad was also good.

So I read one of the below reviews, and made sure to make reservations here for a Wednesday night via Opentable. I can&#39;t be sure, but it seems that reservations are more a formality, as there seemed to be plenty of open seats. Perhaps it&#39;s to get a better handle on their anticipated demand\supply issues? Anyway, the reservation was not hard to get. My date and I showed up at the requisite time, and were promptly seated. As other reviews have noted, this restaurant is hard to find, in the sense that it does not have signage in the front or anything. On the one hand, it&#39;s kind of cool, on the other hand, I had to walk by a few times to make sure I wasn&#39;t busting into some other random restaurant.We ordered the gyoza, a spider roll, a volcano roll, and a rainbow roll. Normally, I am not a fan of heavily sauced or fried rolls, but I did enjoy the volcano roll, especially the nice fried salmon skin! I probably wouldn&#39;t order it again though, based on my taste preference. The gyoza was good too. The scallop flavor is delicate, but permeates throughout the entirety of the filling. The sauce that comes with it is a bit sweet, not too salty, and is a good companion for the delicate flavor of the gyoza. The spider roll was also good. No overpowering sweetness or fried stuff, like you see at other sushi restaurants. To me, however, the standout was the rainbow roll. I LOVE raw fish (my date does not), so I ate practically the entire thing. The fish is fresh, and you can really taste the flavors. I am by no means a connoisseur, but I thought the fish was great quality. Next time (there will be a next time), I will order sashimi, other raw fish, and maybe even get adventurous with some of the chef&#39;s recommendations.We spent about $40. Not bad for a two-person sushi dinner in the FiDi.

Once again, a very small restaurant, but it&#39;s very nice. The setting is very cozy and romantic. There&#39;s a candle on every table so it&#39;s like you&#39;re having a candle-light dinner :) There&#39;s only one sushi chef and one waiter. The waiter is very nice and friendly. Their sushi is pretty good and they not only serve sushi, but also udon. They couple who sat next to us were eating it, and my boyfriend told me to ask them if it was good.. but I was too shy, so I didn&#39;t ask. But it looked pretty good to me. Anyway, back to our food. I had these two rolls and they were so good. My boyfriend had this bowl of sashimi on rice and he said it was pretty good too.

I stopped in here with a friend after work and it was nice. I hadn&#39;t had sushi in a year and was dying to try some here in San Francisco - a city that&#39;s KNOWN for its sushi.I was pleasantly surprised. We shared a couple california-ish rolls and a larger shrimp role and were feeling pretty full after.The service was good and the atmosphere was nice for having dinner conversation.

Probably the best sushi in the Financial district. I got a sampler of six nigiri and the fish was very flavorful and fresh. The kitchen was closed that day, so there were no hot items on a cold, rainy day when I really needed some hot miso. I was on my own but I saw many couples and friends and quite a few regulars enjoying the cozy, stylish ambience, great music, and congenial hospitality of the owner and staff. The menu featured fresh Spanish albacore, exotic uni, and scallops flown in overnight from Japan. I would definitely go back, but be sure to get a reservation.

Easily the best sushi I&#39;ve had in the financial district. The service is fast, even during the lunch rush and while a little more than places like the &#34;Sushi Boat&#34;, you&#39;re paying for the quality of the ingredients which is excellent. I&#39;ve stuck to things like sashimi and nigiri and have not been disappointed.

High-quality fish, cozy feel, and cordial service. I&#39;m a big fan. Intimate ambience and decor, unassuming and attentive service, and deliciously buttery-tender nigiri. Have never sat at the bar, but the chef is always very friendly and greets us when we arrive. I love, love, love the a.j. roll... the spiciness is -- unlike cheap spices or hot sauces -- perfectly overwhelming without being nauseating or disruptive to the flavor of the tuna.Dress code is business casual. Very reasonably priced -- a huge plus and pleasantly surprising for this part of town. Reservations are recommendable for groups but not necessary. (Also, check out the lovely restroom while you&#39;re there: despite being even more dimly lit than the restaurant itself, it&#39;s a world of its own... tiny, relaxing lounge-y feel, no mirror, hip and modern look, great hand lotion.)Best sushi in the Financial District, by far!

This is one of my favorite sushi places! It&#39;s classy, but not expensive, what could be better? I always get a rock and roll, or something else with unagi the first time I go to a new sushi place since it&#39;s my favorite and then I have a good basis to compare to other places. I have to say, this is one of the best in the city. Highly recommend this if you&#39;re in the area!

My wife &amp; I went to Akiko&#39;s while on our honeymoon in San Francisco after reading the good reviews of the place. We enjoyed it. The place is quaint &amp; feels trendy, but in a warm and pleasant way. The food was delicious. The only negative part of our experience was that the service was lacking in attention and friendliness to us. I had to wait forever for a spoon for my miso soup and they didn&#39;t really seem to care about the customer&#39;s overall dining experience. I&#39;d still recommend going, if only for the great food.

We made a reservation for 2 tonight and came here hoping for delicious, fresh sushi. We sat at the sushi bar. The waiter greeted us, was friendly and helpful. However, the sushi bar experience was lame and indifferent. This usually is the best seat in the house...not here! The Asian chef with the mustache, the sous chef, and the owner were behind the sushi bar and did not once greet us, smile, or ask us what we were interested in. They did not even take our order. We flagged down the waiter and ordered the 6 piece sashimi, volcano roll, rock n&#39;roll, and salmon/avocado roll. The fish was very fresh and flavorful. While the food was very good, the indifferent and disengaged sushi chef (younger guy with mustache) and staff behind the sushi bar, slow pace of food coming out, and expensive, small portions just ruined the experience. We paid our bill with no follow-up on how the food was, if we wanted dessert or tea, or thank you from the anti-social sushi chef (specifically the Asian one with mustache in his early 30&#39;s, no hat on his head, and constantly wiping his sweaty forehead with his sleeve). He did not thank us but the waiter and busboy were polite enough to do so. Food good...service, portions, and prices fall very short! Won&#39;t be back or recommending this place to friends.

This place is right around the corner from my work and I love it. The sushi is always fresh and delicious. I love to sit by the windows and watch the people walk by, but if you go to the back they have this beautiful exposed brick wall with great artwork displayed. I am a fan of art, so love it back there too. One time it was a bit loud since there was a huge party next to us, but with the food being good, I didn&#39;t mind. If you are in the financial district, stop by for some delicious fish.

12/4/07: Updated to 5 stars after many great visits, including parties of 10-15 people.My husband and I have officially made this our new sushi joint after trying many places since our favorite spot Ginza closed and we are picky when it comes to our sushi! We want traditional sushi without the haughty attitude.Akiko&#39;s is bigger than it looks from the outside but is easy to miss. It has an unpretentious but still nice atmosphere, fresh and delicious fish, and no sushi-etiquette nazis! It&#39;s affordable for sushi - not cheap, but I wouldn&#39;t want to eat cheap sushi anyway.Joe the sushi chef is friendly and funny. Ray, one of the waiters, is cute and friendly, going so far as to remember our names after only 3 visits.I hear it&#39;s mobbed at lunch but I haven&#39;t been. It&#39;s nearly empty on weeknights and busier but not mobbed on weekends, which is great because the sushi bar is always open.Light and delicious tempura! The potstickers are made with fish, which I didn&#39;t like that well. The seaweed salad is great. Ask for the day&#39;s fish that might not be on the menu (always a good idea at sushi joints) or do omakase (chef&#39;s choice). Joe has some very light-handed and unusual preparations of his sushi that enhance without overwhelming.

I came here Saturday night with a group of 20 for my birthday dinner. We arrived a couple of minute before our reservation time, but we waited 15 minutes in order to be seated because of a previous group that was still in our designated area. We were seated in the back part of the restaurant, which I guess is usually for larger groups. I really liked the ambiance of Akiko&#39;s; really trendy &amp; intimate. Our servers were attentive at the beginning, but we kindof had to track them down throughout the night since there were other patrons that they had to tend to. Our food all came at random times, but came in a timely manner, which was understandable. Their hot sake was pretty good &amp; really warm. Sashimi was pretty good too; pretty fresh but I felt that it wasn&#39;t as fresh as Sushi Bistro. The volcano roll was probably the best dish I had. I&#39;ve had volcano rolls at other sushi restaurants, but Akiko&#39;s was one of the best. Oh yeah, no sake bombs? What kind of Japanese restaurant does not do that? Apparently Akiko&#39;s. We improvised &amp; just chased our sake with beer. Everyone in my party had a great time, besides the unordered items that were on our bill. I know that we were loud &amp; all, but still .. wth. I might come here again; maybe not with a large group, but with a smaller group or a date. Thanks Akiko&#39;s for accommodating 20 talkative 20-somethings!

We were very disappointed by Akiko. We had to fight for service and mediocre sushi.After reading the Yelp review, we expected good sushi with reasonable service. We got poor service with mediocre sushi. The restaurant was too full and too many takeout orders had been accepted. The service was terrible--the waiter said we couldn&#39;t get handrolls because the kitchen was too busy, didn&#39;t greet us, never checked to see how we were doing, etc. The saki was off, the sushi rolls weren&#39;t great and the fried food we ordered (tofu and tempura) tasted like the oil had been reused. Overall, we were very disappointed with the restaurant and did not enjoy it at all.

Came here based on yelp reviews and had high expectations. I&#39;ve heard the sushi in San Francisco is exceptionally fresh. That might be the only thing this place has going on. Both the salmon and tuna sushi were fresh and tasty (I gave one star for each). I also had a salmon avocado roll, but it was just bland. But the problems started as soon as we walked into the restaurant. We had a reservation and got there a little late (walked from our hotel and not familiar with the area). The owner/manager/waiter had attitude with us right away and we considered leaving, but didn&#39;t. We got seated a few minutes later and then waited probably a good 20 min with the menus before someone attending to us. Finally we ordered wine along with appetizers and entrees. The wine took another 15 minutes and only came to us after I motioned to the &#34;man&#34; that we we were waiting- still. When food actually arrived at our table, we weren&#39;t impressed, except for the freshness of the sushi, as I said before. Overall too much waiting, the restaurant was sweltering hot, and the &#34;man&#34; was rude. Don&#39;t eat here, I&#39;m sure other sushi places in the area are better.

3 people bill came to $100 for lunch....wait what? yea thats right $100.We had 12 piece sashimiZeeky had the Chicken Teriyaki/Tempura ComboJean had the Beef Teriyaki/Tempura ComboI had the Saba shio-yaki/Tempura Comboand there was a dinky bottle of sake.service was good, the guy was nice and mainly the stars are for that guy. I know Jean would of gave them 0 stars. The food was alright. It just wasnt worth the money. The sashimi was not extraordinary and it seemed really skimpy..and furthemore the only thing that tasted good on that plate was probably the red snapper. Even the salmon just didnt cut it. The tempura was not really different from any other place and my saba was a lil over salty, it was not bad but a lil too salty. And it might be a bit smarter to add a bit more rice to the dish. Rice is not expensive, dont be stingy with it.Now, Jean is our supervisor and she treated us to lunch, yea Zeeky n I didnt have to pay but I could tell Jean was like &#34;huh?&#34; Well you see, her husband owns a japanese restaurant and she was pretty suprised..and not in a good way. I can say that when it comes to food, money isnt really an issue..well as long as its good. The food here just wasnt worth the money and if i had a choice I wouldnt have paid that amount of money for this quality of foodI see all these wonderful 4 star reviews for this place and I&#39;m confused at why. People are saying this roll and that roll is delicious, so maybe I should of ordered a roll. The way I see it is that if they cant do a tempura combination right I wouldnt bother with the rolls.So two stars for the service~

Coming here for the first time for a dinner on Wednesday night. First impression was how nice and classy the decor looked. The wait staff seemed quite attentive and seated us at the table next to the window the moment we walked in. We ordered the volcano roll, chicken donburi and the 10 piece nigiri and sashimi. One word I must say is - expensive. This place has very fresh and good sushi but for the amount of food we received it was quite expensive - the two $$ don&#39;t justify the prices at the restaurant. However, when the food did arrive everything was quite delicious - the sashimi melts in your mouth and the chicken katsu was nice and crispy. The volcano roll was definitely something special with loads of tempura bits on top of the roll which were delicious enough to eat as is. Great sushi and very nice decor but the prices were quite high for the amount of food that was offered and I guess this would be a 3 1/2 stars but I guess the waiting staff wasn&#39;t as friendly or as attentive as they should be. Will come back to try it again but the sushi is quite expensive for the quantity given.

So this is my first ever review and this place is definitely worthy of it!I went here on a Friday night a couple of weeks ago with a few girlfriends. Being skeptical of sushi in general, I looked up the reviews and felt it would be a good place to check out. And I was right!Not only was this the best sushi I&#39;ve ever had, but the service is amazing. Our servers Ray and Alan R Lee (here&#39;s your shout out!!!) were awesome. We received a free sake and and ice cream on the house.We ordered the dragon roll, volcano roll, and shrimp tempura roll, along with a plate of chicken teriyaki. Everything was great! We didn&#39;t need the complimentary items but it just went to show how appreciative this place is towards customers. I definitely plan on going back soon!

Loved it. Great great sushi, especially so close to the financial district, and very reasonable prices. Not much more I could ask for. The cucumber salad was a great start to to the meal. The atmosphere was very cozy and intimate.

Great Sushi in the Financial District without overpaying as you do with many of the other nicer sushi restaurants in the area. The Volcano Roll and Fire-Cracker Roll are musts when sharing with a large group.

I agree that this is probably some of the better sushi the FiDi has to offer. The fish is always fresh and comes out pretty quick. The teriyaki (sue me, I wasn&#39;t in a raw fish mood that day) wasn&#39;t really that good, especially for the price. (This place isn&#39;t cheap by any means: definitely a good idea to take the out-of-town boss there for a company-funded meal.)The place offers a nice setting. The back room almost (un?)intentionally offers an homage to the spirit of the Kearny Street corridor. At any rate, it&#39;s comfy and quiet.Service is a little slow, but by no means glacial. Oh, and one of the servers is freakishly hot. I probably shouldn&#39;t say so but he&#39;s seen me and my dining companions drooling into our miso so many times I doubt it&#39;s much of a surprise. Bonus!

Excellent sushi! Anu V. introduced me to the wonders of the firecracker roll... or was it the torpedo roll? Or the bombshell roll? Firework roll? Shoot, I can&#39;t remember what it was called, but it was really good.Hot tea upon arrival on a cold night and tasty miso soup to follow. Not at all crowded in the evening, though I imagine it is packed during the day with all the FiDi people on lunch break. Yum.

Happened to be in the area and found this place on yelp. Delicious sushi and chef joe was very friendly and really knows his stuff. There was a little confusion with the order which is the only thing that kept it from being 5 stars but overall really great. I will say, not as good as kiss seafood but I consider that place in a league of its own.

I have been to many Sushi places, some bad, some good, some great. Akikos lands solidly into my great category. My beautiful girl and I are staying at the Hotel Triton for the weekend and decided to give this place a go because it was right around the corner from the Hotel. We arrived right when they opened for dinner. We spent almost an hour sitting at the sushi bar talking with the Chef / Owner Joe and eating. The sushi was absolutely amazing!! Fresh fish, creative rolls, and just good fun. Joe made us a couple of off the menu items and really showcased his expertise in the art of Sushi!! Thanks Joe, your establishment is now going to be a must go every time we are in the city.

I work in the financial district and being relatively new to the area, I&#39;ve been scouting for a good sushi place. I was on my way to Miyabi sushi express, based on them having decent ratings on here, but they had a temporary water problem... so I roamed the streets randomly, which can be very dangerous.Akiko&#39;s restaurant looked dark but coming closer, the bar looked inviting so I entered. Huge smile from the chef - a good start! The service was prompt and polite, and the sushi was amazing - fresh, beautifully prepared, and not that expensive considering we&#39;re talking fresh raw fish! I only ordered sushi, but their hamachi, ebi and sake were very good as well as a standard fare of californian rolls - which the chef managed to make interesting and different somehow!I stayed at the bar but there is more space towards the back and the decor looked amazing - a place to keep in mind for the evenings too.I&#39;ve now found my favourite sushi place for lunch : )

This is a great sushi restaurant!! We had some time to kill and really wanted to enjoy sushi. The food was so incredibly fresh and the variety was just perfect for what we were looking for. We got a perfect seat by the window and the establishment was comfortable. The staff was friendly and receptive ... we didn&#39;t have to ask for anything. Definitley worth trying the 49er roll!!

On a chilly afternoon, nothing beats a bowl of udon noodle soup at this restaurant! The broth is sooo delicious and the vegetables are all very fresh. They have a good assortment of small plates that really get your appetite going! Don&#39;t miss the sesame spinach! WOW! Service is quick and efficient. And there are a good amount of vegetarian items to choose from.

The only problem I have with this place is that the quality doesn&#39;t seem to be consistent. The food is a bit over priced, but it&#39;s OK because I shouldn&#39;t eat too much anyways. The sushi pieces are small, and some fish are fresh, and others are not. I guess I would go back if I can&#39;t think of any where else.

This place really hit the spot yesterday. Their rolls are perfect - not too much rice, fresh ingredients and decent portions. Each of us required 2 rolls each to satisfy. Sad to say that this is one of the only sushi places near Fin District that is not sheeshee (Ozumo) and not a chain sushi factory. It&#39;s slightly pricey, hence the 4 stars - plan to spend around $20 for a nice sized sushi meal. They also have a great cucumber salad, Chef salad and Volcano Roll if you like spicy! They can use some new menus - those things are falling apart!

I used to frequent this place a lot with my colleagues, however, we felt the need to venture outside our foodie comfort zones. So, by chance, we ended up at our default spot for Japanese food.The service is on par with the fanciest restaurants in the City but the food was not quite what we remembered it to be. The quality of their sushi remains but their cooked foods left a little something to be desired. They tend to skimp on the add-ons like the veggies. I&#39;m a carnivore at heart but getting a little more veggie wouldn&#39;t hurt.

Talk about serendipity - I was staying at the Galleria Park hotel and had a hankering for sushi so searched on Yelp for the nearest sushi bar. I was on my way to Sushi Toni when I walked right past this place and decided, since it was closer, to pop in. The ambiance looked inviting and they had a sushi bar, so I sat down at the bar by myself. I ordered a nigori sake and small Sapporo. I had no idea where I was and what I was in store for, I just figured I would get some standard sushi at a quiet, quaint place near my hotel.I thought about doing omakase, but wasn&#39;t really that hungry and had my heart set on some standard nigiri - salmon, spanish makeral, tuna, etc... The waiter came over and made some recommendations and I ordered three nigiri sushi&#39;s. They were fantastic. It was then that the sushi chef asked me how I liked it. Turns out, the sushi chef is &#34;Joe&#34; the owner of the restaurant. I didn&#39;t even know the name of the place I was eating. I actually asked the sushi chef what the name of the place was and he handed me a card. At that point, I asked Joe to recommend stuff for me. I was not disappointed. In fact, nigiri after nigiri and handroll after handroll, I sat there and really thought hard about what I was about to tell Joe. I wanted to make sure I was being truly honest. He made me a handroll that was the best handroll I&#39;ve ever had. I&#39;ve had sushi at some of the best sushi places in Los Angeles, New York and San Francisco and I&#39;d never had a handroll like Joe made me.I&#39;m so glad I happened upon this place and the next time I come back to San Francisco, this is where I&#39;m going for sushi. Joe is a delight and provided me with some of the best sushi I&#39;ve ever had. We toasted (kampai!) and had a great time. This place is truly legit and I really, really look forward to coming back.

Shopping definitely makes for hungry girls. We happened to &#34;run into&#34; this joint as our real intent was to go to E&amp;O, alas, it was closed for remodeling. We then decided to check out the restaurant in the alley, and &#34;ka-pow&#34;... Akiko. We both haven&#39;t been here before, so we decided to give it a try. We started with agadashi tofu and miso soup, followed with the spicy tuna roll, sashimi combination, and katsu don.The agadashi was not the most flavorful I&#39;ve had, the broth lacked the sweetness that I prefer. The miso soup was actually pretty decent because it was not salty like other places. That rates in my book. The spicy tuna rolls and sashimi combo (salmon, tuna and yellowtail) were fresh and palatable. The katsu-don, I can&#39;t comment on as I did not have a taste of it. But, if I were to rate it based on appearance, it looked it appetizing. My friend said it was tasty.My only complaint is the snail&#39;s pace of the wait staff. The person setting up and cleaning was quick - it was the person that took the orders that was slow. It took a while, a long, while before he got to our table. To be fair, it was getting packed soon after we got there and he was the only wait person in the restaurant, and on top, we were extremely ravenous. Almost towards the end of our meal, he seemed more attentive and came back to our table to refill our teacups.Overall, it would be a place I hit up again if I were in the FiDi and wanted Japanese food. But, I can&#39;t really give it a 4 star as I need to try it out once more for consistency...

I am staying in the city a couple nights and found this place on Yelp when I landed. It&#39;s close to the Hilton - Financial District so it was an easy decision to drop in for lunch. I was dining alone and asked for the sushi bar which was pretty wide open. They stuck me at the worst seat by the register and service station. It makes sense so small groups can sit next to each other but I expected better service since I was in the middle of everything happening. Not the case. I had to ask for several things and ended up stealing a napkin from the spot next to me. Seriously, if you&#39;re going to put someone in the worst spot in your establishment, at least have the courtesy to treat them right. Why 4 stars? I had an excellent chirashi bowl. The fish was very fresh and the sushi rice was easily the best I&#39;ve ever had. The sushi chef was rushed but managed to produce a perfect bowl of the freshest offerings. I did not punish the chefs on the tip as they excelled but someone needs to step up and figure out how to manage the restaurant.

First time I went to Akiko was almost two years ago. Nothing really stayed with me. I went there again today since many people here are talking about the restaurant. I ordered Chirashi, which had 5 pieces of sashimi, shrimp, and eggs over sushi rice. The service was quick. My order came within five minutes. But I have to say that their sashimi is not the best. It is too dry, and it&#39;s very thin. I am a little disappointed. But overall it&#39;s a good dining.

The rolls were mediocre-don&#39;t try the firecracker roll &#39;cause it tastes like an old tempura roll that&#39;s been sitting out for a few hours. The service is okay-I think there was only 2 servers and because most of the customers were in the main dining room in the back, we got bupkiss basically. Spider roll was a little on the sweeter than normal side and basically all the sashimi were standard. What threw me off just a little bit was the fact that I never half of what I ordered. I got charged sure, but I never got it. And when we left and I had to come back for my cell phone, there it was sitting on the glass. Of course I&#39;m going to inquire if that was suppose to be for me. It wasn&#39;t busy or anything so I don&#39;t understand where the confusion is. My friend said &#34;just let it go-not a big deal.&#34; But from pen to paper to register, how do you forget to drop off food that&#39;s just sitting there? Maybe they were having an off day-I&#39;d rather go to Masu anyhow.

I&#39;ve been living downtown for over 2 years now, and had never gone to Akiko&#39;s before, despite its location (about 2 blocks from my front door). I don&#39;t know why I never stepped inside before now, but I do know that I&#39;m glad I finally did! The decor was a bit puzzling (partial exposed brick with some exposed piping and cement, with interesting, if confusingly religious? art on the walls), but welcoming and pleasant.The atmosphere around 8pm is extremely quiet, unpretentious, and laid-back. The sushi is no-frills on the menu, but comes to the table with lovely presentation and great flavor! I personally recommend the Rainbow Roll.The pricing is not unreasonable, especially for good sushi, but is still just a smidge higher than I generally enjoy paying. Certainly it was not unexpected for the financial district. After all, if you want cheap sushi in San Francisco, it&#39;s hard to find outside of the Richmond!The service was not particularly attentive, but not by any means bad. I suspect that if we had sat closer to the front of the restaurant, we would have received more attention. As it was, we were in the furthest-back corner of the place, which proved to be cosy and private, and made up for the lack of attention.

In case you thought I give every place 5 stars, here&#39;s a precisely 3-star review. The value is decent -- not cheap, but good-sized portions. The quality is passable -- obviously fresh, but poor cuts and poor texture. It&#39;s clean, so it won&#39;t kill you. But the amaebi was heart-breakingly rubbery. boo hoo! The service was terrible-- only 1 cup of tea for 1.5 hours of dinner. Hmm, maybe this should be downgraded to 2 stars...

Akiko&#39;s charming space filled up by noon with all kinds of downtowners. The food was a step above similarly priced Japanese restaurants I&#39;ve been to. My friend got a huge portion of vegetable tempura, and I enjoyed a few pieces of vegetable sushi. If I knew the scallop nigiri was chopped, sauced and roe&#39;d I&#39;d have ordered something else. Never had it served with so much stuff before. Like most sushi, not a good place if you&#39;re in a hurry.

After giving a friendly nod acknowledging our presence it took 10 min for the waiter to finally stop by. At that point we were hungry and angry .

I&#39;ve been getting my hair cut around the block from this place for a while and this was my guy&#39;s suggestion when I needed to pick up some soup to bring a sick friend. I accidentally went to a similarly named place near by though! But last week I finally made it here for dinner. Their miso soup totally hit the spot on a cold night and their seaweed salad was delicious as well. The sushi was good, not great. Their deep fried spicy rolls were really interesting, we tried the Firecracker. It was good but I thought the batter should be a little thinner, it weighed down the taste a bit too much. The restaurant is very cute. The only other people eating there on a Thursday evening though was a crowded of loud and rather obnoxious business men. Otherwise is would have been quiet and empty, but instead it was hard to hear the hubs speaking to me from across the table at times.

This is the best Japanese food I have ever had. I used to eat here five times a week when I worked a block away from this place. The sushi is fresh-picked every morning by the chefs at local fish markets and the food is prepared with incredible expertise. My favorites are the miso soup, chicken udon, dragon roll, caterpiller roll, FIRECRACKER ROLL, and the collarbone-looking piece of fish.

I often come here for my lunchtime sushi fix. The sushi is fresh and good. If you order the mixed sushi plate beware the pickled sock sushi, it&#39;s got yellow pickled something, tastes like gym socks, I asked what it was once, and I forget what it&#39;s called but she followed it with &#34;its really good huh? very tasty!&#34; sadly I really don&#39;t agree. Other than that though I really like everything there. Good miso, salmon teriyaki is tender and good, sushi is fresh and good. And they got a 100 on their health inspection, which is always good to see at a place that sells raw meat. Usuallly pretty fast for lunch if you don&#39;t go right at noon.

The greens dishes, especially the spinach, were beautifully presented and intensely flavorful. The sashimi was fresh and delicious, particularly the hamachi (I&#39;ve never had hamachi that shade of pink before!.) Service was unobtrusive and the decor was elegant and comforting. This isn&#39;t the sort of place that has cutesy names for its rolls or paper lanterns all over the place... It was sushi for adults, but reasonably priced.

Feeling in the mood for Japanese food, but not wanting to stray far away from home, I decided it was time to pay a visit to Akiko, a small restaurant on Bush Street between Kearny and Grant. On a Monday night, we find this quiet enclave practically empty. Our waiter seated us immediately, at a table near the sushi bar. We barely had a chance to look at the menu before he was back to take our order (talk about quick service!) The menu is not extensive- although there are a variety of sushi choices, when it comes to regular food, the options are limited- a few udon choices, but no ramen or sukiyaki. We decided to start with edamame and a salad followed by various sushi rolls- egg and vegetables as well as the California roll among others. The edamame arrived first, steaming hot, in a cute dish along with a separate bowl for the pods. We enjoyed a bottle of hot filtered sake while waiting for the rest of the dishes to arrive- unfortunately I cannot remember the brand, it was very mild and slightly sweet. Next to arrive was the salad- greens with cucumbers, pickles and a ginger miso dressing presented artistically on a plate decorated with a sesame seed containing sauce as a garnish. I am usually a fan of Japanese salads due to the miso dressing, and this salad was no exception. Our rolls followed- pretty standard for sushi. I enjoyed the egg and vegetable, although the vegetables fell out when I was attempting to eat this bursting at the seams roll. Messy yes, but definitely tasty. In summary, Akiko is a fine place for some Japanese food, but I&#39;ll probably venture somewhere else in the future, just to expand my options.

I&#39;m definitely coming back to this place! I am not much of a sushi eater (yet) but, decided to stop here anyways with the boss. We shared the ebi ten and spicy tuna roll. It was very fresh and none the less delicious! The owner was even throwing free sashimi at us after we finished our rolls to try and asked us if our food was good. The staff is very friendly and attentive and the restaurant itself has a nice chill vibe. Definitely recommend Akiko&#39;s and coming back soon!

Best sushi in the financial district, hands down. Service could be a little better but they are a small place. Great sushi and pretty reasonable. A good save for Kearny St............

this was my first sushi experience in SF. overall i enjoyed my meal, the rolls were a good size, the fish tasted fresh and was cold (the way i like it). i got there before the lunch rush, but even then the service was only pretty good. two things i didn&#39;t like: the prices and the fact that the waitress wouldn&#39;t give me a spoon for my miso soup.

if you like nabeyaki udon, here is another place that is quite good...with seafood and chicken....their soup is quite tasty and not the type that taste like you were swimming in the sea...if you like specialty sushi then you have to try their dynamite roll...it has good sauce and deep fried to a slight crispiness but just the rice was a big too mushy...but worth trying...very cute decor...but feels more like you are inside an italian restaurant...hehehe! sayonara

Love this place! Great decor and yummy sushi - try their firecracker roll which has a nice kick to it. All the sushi is good and fresh. The service and can be a little slow but this is one of my favorite sushi places in San Francisco!

recommended to me by my roommate, a coworker and i decided to get our sushi fix at akiko. it started out well. the place wasn&#39;t crowded at all (we went for an early lunch) and the atmosphere was nice, very cozy with a touch of modern charm. we ordered and were served in a reasonable amount of time, but once we got our food, we became non existant. waiter never came back around and i had to flag him down to attempt to order another roll. he just assumed i wanted the check, but i had to correct him and fenagle a menu from him. we ordered another roll, but this time the service wasnt so fast. sitting in front of the sushi chef himself, i thought it would be slightly quicker but no, 20 minutes later and no roll. the sushi chef asks if we want our check and we say no no we want another roll. waiter boy then suddenly remembers &#34;oh yeah, roll for them&#34;. nice one jr. 15 more minutes and we&#39;re finally served a decent tuna belly. they have good presentation and decent food, i just don tthink i&#39;ll be going back due to the lack of service. oh well.
