Pros: Food here was spot on. Drink was alright.. definitely interesting. They care a lot about their customers and do everything they can to accommodate.Cons: The place is small and has major acoustic issues-especially in the upstairs room. It&#39;s no fun having to repeat everything you say because it&#39;s so loud in there. Needs some fabric to absorb sound.

they accept reservations but then they dont honor them...Friend made reservations, we arrived on time. but we weren&#39;t seated until 40 minutes later...Their menu is superrrrr tiny. did not like that at all.brussel sprouts were yum, but i can make these at home pretty well myself :Pthrice cooked fries were good, but not sure if they were $10 good?pastrami sliders were most disappointing for me. Pretzel bun was yum, but the pastrami was soooooo salty, it was almost inedible.gnocchi was OK, pork belly was good, but not enough of it.food was honestly nothing special, and the whole reservations thing was annoying as hell.

Dropped by here randomly to kill time as we were waiting for Tacorea to open across the street (opens at 6 PM for dinner). And good thing we stopped by because, jeez, I found a place that does their fried brussel sprouts right! I think it might have been $6 for happy hour ($12 regular price) and the portion was HUGE! Probably twice the size of a normal appetizer. And it was fried perfectly. The &#39;fish sauce caramel&#39; (as they call it!), was in fact, a savory glaze that went perfect with the &#39;sprouts. FUCK. So good. I&#39;m drooling right now.We only had a beer and the brussel sprouts, but judging by their execution of it, their kitchen seems like they can dish out delicious items. I&#39;m itching for the next time I&#39;m in the area again so I can eat it again and try some other items.Props to the friendly bartender for not judging us for only getting happy hour items and still providing really great service! And to the free house-fried potato chips served in a cute li&#39;l mason jar!

Well, the 4 stars led me in the right direction.The service was great, the food was great! You should definitely try Happy Hour! 5-7 pm.I ended up having the Pork Chop.....OMG!A total yum-fest!Phil (the handsome one) and Kevin provided A++ service at the bar (very super attentive), and, Eric and Andy created that miracle called Kurobuta pork chop!Give it a try!

My family and I stumbled across Ailment on a Friday evening after several failed attempts to get a table for dinner. We were able to reserve a table on OpenTable and we were seated as soon as we came in.Unfortunately, I did not love the food and found everything to be incredibly overpriced. The menu was very small, and they didn&#39;t offer many of the dishes I saw on Yelp. We also weren&#39;t told of any specials. Between the five of us we ordered the Brussels sprouts, two burgers, pastrami sliders and tuna poke. The food was good and we had plenty to eat, but I thought everything was a bit over-seasoned and a bit over-salted.We were so hungry by the time we found a table somewhere for dinner so it served its purpose. But I would not recommend it, nor would I return if I&#39;m back in the city.

$26 for an &#34;entree&#34; of diver scallops that was literally gone in 3 bites? Feels like highway robbery. On top of that, as a large group, we had very slow and mediocre service because our tip was already automatically added to the bill. Was really hoping for a better SF dining experience to show my friends from out of town, and unfortunately, Aliment missed the mark on service, pricing, and overall sizzle. Hoping for some improvements because it&#39;s a nice space!

This meal was really good! First we noticed the decor and we were lucky enough to get a table on the top floor with a nice view over the bar and the restaurant with a big video screen on the wall.The Californian red wine was delicious (sorry I forgot which one it was, maybe with Syrah).Having read the reviews, we wanted to taste the Brussel sprouts, they were a lot and bigger than the usual Brussel sprouts we knew. The sweet caramelized taste was very nice.Then we had the gnocchis, nice but not amazing as I read elsewhere. And the scallops, which were extremely good and served over some black rice. This dish was smaller than the others but as we had so many Brussel sprouts we were not hungry anymore.Service was nice. We will try to come back next time!

Ahi Poke is suuuuper spicy, but no mention on the menu of any &#34;spicy&#34; ingredients. I could not eat the entire bowl, such a waste, honestly. Poke is one of my most favorite foods and I absolutely could not stand that this dish was pretty unbearable, when it came to the level of &#34;heat&#34;. Wholly molly, I could have drank an entire pitcher of milk with this dish. This place had so much potential because it had the freshest ingredients: bok choy, Chinese long beans and ahi tuna. I made reservations through Yelp for 7:15pm and upon arrival we were seated immediately and even given a choice of tables, when we walked upstairs. The waitress was super nice, but when I told her what was wrong with my dish, she didn&#39;t seem to care and kind of blew it off; she was even surprised I said it was too spicy. I told her that I couldn&#39;t continue to eat it and felt like I was going to die because it was so spicy. Oh well. That&#39;s one of the reasons why I never really express my opinions when the wait staff asks how things were. Even though the portions were a decent size for the price I paid, I was so disappointed because I could not even finish my dish. Will I be back? Sadly, probably not.

Looking for a good group dinner spot with tons of small plate options and a private dining space? Look no further. Aliment has got ya covered.I came in with a large group of coworkers last week and our dinner was nothing short of perfection. They sat us upstairs in our own semi-private area, and it was really nice to actually hear each other speak, which I feel like is rare in restaurants these days!We started off with a few rounds of small plates (and a few rounds of wine...duhzzz) and I think it&#39;s safe to say that we tried nearly everything. What was in the mix:-Sweet and crunchy Brussel sprouts. I was a bit nervous about the fish sauce, but it added a really nice flavor.-Kale salad with shaved parmesan-Salad with some sort of creamy cheese (tasted like a blend of goat and ricotta) with sweet potatoes. It was dressed in a sweet brown sugar dressing which I loved.-Crispy chicken bites coated in ramen. So unique!-Korean BBQ riblets in a sweet and tangy sauce-A pot of mussels (which they originally brought out because they heard that instead of brussels, and ended up letting us keep)After all of that...it was time for mains. I was honestly stuffed. Although the pasta bolognese and gnocchi sounded divine I was too full for a big bowl of pasta and ended up with another small plate, shrimp and grits.Very solid choice on my part. The smoked gouda grits were creamy and delicious, and sat beneath a heaping portion of baby shrimp and charred corn. They were absolutely not skimpy on the shrimp, and even though it was a &#39;small plate&#39; it easily worked as an entree.Whether you are with a large group or in need of a date night spot, Aliment is a solid pick for all occasions!

The space is incredibly sleek and trendy, and reminds me so much of London cafes/gastropubs. I adore the open kitchen design so you can eat/drink at the counter, or even on the first floor dining space, and watch the chefs in action. The owners have made a brilliant use of space with the overhead loft hovering just above the bottom floor seating area, and they don&#39;t jam tables and chairs together to maximize seating. Instead, parties are placed at comfortable distances.The food is phenomenal. Great for sharing tapas-style, you can get a bunch of small dishes for the table (and quite reasonably priced), or opt to have your own main. I enjoy how they have turned rather bland greens such as kale, Brussels sprouts, and artichokes into really spectacular eats. They tone down raw kale by shredding and tossing in a light cream dressing, and peppering with parm cheese. They flash-roast the Brussel sprouts and drizzle them in a sweet and syrupy &#34;fish sauce.&#34; They even have an interesting take on &#34;chicken nuggets.&#34; They take white meat bite-sized chicken strips and batter it in a mix of crumbs and crushed ramen noodles. Water glasses are constantly refilled, and the staff are consistently chipper and accommodating. Wine selection is sparse but sufficient, and you can enjoy full bottles at reasonable prices, or enjoy single glasses with incredibly generous pours.Although only open for dinner, it&#39;s well worth the wait for an evening meal. Would definitely return time and time again.

Came here for dinner on a Thursday night with some friends. The menu isn&#39;t big, which would explain why ALL FOUR OF US got the gnocchi. Ha. Never have I ever, but I really wanted it! pork belly gnocchi?!?! YES, please! Sadly the dish wasn&#39;t as good as I was expecting, just good, not great. We started with the brussel sprouts which were delish! The place is very cute and has a fun ambiance, some rowdy dudes pounding beers at the table behind us, but overall it was a nice time!

Nice little joint right here with window seating with windows that actually open. I initially came here and say upstairs with the fan directly pointing at me but it was too warm in SF (imagine that) that day so I had to move to a diff seat downstairs by the window. Now you understand my initial comment about where to sit.The Brussels sprouts were really good with toasted nori and some kind of fish caramel sauce that made me keep eating this dish. Did I mention that this was really REALLY good?Foie gras meatballs kinda lacked the foie gras. I guess the mixture maybe doesn&#39;t go well together because I couldn&#39;t taste it.Kale salad was a kale salad and didn&#39;t disappoint but wasn&#39;t as memorable as the Brussels sprouts.I would like to try some of the other items on the menu but I wasn&#39;t too hungry on this day so I&#39;ll update when I go back.

What happened to customer service? Apparently, there is 1 star worth at this restaurant.I called the restaurant to find out about some items on the menu...When I called to check the menu options, I was told the menu online was very detailed - okay, strike one, brush off my questions. Finally, I get an explanation of the chicken. Next, I ask if there can be an accommodation to the salad. Basically, I just need salad leaves and vinaigrette and nothing else, easy and fast right? I am told no accommodation can be made, the explanation being that this is a &#34;busy restaurant&#34; with no time to accommodate individuals. Strike two - here&#39;s my Yelp review.I&#39;m so disappointed by the rude customer service, especially from a host. I&#39;ve had accommodations made at 2 Michelin star restaurants - this place needs to step up their customer service game.

They say the way to a man&#39;s heart is through his stomach. Well I hereby revise that to say the way to my heart is through *your* stomach. As in Felicia over there was putting a spell on me by #solo ordering a salad then burger x fries. Buuuut she proceeded to eat like 1/4 of the salad, 1/2 the yurg, and an imperceptible amt of fries. Later she got dessert but #wgaf. #byefelicia #yagone #upwardsnapDishes sounded fleek on paper but mostly turned out funky, not in a good way.(^_^) Ramen Fried Chicken Bits $9&#34;Least off-putting dish of the meal.&#34;(^_^) Brussels Sprouts $10Sauce becomes intense at the bottom. #twss(-_^) Riblets $8Salty kimchi.

Wow, the brussel sprouts here were amazing, probably the best I&#39;ve ever had, but that&#39;s probably the only thing I can really rave about.Upon walking in, I was really pleased with the ambiance of this restaurant. It has an open ceiling, dim lighting, and rustic furniture, giving it a very nice and comfortable vibe for dinner. We ordered: 3 brussel sprouts (lol, yes, they were that good), mussels, fettuccine, and pork tenderloin. The pork was very disappointing - bland and not cooked well. Surprisingly though, the roasted vegetables that came on the size were cooked to perfection, and was definitely everyone&#39;s favorite part of the dish. If I based my review on the ambiance and the food, I probably would have given 4 starts overall, but well, let&#39;s talk a bit about the service that night.Upon ordering our drinks, our waitress put in all our drink orders, along with a martini that one of my friends ordered. Whatever drink came out was not a martini, so my friend nicely mentioned what liquors he was expecting to be in it and the waitress responded with &#34;I know what a gin martini is made with.&#34; Seriously? I don&#39;t know what sort of training she went through but from my experiences, you never talk to a customer like that in the food business. Strike 1.We also received bread that was really fresh and went well with the sauce the mussels came with. When we asked the waitress for a second order of bread, she did this really big hesitant sigh, looked at us for a second like she didn&#39;t want to give us more bread, then turned towards the kitchen and left. We thought it was odd but she did bring us a second basket of bread so we brushed it off. We finish up eating, and when the bill comes, I look through it and see a charge for extra bread, $4. If you&#39;re going to charge us for bread, at least tell your customers, and not just mischievously slip it in the bill. Strike 2.So this last part was what really just put me over the edge. I rarely give a place 1 star but this waitress gave us one of the worst dining experiences I&#39;ve ever been through. When she handed us the bill, she also said, &#34;Oh by the way, I took off the gin martini, it&#39;s on us.&#34; We all thought it was a very nice gesture as that&#39;s what a lot of places do occasionally when they mess up on an order. I look over the bill, and the gin martini is still there, so we call her back over and point out that the martini was still charged. She goes &#34;Oh I meant the first martini that was sent back to the bar, I know you didn&#39;t drink it but we still made you 2 drinks.&#34; Are you kidding me? Throughout my years and years of dining/bar experiences, I have never heard of anything like this. Why would you say you&#39;re comping the drink when the customer didn&#39;t even drink it........? Unbelievable, Strike 3.I really thought a restaurant like Aliment would have had better service, but it was truly a huge disappointment and I unfortunately will not be coming back here. Aliment, please do something to change the way your waitresses/waiters are trained as it really is hurting the business.

Nice dinner spot that is borderline expensive (entrees are within the $15-$18 range) but definitely worth it. The gnocchi, burger and brussels sprouts were quite good. The fries, however, were not.One very important tip: Don&#39;t sit in the upstairs back room. It&#39;s hot, stuffy and far removed from the energy downstairs. Make a reservation to avoid ending up in this closet.

Went to Aliment last night with a couple of friends after hearing about their good happy hour specials. We sat down only to discover that the specials are only available at the bar, we decided to move but the manager was really accommodating and said they would serve us from a table. We literally had 1 of everything on the happy hour menu and we were not disappointed. While all of the dishes were great our group was a huge fan of the mussels, Brussels sprouts, and the deviled eggs!There weren&#39;t many other patrons when we arrived at 5:45 but I could see it being a tight fit if it was a little more crowded. Otherwise the service was generally good and the drinks were strong!

I was honestly not that impressed with this place. I went with 3 other people so we tried a lot of things, and the only thing that was really good was the tomato soup that came with the grilled cheese.Pastrami Slider- It was good but not super amazing (3.5/5)Wings- Not a huge fan (2/5)French Fries- wayyyy too salty for my taste. Also not super crispy (2/5)Brussel Sprouts- these were good, good sauce, but I would like personally liked them a little crispier. However if I came here again, I would order them again (4/5)Scallops- Didn&#39;t love the sauce or the texture (2.5/5)Ricotta Gnocchi- I didnt&#39; want to add the pork belly but the other people didn&#39;t- i wouldn&#39;t recommend it. The Gnocchi was fine but not amazing (3/5)Originally we were going to try a burger, but were told that the burger can only be cooked medium well, which is way too overcooked in my opinion. I also thought it was weird that the chef couldn&#39;t cook it less, but our waitress told us that they had issues in the past of people sending it back because it was undercooked, so now the chef only cooks it medium to medium well. We couldn&#39;t even get it just medium.Wine- we got a bottle of the malbec which was good, and I also had a glass of the house pinot at happy hour. Wine was good and not ridiculously expensiveOverall- The atmosphere is cute, though kind of hipstery for my taste. Our waitress was really nice and accommodating. The wine was good and the price was standard for SF. However, I was really under impressed with the food and wouldn&#39;t go out of my way to come back here.

I got to eat at Alimentation a couple days ago, and i&#39;m so glad I did, despite the current star rating. Have no idea why it is only 3 1/2 stars.I sat at the bar and the bartenders were both very courteous and attentive. Apparently I didn&#39;t read the menu close enough and almost doubled up on the fries by ordering a side of fries with the burger (which isn&#39;t on the website menu, but was on the menu in the restaurant). Bartender pointed it out (the one that looks like Wash from Firefly) and so I ended up getting the Brussels Sprouts instead, along with the burger.The Brussels Sprouts were very very delicious, but the burger. Oh my God that burger. It did come with a large helping of fries, but that burger. Dat burger. I ate it as slowly as possible. I don&#39;t remember everything that the menu said was on it, aside from &#34;Bacon Jam.&#34;Nuff said.Well not really, but suffice to say that if you have the opportunity to go to Aliment, and you&#39;re deciding between the burger and something else, definitely give it a shot.

We were walking back home when we passed this place. We decided to stop by and share couple dishes here.The most memorable are:- Kale salad- Gnocchi, which were like little pieces of heaven. Luckily I also had a fresh jar of truffle salt that I just bought at the Ferry Building, and we indulged on this rich fatty flavour.Thankfully it was shared between two people which I think was perfect!Dinner for two with a glass fo beer and a glass of wine was just about $70.

Came here for dinner and everything I ordered was super spot on! I&#39;ve heard great things about their brussel sprouts too which was true. I love the atmosphere and the layout of the restaurant. It wasn&#39;t that busy on a Tuesday night around 8PM but they do take reservations as well just in case. They are open Mon-Sun for dinner from 5:30 - 10:30PM. It is also decently priced too and great wine list.Items that I ordered:- Fried Brussels Sprouts w/ fish sauce caramel, toasted nori, sesame seeds- Ricotta Gnocchi w/ english pea pesto- Lamb Sirloin w/ tatziki, harrissa, zatar spice**menu always changes

I really wanted this place to be better than it was, but sadly the food has yet to impress me. I first visited Aliment a couple of months after it opened back in 2013 and then again a few months ago. When I originally visited, I simply chalked things up to the place being new, but fast forward two years and I still felt that the food, especially considering the price, was underwhelming.That said, the decor is indeed modern and very appealing. I especially like the view from the upstairs dining area. The service was also great: the staff was extremely friendly and attentive. But, that only makes it all the more disappointing that the food doesn&#39;t live up to the rest of the package.

The food was really, really good. We had the pastrami sliders and I had the Korean style fried chicken. I removed a star because I am traveling with an 8 month old baby and they didn&#39;t have high chairs so I had to hold the baby or have her in the stroller the whole time. They do have a booster seat though for older babies.

Upon a recommendation by a friend, I dined at Aliment in a group of six, which turned out to be the perfect group size. We got one of each of everything except the burger, salads, and the butcher board. We also got extra of fried chicken bits, brussels sprouts, and steak, because they were our favorites of the night.To go along with the food, we got a bottle of the Samsara pinot noir and (I think) the Alexander Valley cabernet sauvignon. Both were wonderful and went very well with each of the dishes. Service was great and everything was wonderful. Highly recommend Aliment for a tasty dinner. Recap of dishes below:MUST HAVES:- Fried chicken bits: Small pieces of fried chicken. Not dry, lots of flavor, great crust. I also loved the pickles.- Riblets: Yum, so delicious! So juicy, tender, and flavorful. Arguably my favorite dish of the evening. The collard greens were great as an accompaniment.- Steak: Perfectly medium rare. Loved the chimichurri sauce and carrot puree. Portion size is pretty big too.- Pork belly: How can anyone turn down delicious pork belly? The kimchi was a great topping and I loved the crunch rice ovalettes.- Foie gras meatballs: Yum yum yum. Texture was soft and there&#39;s lots of flavor. The salad on the side was extremely lackluster though.- Brussels sprouts:JUST OKAY- Mussels: Compared to the other dishes, I thought this was just okay. It was yummy but not as interesting as some of the other offerings.- Pastrami short rib: I think the rest of the group would disagree with me and put it as a must have, but I didn&#39;t think this was as great as the other dishes. The concept was new and interesting, but the other meat dishes were better, IMO. The egg was awesome though.- Trout cakes: Kinda like crab cakes. It was delicious, but was slightly fishy, so that&#39;s why I didn&#39;t put it in the must have category.WOULD SKIP- Arctic char roulade: This was perhaps the weakest dish of the evening. The fish was overcooked and there wasn&#39;t enough flavor.- Gnocchi: There&#39;s probably better gnocchi elsewhere.- Lamb: It&#39;s not bad, but also didn&#39;t stand out. I would skip this and save room for the other meat dishes.

I came here with a friend before heading to a Josh Groban concert together, and I couldn&#39;t have asked for a better dining experience before our magical musical adventure. From the moment I walked in and took a seat at the bar, the bartender was extremely attentive, always making sure that I had a drink or appetizer in front of me while I was waiting for my friend.We ordered the brussel sprouts, which had toasted nori and fish sauce caramel. Probably one of the godliest-tasting brussel sprouts I&#39;ve ever had! SO GOOD. Would totally come back just to have these again. My friend and I split the Ricotta Gnocchi with pork belly and Lamb Sirloin with zatar spice. Both were amazing. I liked being able to share smaller plates rather than order large portions of food. Between the two of us, these three dishes (plus wine) were enough for a modest dinner so we weren&#39;t stuffed before the concert.Overall excellent service and food!

Came back after almost a year. Ordered the coho salmon again. This time it was perfection. Salmon was perfectly cooked. The black rice crispy, flavorful and delicious! They obviously isolated the dish bc this time there was no slaw but a green sauce that perfectly complemented the dish. So yummy! I could eat the salmon every night! But I won&#39;t bc I think part of the flavor profile is a ton of butter or ghee. Still so yummy. Highly recommend the salmon.

Aliment is a hipster-ish spot, with lots of delicious bar bites, small plates, a few great entrees, and a huge selection of wines, bubbles, beer, and now a cocktail menu too! It&#39;s one of our go-to date spots, mostly because it&#39;s so close and super convenient to call for a reservation, but also because we&#39;ve never been disappointed by the food. The staff is always very friendly, and you usually don&#39;t have to wait more than an hour for a table without a reservation. The entrees are around $20-40 each, but everything else is pretty much under $20. It&#39;s best to go family style and get a wide variety of the smaller plates to share here.They&#39;ve revamped the menu a bit, but my go-to dish is definitely the ricotta gnocchi (option to add pork belly). The mussels are also a great deal, usually around $15 and enough for 3-4 to share. And of course, you&#39;ve got to get the Brussel sprouts! If you&#39;ve ever had sprouts from Box, these are similar but a bit less oily. I wish they did take out so I could eat those sprouts every day!

We LOVED the spaghetti bolognese (generous serving, tender meat, fresh pasta), but the chicken could not have been more dry and the pancetta it came with was all fat.

Can&#39;t decided between 3 or 4 starsWent for dinner with my parents, who tend to be easy going but actually commented on the poor service.The food came out pretty quickly...Brussels sprouts -- my dad and I really liked them, but my mom thought they were a little too sweet. Don&#39;t hesitate to orderPork belly with kimchi -- hard to go wrong here... I&#39;d get it againFoie gras meatballs -- good combination of flavors and texture, definitely try itPastrami short rib -- good but a little on the dry side... I could go either way on this onePork riblets -- pretty average... I&#39;d pass next timeSmoked fish of the day -- everyone liked the first bite. The 2nd was ok. No one cared for a third... The saltiness caught up to us.

I moved to San Francisco about a year ago and this place has become one of my regular favorites. The food is consistently good, and so is the service. Most of the bad reviews for this restaurant seem to be from typical long-term San Franciscans who are looking for just about anything to complain about, or make themselves feel victimized.

Very sexy and inviting eating establishment nestled into bush street. I like many others had passed this place several times before deciding to make a reservation. I ate there this past weekend and overall it was a great experience.When you come in it is very crowded and loud like you would expect from most downtown SF locations similar to Jaspers or Fly Bar. It is dark and there is loud ambiance music blaring out downstairs. It was really busy on Saturday night so i would recommend making a reservation to ensure good seating.We were able to eat up stairs and it was much quieter and more romantic up there. Its a great place for couples and has an upscale vibe. The staff is very nice and knowledgeable as well.The food was very good, Aliment is an odd mix of american food that I couldn&#39;t figure out but it was unique which with all the other eating options downtown you probably need. My date enjoyed the brussels sprouts and the spaekle and kale were amazing dishes. I really just wanted to try a bunch of things so we ordered about 4 dishes including the cobbler dessert which was wonderful. I recommend actually saving room for dessert here.I didn&#39;t try any of the entrees so I might need to go back and check those out. Not really a casual dining place at night so I will wait for next date night. Overall great experience and not too expensive for downtown.

I really enjoyed my experience at Aliment. My boyfriend and I checked it out on a Thursday evening and were seated immediately (we also had a reservation). There are probably about 5 booths, a few tables, and 2 sets of bar seating facing the street and kitchen. Our server was cordial and pleasant.We ordered the brussel sprouts to share. Flavor was amazing - it was drenched in caramel fish sauce and reminded me of Vietnamese food. Also was cooked perfectly - they weren&#39;t undercooked (blech, bitter brussel sprouts) nor overcooked (crispy chips status). It&#39;s a really popular dish so when Aliment can make it at a consistent quality, it&#39;s worth trying.My boyfriend had the pork shank and I ordered the roasted chicken. The bone of the pork shank was huge, and the meat was fall-off-the-bone tender. Rich flavor and the side of German pasta (don&#39;t remember the official term) really complemented it. The chicken was good - the dark meat was juicy and tender. The white meat portion was just a bit dry, but the flavor was still there. I also really enjoyed the chard/polenta side. The next day, the chicken leftovers were even more delicious (maybe the flavor had time to sink in?). The portions were super generous - I made 2 meals out of my entree.Great spot for a date or small group of friends - reservations and Lyft ride recommended.

We had come here when they had just opened and had a fantastic meal then. However, tonight we decided to go back and it was a rather less exciting experience.The ambiance was the same, as expected, and the service was good, but the food was rather disappointing. We ordered the Harissa salad, which should have had some interesting spice but was instead rather bland; though the prosciutto was a nice choice. The mussels could have used a bit more broth and a bit of spice, but in the long run ended up being the most solid option. The bread served with them was described as delicious, but was the consistency of pound cake - which perhaps some dig, but I was not into. The steak looked delicious on the plate and was cooked as ordered, but was disappointingly tough and sinewy for a 28 dollar rare cooked cut. And the chicken and polenta tasted conspicuously of nothing at all.Bummer, as I dropped a days&#39; wages on essentially a C- meal made a C+ by service and decent wine.Will not return.

I brought my parents to try the food here with no real expectations, but it was ahhhmazingggg.Everything we had was delicious so I&#39;m just going to go over highlights. The PEI mussels were rather light on the meat but the flavor from the sauce is divine with Aliment&#39;s self described &#39;delicious bread&#39;. Even without the sauce, the bread is as they accurately labelled, delicious.The Seared Monkfish was delicious. Tender and juicy and served with the sweet potato hash and pork belly topped with almondine sauce makes this such a balanced plate of flavors.The butler steak. 8oz of cooked to medium perfection. Damn. They can cook good steak here.The Pork Chop... is a healthily large cut. It was so tender and flavorful and just gets amplified when paired with the apple ginger glaze sauce. The spaetzle it is served with is a great contrast for texture.Dessert was my favorite part of the meal. The Flourless Chocolate Cake (with brandy caramel and creme anglaise) is a solid classic dessert.My props though goes to the chef who came up with the Basil Panna Cotta (with black rice pudding and huckleberry jam). It was such an interesting experience eating it from the bottle vessel. But the balance of the panna cotta with the black rice texture and huckleberry jam and the mix of flavors has been the most yummy thing I have tasted in a while!

I am disappointed in myself that I didn&#39;t come here earlier. Walk by the restaurant everyday. This place is a gem. Whoever is back in the kitchen is slinging dope dishes. Everything was amazing: kale salad, short ribs, brussel sprouts, mussels, pork belly, bolognese pasta, carbonara pasta, and pretty much everything on the dessert menu BUT that chocolate ganache cake! Holy Shinto! Best cake ever.

Great addition to the neighborhood. Perfect for catching up with friends or eating as a solo diner. It&#39;s a beautiful new interior with a modern style.The food is all reasonably priced with respectable portions. I recommend the kale salad (very tasty. May be one of the best I&#39;ve had). The Brussel sprouts are a great starter as well.The halibut is probably the best entree. It is surprisingly hearty for fishService is fast and friendly. They check on you but don&#39;t rush you at all.I&#39;d come back.

This place had a nice ambiance and good staff. We were visiting from our of town and chose this as a dinner location based on the website which was misleading. Make sure you know which are entrees and which are small plates. Maybe since we viewed the website off the cell phone we didn&#39;t get the full menu, I&#39;m not sure but make sure you don&#39;t go there super hungry.

I want to like you, Aliment, I really want to. If you like New American cuisine, Aliment fulfills the entire checklist - high ceilings with balcony second floor seating, unusual flavor combinations, wooden tables, unconventional lighting structures, and waiters wearing berets and golden reptile skin shoes. They were also projecting Armageddon on one of the walls in place of wall decor (We sat right under the screen, and my friend summed up our experience pretty well: &#34;Armageddon is great, but I don&#39;t want to feel like I&#39;m being shot at during my meal.&#34;). I had high hopes that I had discovered the new gem of New American chic in San Francisco, but the food left me with mixed feelings.- Fried Brussels Sprouts ($9): Aliment seems to be Asian-inspired to an extent. Covered in a fish sauce caramel reduction, these sprouts are probably some of the best I&#39;ve ever had. The sweet and savory, Asian and American combination is unexpected and you&#39;ll find yourself rolling the sprouts around in the sauce because you just can&#39;t get enough of it.- Flatbread ($12): The dinner special was a burrata, kale, and tomato flatbread. Burrata is always great, no argument there.- Seared diver scallops ($17): I ordered this as an entree, but it can be shared as an appetizer. Three large scallops lie on a thin bed of black rice, thai green curry, and pickled shallots. The scallops are topped with a very unexpectedly spicy seasoning, and there is little relief to be found in the actual scallop meat and rice. There was a lot of different flavors clashing in the plate, and none of them seemed to mesh together peacefully.- Flourless Chocolate Cake ($9): Flourless cakes are usually an unsavory affair for me, but I really enjoyed how light this one tasted. It was topped with cream and caramel sauce.I enjoyed my friend&#39;s dinner special linguini with shrimp and lobster ($18) much more than my scallops, but I wouldn&#39;t say it was entirely unique. My other friend described her Roasted Chicken Breast ($20) as &#34;fancy KFC&#34; - perhaps a little harsh, but it was nothing too special either. I came with two friends on a Saturday night and there was no wait.Maybe the lack of impressive entrees that night unfairly marred our judgment of Aliment. But if nothing else excites you here, at least get the brussels sprouts!

3.5 starsAppetizers: The appetizers were great! I tried the pei mussels and the brussels sprouts. The mussels were light but very flavorful. I&#39;m not a big fan of brussels sprouts so I was kind of hesitant to try them but I was very happy I tried them. They are rich in flavor and very addicting. I could definitely understand why people were raving about them.Main dishes: I ordered the steak and the boyfriend ordered the chicken. The steak was pretty disappointing, I couldn&#39;t really taste much and the side salad dressing was a little too strong for me. On the other hand, the chicken was a lot better. The chicken was juicy and the corn that came with it was very delicious as well.Overall, service was great but I think it was a little pricey for the food. If I were to come here again, I would probably order multiple appetizers instead of ordering a main dish.

Doesn&#39;t matter if you have a reservation or not. If you are a couple you sit next to the restroom. We asked for an empty table in a better location that was the same size shape everything but they wouldn&#39;t seat us there. We were told that that was for a reservation. When we explained we had a reservation as well the staff was condescending and rude. We walked out of there and had a great meal elsewhere. Don&#39;t bother with this place. There are plenty of restaurants in the city that offer a good Friday night dining experience.Another thing to note is their online menu and prices are nowhere close to what you actually see on the paper menu. Classic restaurant bait and switch.

Did not get a good entry experience at this restaurant. They did not have host table or whatsoever, so we had to wait in the middle of the way while we were waiting for our table.They have good brussel sprouts.

Cool place but underwhelming food.This place caught my eye as I rode by and I stopped in for dinner. Everything looked great and I had high expectations, but everything I had fell short. I ordered the scallops, brussel sprouts, and apple pie. The scallops were pretty good, though nothing to write home about. The brussel sprouts were just not good; they were cooked appropriately but dressed in a sickly sweet sauce that was just completely inappropriate for sprouts. The apple pie was ok but a bit bland, and while my plate came out piping hot, the pie itself was oddly cold. I will not return.

Loved this place. Showed up at 5:30 when it opened on a Sat night and got a seat at the window. It has a cool vibe. This is a place to share small plates, and larger plates! Had good service- server made good suggestions and the food came quickly. Enjoyed the Fried chicken bites, grilled wedge salad, shrimp and grits, and gnocchi with pork belly. Would have liked to try the brussel sprouts but hubby not a fan - next time I&#39;ll get it anyway. Had a chocolate bundt cake for dessert which was just OK. But the other stuff was excellent . I hope to return if I ever get the chance!

Well! Not only did I enjoy solo dining at this sexy establishment (the Bolognese was a comforting choice, but managed to taste fresh and interesting) but a night that could have turned out tragically was saved...I left my purse at Aliment, but didn&#39;t even realise!It wasn&#39;t until Divine Daniel found me at the Hotel Rex Library Bar, called out my name, that I knew anything had gone astray! He personally delivered my wallet! I was absolutely floored! Such a triumph of humanity, I say. A marvellous example of a random act of kindness!I had less than 24 hours left in San Fran, I wouldn&#39;t have made it it back to Melbourne, Australia without my wallet.Thank you, Divine Daniel!PS wish that I&#39;d had an extra few stomachs, loved my pasta but had serious food envy over other peoples meals. Very jealous of the locals!

Good service, enticing menu, sleek modern vibe. The Brussels sprouts are as good as everyone says they are. We watched a lady come in and sit with a glass of wine while she waited for an order of sprouts to go. She said she dreams of them, and asked our server how they are made. He actually gave her the whole run down on the recipe. I eavesdropped, naturally, and will try it at home. (hint: deep fryer)They lost stars from me by over seasoning most of the food. Although the Brussels sprouts were on point, it was almost too generous a serving, better shared with 4 people than 2. Sometimes you can have too much of a good thing.My entree was the pastrami short rib. I conceptualized the dish in my head totally different than what it actually was, so I was disappointed by default (I imagined a beef short rib wrapped in pastrami...) The short rib was made of pastrami, and coated in an aggressive peppercorn rub. With no sauce on the plate to balance it out, I found the flavor to be too overpowering.My boyfriend had the steak. It was a generous portion, nicely done. I tried to take his plate but he held onto it.I might go back again to order something different, and after that, aliment will probably land closer to 4 stars. It&#39;s worth a second try.

If you advertise bottomless mimosas, I will be there. In my opinion, brunch just isn&#39;t the same without never ending glasses of champagne and OJ. In Aliment&#39;s case, they are referred to as topless mimosas, which makes the idea even more alluring.A group of four of us tried out Aliment for brunch on a Saturday and had a great time. It wasn&#39;t too loud, which brunch can sometimes be, so it was nice to be able to hear what my friends were saying. Or course, we ordered mimosas and the server did a pretty good job at keeping them refilled. Sometimes our glasses got completely empty (gasp!) but he wasn&#39;t too far behind on the refill. They don&#39;t bring pitchers and refill at your table, they actually take your glasses to the bar and refill them, which was a different mimosa experience for me, but still a fun one.I ordered the smoked fish benedict and really enjoyed it. Perfectly portioned and super fresh tasting. I ate every bit on the plate. My husband ordered the fried chicken and waffle balls and LOVED the chicken; and that man knows his fried chicken. He wasn&#39;t crazy about the waffle balls though.Our out of town friends ordered the french toast and burger. Our burger friend said it was one of the best burgers he has ever had, which I think is a huge statement! He was really excited about Aliment and can&#39;t wait to move to the Bay Ayrea. Aliment, you left quite an impression! I can&#39;t wait to return and try their dinner!

Went for Sunday brunch last weekend, which in this town it&#39;s a sport akin to Olympic competition to get the revered Sunday Brunch Reservation. Thankfully for Aliment, a quaint, quiet, Nob Hill joint, I was able to snag one the Saturday afternoon prior. The food is delicious, simple, unfettered and all around delicious. The beef shortrib hash is sumptuous and the potatoes that come with are sinfully savory. All in all, what more can I ask from a place that offers bottomless mimosas, has a great space, and solid service? Perhaps if they carried me home afterwards. But that might push me over the edge ;)

Great space and vibe. Our server, however, was not great. Four of us ordered drinks, and she only brought three to the table, walked away, and it took another 10 minutes to get her attention to remind her of the fourth. After telling us the specials, she sniffed that &#34;that&#39;s all I have to say about the food.&#34; It was clearly a bother to her that we were there to dine. Mussels and duck were excellent, but pork riblets were over-cooked and dry as a bone. One of the shared dishes we ordered never arrived. Donut and ice cream were worth the extra calories, though ice cream is a little icy if you prefer it on the creamier side. Server then proceeded to rush us out the door - we got more attention from her after she dropped the check than anytime during the meal. I&#39;d potentially go again and give a 2nd chance, but they need serious improvements in their service and there are too many other great options in the city.

Fab meal Monday evening. My date and I were both quite hungry, and shared the cheese/charcuterie (which was beautifully presented and was noticeably more chock-full of delicious bites than offered by any other restaurant in recent memory) and the pork chop. Perfect amount of food, and he&#39;s a big guy. The pork chop was seasoned perfectly for a barely-crisp exterior and was so tender and flavorful. I&#39;m still thinking about it three days later...They have large booths and a bar on the first floor, but they seat couples upstairs on a little half-terrace overlooking the first level, so there&#39;s no chance you&#39;ll get stuck in a corner or next to a wild/drunk group if you&#39;re just two people looking for a place to eat, drink, and chat. Polite, unobtrusive service.It&#39;s been open about a year now, and I am happy to have it as a go-to spot in the neighborhood.

Downsides:- Pork chop was extraordinarily fatty. Vegetables were over-cooked.- Almond and garlic soup was not particularly tasty; small portion size, too.- Salad dressing was too heavy.Upsides:- Brussel sprouts were amazing although the serving size is large, too much for a side dish for one.- Homemade ice cream was really good: vanilla and chocolate but also homemade mint chocolate (great fresh mint flavor) and &#34;pink peppercorn&#34; (unusual, spicy)

While visiting SF, we ate here twice and both times it was delicious! I am a picky eater so I usually have trouble at places like this, but I ate every single thing on my plate. The first time I had the Salmon dish which came with black rice that I just loved! My husband had the Butler&#39;s steak, which I tried, and that dish was also great. The second visit I had the Chilean Sea Bass, again came with rice but different and also delicious. My husband had the Pork Belly-again, awesome. I highly recommend Ailment from the food to the very chic atmosphere.

I got the chicken and it was way better than I expected, some spiciness, hearty, great variety of textures and flavors, well-prepared, and well-presented. Classic rock, silent movie on the wall, new favorite. The flower-less chocolate cake as well as the home made mint chocolate chip ice cream made from real mint reduction were great.

I hate to give Aliment a bad review as it&#39;s been a favorite restaurant of ours since it opened. So much so that my husband wanted to celebrate his birthday there last Saturday night. We were five people and spent more than $500. He accidentally forgot his birthday cards in the booth - including one with a $50 gift certificate to the Fatted Calf. We called to ask if they found the cards and they gave him a quick brush off and didn&#39;t even try to act like they cared. It was clearly our fault for forgetting the cards, but their reaction definitely put a damper on the special night. Re. the food, while the appetizers and desserts were good there were some entrees (like the rigatoni bolognese which was waaaay too spicy and the steak, which wasn&#39;t cooked to order) that really missed the mark. Sadly, I think the shine is off the apple.

Possibly one of the most complete dining experiences I have ever had. We started with the brussel sprouts and spaetzle. Brussel sprouts had a fish caramel sauce, so we were hesitant at first; however, they turned out incredible and an absolute highlight of the meal. For our entree we had the Steak, Gnocchi, and Bolognese. The Steak was cooked to exact specification and the pickled vegetables that accompanied provided an excellent flavor contrast. We concluded the meal with the cheesecake, made entirely in house. Could not be happier with the experience and will absolutely be coming back.

Couldn&#39;t be persuaded to try the Brussels sprouts although plenty of plates of them seemed to be going out. Aliment has a good selection of wines by the glass and they work well with the food, dominated by meat, although there are a few fish dishes too. The servings are reasonably generous and the execution is absolutely solid. It&#39;s a lively, noisy place and it&#39;s particularly good for groups.

We&#39;ve been to Aliment a few times now. The food is unique and vegetarian friendly. The place has a great neighborhood vibe but is still upscale. Consistently great food! We definitely have it on our favorite list.

Great brunch spot, especially on a nice day when they open all doors and windows. The vibe is just perfect. Very relaxed yet the staff is very attentive. If you are a foodie, you&#39;d love this place. We couldn&#39;t pick one item because we wanted everything :) tried their Benedict eggs with fish and it was delicious.

I&#39;m a huge fan of this place already, having eaten here about 4 times. Its cali comfort foo at best, with great veggie menu dishes to keep everyone at the table happy. The deserts are to die for. The chicken is mouthwatering, but my fav dish has to be the brussel sprouts.Ambiance is down to earth with nice lighting and no drama staff.Congrats on some great wines to pair too!Glad you guys have found your way to the neighborhood....

This is the kind of place we need in the neighborhood. Dan is awesome and I love the unique selection of wine they put together on the list. You really get to try some interesting things. Check out the dry sherry selection. My wife and I drop in for small plates and wine, and have done dinner at the bar, which is a great way to go here. The scallops and kale salad are some of our faves. Oh, and the spaetzle and cheese. Yep. Perfect comfort food done right. Keep it coming, Aliment!

The fried chicken was surprisingly boring but the brunch here is pretty impressive. With Sweet Woodruff down the block I don&#39;t see the point in coming here

We went here for brunch and the food was fantastic. We got the smoked fish Benedict and the biscuits and gravy. The wait staff was also very friendly and prompt with taking orders, getting refills etc.

Okay, so I live 2 minutes walking distance from this place and this is the first time I have enjoyed their atmosphere and incredible cuisine! Really, it was quite nice. Sat at the bar, service was great, and the wine, and the kale salad, and cavatelli was excellent. Prepared perfectly, light on the dressing for the salad (which is always good in our minds to not take away from the veggies) and al dente pasta with incredible ingredients and flavors. Well done Aliment! Glad to have you in the neighborhood! See you soon!
