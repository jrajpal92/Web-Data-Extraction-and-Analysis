Small little spot, the guys in the back are friendly and the food is generally ready so it comes out really quick. I had ordered just veggie items so I can&#39;t really comment on the meat items. There&#39;s plenty of seating though and serve yourself water in the back next to the napkins, silverware, and cups.I had ordered a spinach &#34;pie&#34;, and a falafel wrap. I wish I had asked for tzatziki or some kinda spicy dipping sauce since it doesn&#39;t really come with anything else. The falafel wrap was simple, but good. I wanted more veggies in there but I&#39;m assuming after reading some other reviews that anything extra that I might ask for would more than likely incur another charge for some reason. The spinach pie was like a pretzel that had spinach injected into the middle then heated up after. It is tasty but I don&#39;t know if I would pay the money for it again. For a buck more I get another wrap hahaha. Way more worthwhile to my stomach I&#39;d say.Because of the price and what would probably be an eventual need on my part to customize it at cost, not exactly my cup of tea I&#39;d say. Had better for better prices from many different places. It is simple and good but not great, and I wouldn&#39;t want to pay the difference to make it so when there are plenty of options nearby. I&#39;d probably check it out again due to proximity to work but wouldn&#39;t go out of my way for it imo.

I&#39;ve been here twice, both times to grab a bite before watching a show at the SHN Orpheum theater. It&#39;s literally a block away and very convenient!I ordered the lamb and beef gyro wrap which was good. It&#39;s decently sized and you could even share it with somebody if you aren&#39;t hungry. The owners/workers are all nice and friendly as well. You order and get a number and they bring the food to you. I&#39;ll prob be back if I&#39;m in the area again

Not the king of gyros. LOL.The ingredients are all there, but they&#39;re flavorless, so if that&#39;s your thing. Wrap isn&#39;t soft or warm, meat has no flavor other than a ground beef taste, and the tatsiki sauce taste like absolutely nothing.

This place was close to the Orpheum and we wanted to grab dinner before our show. I really wanted to like this place, but things didn&#39;t turn out that way. I ordered their king gyro salad and my BF got their gyro wrap, and we shared a slice of ravani.My gyro salad actually came with chicken instead of lamb, which was surprising since this was the first place I&#39;ve been to where gyro is chicken instead of lamb. The veggies in salad was tasty; nice, tart, and crisp. The chicken however was incredibly dry. It looked good, but overlooked I guess. My BF also thought his wrap was dry. He ended up taking my yogurt for his wrap. The ravani was interesting. It was soaked with a sugary syrup, making the cake really wet and sweet. Maybe it&#39;s me, but I&#39;m just not used to eating cake wet.Service was nice though. The people are really friendly.

Man, this spot is clutch. Love the lamb and beef gyro! One of my favorite Gyro spots in the city! Hands down, love the freshness, the lamb and beef are nicely seasoned. The hot red sauce on the gyro just makes things better. Everything on the menu looks good, and the service here is always quick. No fries though, I like fries with my Gyro, but even without it this spot makes it all worth it.

For the price:amount:taste:convenience, the chicken gyro was 3.5 stars. I&#39;m not someone who gets Greek food a lot (and if I do I hazard on the vegetarian side bc it&#39;s so amaze) but I was on the way to the Symphony (pinky raise) and I was hungry!I only had 15 minutes to eat, so I quickly got off Civic Center bart, walked a couple blocks to Gyro King (on the way to the Symphony), scanned the menu quickly, and ordered what I considered a safe option - the chicken gyro. For $7 it was quite the deal! They prepped it while I used their restroom (woot). Two minutes later, I was out the door.The bread was fluffy, warm, and dang tasty. The chicken was bland (and I tend to like slightly under seasoned foods)! I was so sad. Combined with a lackluster tahini sauce and salad items, it was only A-OK.That said, the convenience can&#39;t be beat! I go to the Symphony (pinky raise) 3x year and each time I&#39;m in a rush...so I will give this place another try and another try and another try. But next time, I will try the lamb or beef gyro.Btw, they also serve baklava, which looks so gud (what baklava doesn&#39;t?). I won&#39;t get it here though since I&#39;m close to Oasis in Belmont, which serves wholesale baklava, meaning 24 pieces for $8. I cannot pay $3 for one piece, GK, but perhaps YOU can.Anyway, try this place out and support your local musicians aka the renowned SF Symphony!

Before heading to a concert at the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium, my boyfriend and I realized we were starving. We looked around and saw this little place half a block away. We stopped in and were greeted by a very friendly gentleman behind the counter. All of their desserts and treats in their glass case looked so good but we decided to share a falafel wrap. I&#39;m glad we shared because it&#39;s huge! Also it only took less than 5 minutes to be served! They even split it in half and onto two plates for us which was very thoughtful. The sandwich was delicious and not dry at all. If I&#39;m ever in this area and want a quick bite especially before a concert I&#39;ll stop here again.

Me: &#34;What&#39;s the most popular meal sold here?&#34;Owner: &#34;.... HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA&#34;Me: &#34;Wait what&#39;s so funny?&#34;Not a good first impression. I&#39;ve never tried Mediterranean food, so I wanted to ask what&#39;s good for fucks sake. I ended up getting the lamb and beef gyro wrap that I found mediocre. It was the size of my forearm and it probably tasted the same as it would be if I actually ate my forearm - utter despair.The wrap was incredibly dry and flaky. The meat was juicy and sliced very thinly. It was overpowered by the dry wrap so the combination of the two was poor. The sauce was thin and liquid-like so it was dripping from my hands onto my plate. The vegetables were not evenly distributed, so I was only chewing on meat and wrap until I ripped it completely open to see the vegetables on the bottom. I was disappointed.I hate to give this places bad review. My company enjoyed their meals. They had the gyro on a plate and kebabs they enjoyed the side of bread they provided as well. Maybe I&#39;ll try that next time to give this place another chance.

Gyro King Indeed!Despite the well-presented, yet ultimately uninspired, salad, Gyro King soared to new heights in our office lunch fare.Their meats were exquisitely and surprisingly succulent, as if freshly cut from the gyroscopic rotisserie of a small Mediterranean street vendor&#39;s shop, dripping, sizzling, and crackling in its own savory juices. The spices were expertly chosen -- their recipe likely plucked from the lips of an old greek granny, a yaya if you will, deep in the roots of this family-owned business&#39;s familial tree.An interesting shock, their falafel sported new yet not unwelcomed flavors, unusual of falafels of caterers past.Long live the Gyro King! My tastebuds stand his loyal subjects.

Wonderful customer service, great food, and quick eats. Boyfriend and I ran in here before watching a show at the Orpheum and were in and out in 25 min. We each had a wrap, one falafel and one lamb shish kebab. Both were delicious though I wish mine had some raw onions in it, just as a personal preference.What really put this place over the top was the owner. We chatted with him a bit about the homeless problem right outside of his store and it&#39;s very clear that the guy has a big heart. He said they often give free meals to those outside but that feeding the people cannot solve all of the problems they have. While I completely agree, I respect that he does what he can.Until next time Gyro King...

Really delicious Mediterranean food! Ate here on the way to the opera, and it was a great start to the evening. Nothing fancy here... crowded little place, maybe a dozen or so tables. You walk by many of the dishes being served in a glass-front case on your way in the door. We had several kinds of kabobs, and all were tender and very flavorful. The appetizer plate had a great variety of dips, dolma, and olives; all were wonderful. Next time I&#39;m in the area, this will be a must-visit.

This place is pretty good value. The meat plates are a generous amount. The appetizer combo plate is as good as an entree, especially if you are indecisive. It has a little of everything. Many of the dishes also come with a raita, pickled cabbage, and cucumber salad, which are excellent and refreshing sides. The tabbouleh and white bean salad are good too. All of which has a nice level of acidity. The dolmas are pretty good here too. I love both the baba ganoush and hummus, very creamy texture. Also creamy is their yellow lentils soup. They also have complimentary housemade bread for most dishes. It&#39;s the same bread used for the pies, which is my go-to. They are savory, easy for transport, and a good size for the price, though I have to warn are bready. I would recommend the gyro pie, but all pretty good.The restaurant itself is very close to Civic Center BART. The service is pretty quick and there is lots of self-seating. It&#39;s a very casual setting.

I was prepared to give it a 5-star rating when I went in to order tonight&#39;s gyro; a combo(lamb &amp; beef w/chicken) for $6.75. Again a great value for this delicious, wellpacked gyro! I had to deduct 1-star though because some of the chicken was a bit over done &amp; dry.killCome in guys, Watch that chicken!! You should know when it&#39;s too dry to use. I hope next time to still enjoy my gyro even more!&amp; PEOPLE!! It&#39;s unfair to give this place a low rating just because of its location.

Lion King (me) meets Gyro King; the Civic Center Mediterranean restaurant that specialize in Gyros.I may not be a fearless feline like Mufasa or be as cute as his son, Simba. But I do have the looks and appetite of Pumbaa (the cute boar) to dine here (Watch the damn Disney movie yo&#39; self, if you had no idea what the heck I&#39;m talking about).Also I&#39;m heroic enough to dine here too.A gyro and a burrito have identical features- &#34;big and meaty&#34; in a dough. No, I still know they are both different. But they are both made for an appetite of a lion.For $6.25, I had the Chicken and Lamb Gyro. This wrap has pieces of grilled chicken and lamb, chopped tomatoes, parsley, hummus and a tangy tzatziki yogurt sauce in a warm grilled flatbread. The meats were lean and grilled very nice. This Gyro is just as good as a burrito, but different.I was hungry that day and also ordered a plate of Tabbouleh salad for $3.50. The Arab salad just came out of the kitchen as I placed my order. The cooked bulgur grain mixed with other vegetables including the overpowering amount of mint is an aromatic salad is a must have. And for the price, you will get a good amount. Ordering the salad was a bit excessive for lunch, but I was desperate because the salad was just cooked and made fresh.Okay, I do have the appetite of Pumbaa.Credit Cards are accepted here.And the Health Department score is 92. &#34; Yeah, you are at a jungle at Civic Center!&#34;

Great friendly staff. It&#39;s family owned. The dynamic feels like family (and this works in the restaurant&#39;s favor) making it homey, warm and welcoming. The daughters take your order, father cooks the meat and mother brings the food to your plate from the kitchen.The food is consistently good.The red lentil mint soup with lime was delicious; as was the lamb kebab.My friend ordered the kebab combo (which comes with a skewer of chicken and a skewer of lamb and he said the lamb was by far better).White bean salad with vinegar dressing also looked amazing, though I didn&#39;t try it. If you are vegetarian they have many option that are hearty and filling.The pies must be amazing cause they were sold out by the time we got there for dinner. The baklavas and other desserts were shiny and inviting though we were too full to order them.Humble decor.Broken restroom (even for customers makes this a bit of an inconvenience if you want to hang for longer than a while).At Gyro King, you&#39;ll get a pretty good meal at a reasonable price.

The only good thing about this place is the low price of the food, but in my opinion, you get what you pay for. I like that Gyro King is spacious and close to the Orpheum Theater (which is why I came here in the first place) but the food and service were okay. I ordered the beef and lamb gyro but it was pretty much tasteless, even with the tzatziki sauce inside. The only thing that made it better was the hot sauce I had to drench it with. It was bearable enough to eat most of it, but I would not give this place a second chance.

GK is not a place to linger as it is located on the gritty border between the Civic Center and the Tenderloin. However, it&#39;s a cheap alternative to typical fast food. GK is located just across the street from the city&#39;s main public library, around the corner from the Orpheum Theater and just a few blocks from the Asian Art Museum, Davis Symphony Hall, City Hall, the War Memorial and the Opera House.On this particular visit, we were hurrying to the opening night performance of Motown, the Musical. I went outside my comfort zone and tried the adana kebab platter. The kebab is minced lamb shaped around a skewer before being grilled. It sort of reminded me of a deformed meatball or flattened sausage. The flavor wasn&#39;t bad but I had to eat it with sauce to combat the dryness. The salad and the rice pilaf were OK. I didn&#39;t care for the bulgar wheat. It was dry and crunchy. I really enjoyed the lemony hummus and the fluffy bread, reminiscent of focaccia.There are plenty of fancier places to eat in the area, but if you are pressed for time, GK is a the place to grab a quick bite before enjoying the myriad attractions around the Civic Center.$10.95 Adana platter with 1 skewer, salad, rice pilaf and bulgar wheat salad$2.50 Orangina bottled orange drink$1.18 Tax---------------------------------------------------$14.63 Total

I am sad to say that I am not a fan. I&#39;ve been searching for a good gyro in the Civic Center area and was excited to finally try Gyro King... but after my disappointing lamb gyro yesterday I&#39;m not sure I will be back.My main complaint is the quality of the meat. It completely lacked flavor. Maybe I should have gone for the chicken? The gyro was pretty plain and would have been better with some hot sauce on it.I will say though, the guys working here were really sweet to me. After reading other reviews I was not expecting them to be so friendly. The guy behind the counter offered to let me try a half and half gyro with chicken and lamb.. I didn&#39;t take him up on it, but maybe I should have!

Decent enough for a quick grab and go. They are routinely busy, which is good. But they routinely leave items off the dishes as well. If the salad expressly says it has olives and cucumber, perhaps at least one of each would be considered necessary?Still, the amount of food is good, the quality is decent, and the staff friendly. Not bad for a spot between skid row Burger King and the urban gym.

Second, a warm and toasty spinach resembling a pretzel stuffed with tender spinach.There&#39;s often a line out the door around noon, but it dies down by 1 pm.

Mediocre food and service is a bit unfriendly. The meat was not marinated. The place didn&#39;t have hot sauce to make the Adana kebap roll taste better. Don&#39;t have much to else to say- won&#39;t be coming back.

Simple quick and yummy food - this last weekend they forgot a few of the wraps we ordered to go - a few days later Nuri offered to have us swing by to pick fresh ones up - I had the baby and he even dropped them off at my car; super thoughtful.

Disappointing. I got the lamb and beef gyros wrap, and while the bread and salad were tasty, the meat was greasy and didn&#39;t taste very fresh. I didn&#39;t finish it, despite being hungry.Service was great and I wanted to make this one of my go-to places, but I don&#39;t want to eat that meat again. Maybe the chicken is better?

I had no idea that a restaurant could screw up falafel&#39;s so badly. It was a terrible experience. The cooks weren&#39;t wearing any gloves and the guy who made this falafel sandwich was using his hands to run the register and do other things. I will probably never return to this place

(See pics)Popular place to grab a delicious gyro, kebab, baklava, etc. It&#39;s at a perfect location with Civic Center, the library, right by the Muni/Bart/bus stops. People come by when they are being picked up by friends from the station, groups who are getting a couple dozens wraps to go, and those who want to stay and enjoy a break from all the commotions outside.

Don&#39;t know if this place is quite deserving of the title Gyro KING. Maybe more like a duke. Or baron.Came here after exiting the BART station. I was starving, but didn&#39;t want to go to Burger King, so I decided to give this place a try! The decor is pretty cool! I liked the home-y feeling, but the people working here were anything but. None of the guys were smiling and they weren&#39;t friendly. Granted, they were efficient though.Anyway, the food was pretty good. I got the ezo gelin soup (I think it&#39;s lentil?) and the chicken gyro. I personally liked the soup better than the gyro; tastier and it was worth the price (only $3.50!)It&#39;s not that the gyro was bad, it just wasn&#39;t amazing. There was enough sauce inside, so it wasn&#39;t dry! And they didn&#39;t skimp on the protein! Whoo!I think I need to try some of the platters because from the looks of other reviews, those seem to be better deals and the food is better?

I found this place while attending some concerts at Bill Graham Auditorium. A family establishment. And they are not only friendly the food is authentic and has a great ethnic quality. The chicken gyros are awesome. Easy in and easy out. Food is worth stopping by for. And I will definately be eating there today since I&#39;m passing through the area.

This is some of the most bland middle eastern food I&#39;ve ever tasted. It&#39;s like they didn&#39;t have any lemon or salt on hand.People seen to like their sandwiches so maybe it&#39;s ok if you order one of those. I got the veggie combo and it was just terrible. I picked at it for a few minutes and then just got rid of it.

Gyro King--what happened to you?!?!? Boy, have you changed over the year.Your employees &#34;use to&#34; take their time to make the food. And, your Gyros &#34;use to be&#34; nice and toasty outside and filled with flavorful meats inside.Today, I got handed my Combo Gyro (chicken, lamb, beef) in 2 minutes flat; I didn&#39;t even make it to the cashier yet and it was ready (there were 2 customers in front of me). Now I know why it was ready so fast...The lavash bread was not grilled, so it was cold. And, the meat inside was also cold b/c it wasn&#39;t grilled beforehand to warm it up. The chicken was dry and bland. The beef was chewy and hard. Not sure where the lamb was b/c I didn&#39;t find any in my wrap. The tahini sauce was tasteless and watery.Perhaps, the meat was pre-cut and sitting out there, hence the dryness. And, when a customer orders, it&#39;s just thrown in the lavash bread, and rolled up?I guess you have decided to sacrifice taste and quality for speediness. Too bad...

I come to Gyro King whenever I&#39;m craving a burrito- this is the healthier version in my opinion.The last time I ordered a chicken gyro I wasnt too impressed. The chicken was really dry but the portion was huge. I didnt remember it being dry before, so maybe they were just having a bad day? I&#39;ll give them the benefit and will try again next time.Note: Line forms during lunch hours and inside seating gets crowded.

After visiting Gyro King several times (and finally remembering to write a review about it)--I have to say the place is just....ok.The place is Turk-owned with posters up of Turkey and the names of some dishes in Turkish. Oh, but their menu offering is typical of what you&#39;d find at any Mediterranean place: gyros, salad, dolmas, etc.What I like best are the desserts (they can get a little too sweet with the syrup though) and the kebab platters.My friend once told me that the way they prepare the gyros here is the Turkish way, not the Greek way that most Americans are familiar with. Still....I don&#39;t like the gyro wrap so much here. The wrap is toasted to the point that the ends are burnt and crispy. I like my gyros with a fluffy soft wrap, perhaps, the Greek style.But, for the price of approximately $5-$6 for a gyros, you get a lot--a burrito-sized gyros, if I may be so blasphemous. It&#39;s nicely wrapped up in foil so you&#39;re not spilling all the contents on yourself at the table. They don&#39;t put much sauce in the gyros though...Anyway, the kebab platters come with a lot and they&#39;re worth the money of approximately $10. Drinks are in the back refrigerators, so serve yourself. Service has been polite and fast, so I can&#39;t complain about that aspect.Gyro King is convenient for those who visit the SFPL or the Asian Art Museum...or for those who happen to work in the area and use the BART/Muni stop nearby.

This is a wonderful Turkish establishment that is underrated. I usually head here after a work out and get the Greek salad with gyro meat and feta dressing - it&#39;s tastes amazing! And the owner is incredibly nice and loves to take care of customers. Over all a great place to stop by and grab a quick bite for lunch. The bread is amazing too!

This is a good option for a hungry halal soul. If you go to the fantastic library stop here for lunch or early dinner.The food is more Turkish than whatever yelp says. The owners are always there and only a couple of the men are friendly. Otherwise just order (don&#39;t say please), pay, take your food (without saying thank you) and you&#39;ll be fine. No one will notice.If you are a guy you can chit-chat with the girls if their uncle or dad are not around. They are friendly and may be glad for your business.Enjoy!

I ordered the beef and lamb gyro.The portion size was pretty good for $6.50. The bread was a little too thin and the meat was kind of dry, but my issue was with the service.The grey haired man w/ glasses behind the counter seemed very annoyed that I asked what was on the gyro platter, and even more annoyed when I asked him to put feta on my gyro. How do you eat a gyro without feta anyways???Sorry, but im kind of a stickler on service, and I won&#39;t return to a place that makes you feel like they are doing you a favor by serving you.

With a name like Gyro King you&#39;d think they&#39;d get THAT right. I stood by the &#34;Order Here&#34; sign and was ignored for a while. I wasn&#39;t texting, I was looking at everyone. So I get to the counter and order a Lamb Gyro (I even pronounced it properly) to go. The gyro I got came out VERY quickly. Like, suspiciously quick. To my surprise it was a bland, dry and chewy gyro. The meat tasted like chalk, the lettuce was wilted. No onions, no tomatoes. The tzatziki sauce had a consistency of water, and really didn&#39;t taste authentic to me. And the pita was thin and hard.I&#39;ve eaten TONS of gyros in my day. I love em, they&#39;re probably one of my favorite sandwiches, however; this was quite possibly the worst one I&#39;ve ever had. I cannot say I&#39;ll ever be coming back. It&#39;s a shame too, because I was looking forward to going here.

The chicken gyros is the bomb! They gave a good amount of delicious chicken chunks, veggies, and tzatziki sauce. Tried their lamb kebab as well but I&#39;m not too fond of it because of the lamb smell.We couldn&#39;t find seating for 3 people and the cashier guy helped us finding an extra chair for the small table. He might not smile a lot, but he&#39;s super helpful! Although because of helping us, he ended up creating a very long line in the register.

Gyros, Kebabs, and Dolmas oh my! The gyro king is a little hole in the wall situated near Civic center. I usually get the platters (I try to avoid the abundance of carbs). The chicken entree is my favorite. It&#39;s seasoned well and the portions are pretty good. They also are pretty good with substitutions with no extra charge (I feel like the salad is a waste of a side). One thing I&#39;ve been seeing is that people have been saying it&#39;s pretty cheap. I think it&#39;s a little pricey. It&#39;s good but not sure if it&#39;s worth what they&#39;re charging. The place is worth trying though.

In San Francisco, good food doesn&#39;t cost a fortune if you know where to go.It was a day of solo exploring.I hopped on Bart toward Civic Center for Asian Art Museum.It was around 1pm inside the Museum. I was hungry - but the over priced menu - for its fancy presentation and location but an unfit long self help ordering line - just wasn&#39;t for me. I left.I walked toward the Public Library on Grove - then I saw this eatery just across the street.The wait line wasn&#39;t too bad. Inside the house was almost packed with customers, the mood was welcoming.While waiting in line, I picked up a &#34;To Go&#34; menu - total 45 items - which offers cold appetizer plates, soup, salads, homemade pastries, wrapped sandwiches, specialty platters and desserts.I then select #9 Ezo Gelin Soup $3.50A bowl came with homemade bread and two sliced lemon.it&#39;s a well bland red lentil, mint, black pepper, salt, oregano, and tomato paste soup. It&#39;s light yet rich in flavor - add a few drops of freshly squeezed lemon juice - wow heavenly satisfying.Seeing a lot customers eating wrap sandwiches - so I want to try.#22 - Lamb &amp; Beef Gyros $5.95It&#39;s about 10&#34; wrap in bread with tomatoes, cucumber, onion and tahini sauce. - The meats were a little bit dry. The highlight of the wrap was its homemade bread - it baked right so it crunches when bite down.For my next visit, my selection will be for their specialty plates - they looked colorful, interesting and appetizing.

i mistook this place for another place that i had read great yelp reviews about- my bad. My lunch sucked. The chicken gyro (which you would think would be the best item given their name) consisted of 4 ingredients:- dried up chicken,-dry gigantic lavash wrap,-watered down tzatziki sauce,-and lettuceno feta cheese, cucumbers, tomatoes, pita..etc...- it left much to be desired.... but perhaps the biggest let down was the soggy baklava - it was dripping and even though it&#39;s one of my all time favorite desserts i just couldn&#39;t finish it.

I wanted to like this place, I really did. But overall, I was disappointed. First off, after you give up circling around Civic Center hoping for parking, you can always park at the underground parking lot for about $3 an hour. Then, you can journey the few blocks making sure you don&#39;t step on one of the several cracked out homeless bums lining the sidewalk. How are there so many bums a block away from City Hall? Blows my mind.Anyways, after you step into Gyro King, look over their very simple menu containing platters, cold appetizers, and of course, gyros. They do have the full rack of lamb and beef that are freshly carved when ordered. Since it&#39;s called &#34;Gyro King&#34; we ordered 3 gyros: one beef and lamb, one chicken, and one combo (beef, lamb, and chicken). They were a little over $6 a piece so not bad. We also ordered fresh baked pita and hummus for...$4.75?! It&#39;s gotta be good right..?No...it wasn&#39;t. The hummus was pretty good. Flavorful yet still light with a creamy texture. The pita, which is &#34;freshly baked&#34; was cold and did not taste as advertised. Also, they give you a piece of pita the size of a piece of toast and cut in into three strips. I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s cause I&#39;m Asian, but if I&#39;m paying $4.75 for some bread and dip, I expect a whole lot more pita! The gyros were also disappointing. Although large and filling for the price, the meat was almost unbearable. All the meats were flavorless and overcooked. The lamb and beef, as a result, was tough. So you have this gyro with lettuce, tomatoes, yogurt sauce, and flavorless/overcooked/tough meat. What a shame... Being Asian again, I ate it anyways. I walked out unsatisfied and vow never to return here again.Oh yeah, two stars for having free tap water?

I&#39;m surprised I didn&#39;t get food poisoning here. The whole time I was eating, I just felt lack of effort in the food, the execution and health sanitation. My sampler platter was cold, sitting in the fridge, had very very oily components &amp; the only thing I really enjoyed was their bread. Yes it is cheap, but hell, I&#39;d rather pay an extra couple bucks for something memorable and won&#39;t leave me worrying if I&#39;m gonna get the shits later.

I am from the Middle East so I crave Mediterranean food alwaysI have tried many Mediterranean restaurands before but Gyro King made the difference.I will rate this place based on two things: food quality and cleanness. What can I say, Lamp/Beef Gyro, Adana Kebab, Shish Kebab or the amazing types of salads! or my favorite desserts from Baklava to Kadayif!The food is beyond my expectation of deliciousness and freshness. The food is simply super delicious.The place is super clean and the seats and tables look just fine to me.I think the owner who seemed unfriendly with no smile on his face knows how to run his business and I cannot give this place less than 5 stars.

Great place in the area for something fast and simple.For about six dollars you can get a large gyro with a great tangy yogurt sauce and juicy seasoned meat. The Wrap can sometimes be a little dry but I&#39;m always happy with it.Their meat plates are delicious and come with a salad and giant portions of meat, also with the great yogurt sauce. Nothing spectacular about the bread, maybe if it wasn&#39;t cold but it&#39;s good enough.Perfect for a quick lunch and way better than Burger King which is right next to it.

I work near here. I mostly like it. They make a quick but uninteresting shawarma. They have a good combo appetizer when I need to give my staff a break from normal.Someone earlier mentioned &#34;the guy with gray hair and glasses,&#34; -- that guy is cool as school. He looks like a schoolteacher, a barber, an archeologist, a brilliant scientist or a fairly decent friend. This is a man who delivers, so please show a bit of respect.

If you read the reviews, there&#39;s a consensus that the gyro sandwiches are dry and lackluster. I had the chicken gyro the other day and couldn&#39;t agree more. Something was definitely missing. There was sauce but it was watery...and the chicken lacked any real defined flavor.Otherwise, this is a good cheap place to eat for a quick lunch. Big portions. The people who work here are really friendly but perhaps they need to figure out a new recipe for their wrap sandwiches.I would only come back for the spinach pie.

For reasonably priced Mediterranean food on the go, this place is definitely worth a stop if you&#39;re in the Civic Center area. But don&#39;t bother actually sitting down and eating during a typical weekday lunch hour. It&#39;s a zoo, and the customers are much ruder than the staff there, especially as they gun for the precious few tables. I should know since I tripped an old lady on her way to MY window seat. She asked for it, I tell ya.While the hummus and baba ganoush have good homemade flavor for $3.95 each (with pita bread, of course), it&#39;s really the gyros I go after here. The $5.50 beef and lamb gyros combo sandwich is a good deal - quite a huge lavash slathered in tahini sauce and filled to the brim with tasty shards of beef and lamb, cucumber chunks, tomato slices and diced onions. The meat was a bit more charred than I like, but it is quite a handful...and you won&#39;t have room for the baklava, so just forget about it.FOOD - 4 stars...good homemade MediterraneanAMBIANCE - 2.5 stars...lunch room vibe, way crowded at lunch hour...and no room to break plates and do my Zorba danceSERVICE - 3.5 stars...fast with attitudeTOTAL - 4 stars..barely four stars and really for the gyros...but plan to seize and attack if you want a table at lunch

Though this place is decent, I was not as impressed as the Yelp reviews made this place seem. All things considered though it&#39;s inexpensive for what you get. I could have easily gone in halvsies on a gyro -- had I know they were going to be monster wraps. I probably won&#39;t go here often just because I know I can&#39;t finish a gyro. Not to mention there is a Mediterranean restaurant closer to my office near 7th-ish street.Moral of the story: If I&#39;m in the area I might go again...but I&#39;m not drooling over my experience.Oh and one more thing: the guy at the cash register was scary and mean.

I can&#39;t believe I haven&#39;t written about this place yet! First, any place with good, freshly made baklava is OK in my book.Gyro King is a couple blocks away from my office so I eat here a few times a month for lunch. I always got the lamb and beef or the combo gyro wrap, but lately I&#39;ve been hooked on the falafal wrap (I love me some good falafal!). Oh, and did I mention they have yummy baklava?Great food, good service, decent prices. This place makes for a good lunch on the fly!

This place is deserving of at least 4 STARS. One of the best bang for your buck places in SF. I was more than satisfied with the quality of food, and the portions are enough to fill you up if you have a big appetite.I ordered their Chicken Kebab Specialty Platter which comes with a nice size salad, couscous, rice, AMAZING cucumber yogurt sauce, and bread that is hot and fresh. All of this was $10 including tax.The Chicken was moist and had a great flavor to it. The salad was fresh and tasted clean. The bread was good; however, the edges were a little hard, but if you ripped off the edges the rest was delicious. The best part was the cucumber yogurt sauce. It was so good I had to ask for another one, and they gladly gave it to me for free.Overall, this place offers up some good Mediterranean food and has a lot of room for large parties of people. Definitely coming back here.

Decent but not amazing. I had the falafel wrap sandwich and unfortunately it lacked in flavor. The falafel was crunchy and there was a decent amount of it but it did not have enough flavor for me. I also wish there was hummus inside, not just tahini. Lavash wrap was also dry and powdery.My co-worker had the appetizer combo and that looked tasty. The line did move fast and everything was well priced.

I got the lamb and beef gyro and the chicken kebab platter for my daughter. the gyro was more like a shawerma since it was on lavash instead of a pita and rolled in a long shawerma-like tube, both of which i can overlook, but the meat! the horrors! it was dry and tough, i could barely choke it down, even after adding more tzatziki. it was so bad, i only ate half of it...and i don&#39;t ever leave food!the chicken kebab platter was good though. the chicken, salad, pickled cabbage and rice were all good, as well as the bread they served with it. and our food came pretty quickly. the proximity to the theater was the other good thing. i don&#39;t think i&#39;d be so negative if it wasn&#39;t called &#34;gyro king.&#34;also, even though the bathroom has a sign that says it&#39;s out of order, it&#39;s not.

Absolutely loved this place! I travel quite a bit all over the United States and this place is most definitely somewhere I would come back to! Service was great, portions were large and everything we ate tasted amazing. The food did take a while to arrive to our table but it was because everything is made fresh. The meat is marinated all day. We had chicken kabobs and lamb gyros. My 4 year old son almost finished his entire plate! Rice, salad and two kabobs! I highly recommend this place!

A good place for a quick bite if you&#39;re on your way to a concert nearby. Friendly service (the owner brought our food over and insisted we eat and take our time before paying, which was sweet) and decent food at a low price. I wanted to order the spinach pie, which I&#39;ve always loved in Greece, but it wasn&#39;t available, so maybe worth coming back for lunch sometime instead to see if it&#39;s on the menu then. The chicken was tasty, as was the tabbouleh. We took a couple of squares of baklava to go, and they were good too.

My roommates and I are new to the area, so we stopped by this place (right by Burger King) one lunch and decided to try it out. I ordered a lamb kebob, which wasn&#39;t bad at all, but I found it to be a bit bland and had to resort to salt &amp; pepper to season things up.The decor is nothing to write home about, though the seemingly intentional juxtaposition between the wall paintings of Golden Gate Bridge and some bridge in Batman, Turkey, is a little funny. Don&#39;t expect to watch TV here unless you speak Turkish as the only set seems to be always tuned to CNN Turkey. For a quick lunch, go for it, otherwise skip this venue for other alternatives.

In a town with so much culture how is it impossible to find a decent gyro? Its beauty is in its simplicity. Lamb, tomatoes, onions, and Tzatziki wrapped in a fluffy ass pita. (Cucumber is the only acceptable addition)It is not served in a tortilla with lettuce! I am not even close to being Greek and I want to have you shipped back to Athens for a brush up class. Do you know how embarrassing it is for the west coast that I have to go all the way back to Lafayette Indiana for a decent Gyro? Please please someone tell me where I can get my fix

When it comes to crunch time @ work, I only get 30 minute lunch. I know, it&#39;s the saddest thing ever. Usually I get a full hour and it takes me 20 minutes to decide what I want in the first place!Anyway, last friday I had 30 minutes, no cash, and desperate for a place that would take ATM. I had already wasted 15 minutes trying to decide between Burger King and McDonald&#39;s, so BK it was. On my way there, I passed by Gyro King.Remembering the day an awesome Yelper brought me pita bread and tabbouleh from Gyro King, I silently prayed a &#34;thank you&#34; as I saw the Visa/Mastercard sticker on their doors and ducked inside.I forgot the name of what I ordered, but it was some sort of grilled chicken lunch plate that came with rice + orzo and 2 kinds of salad, and pita bread.For $9, it was a mother effing huge portion.The chicken was full of flavor and the salads I wasn&#39;t really feeling all too much although I loved the rice + orzo because I am a carb whore.I&#39;m going to have to come back again to try their gyros, so until then my review shall remain 3 stars.Unless of course, Leap Leap decides to visit me for lunch again and we grab a gyro.... *hint hint*

Doesn&#39;t happen often but I hate that feeling after you&#39;ve been looking forward to something delicious and it turns out to be less than average. Falafel was mediocre at best - dry, overstuffed with lettuce, menu says it comes with hummus but I didn&#39;t see/taste any. When I ordered coffee the old man seemed ticked that he would have to make some (so I switched to diet coke instead). Price was great but I regret the calories. Next time I&#39;ll go to Ananda Fuara around the corner.

Chicken kebab sandwich...very bland, thin. 4 pieces of chicken, some lettuce, and a bit of runny yogurt sauce. Not at all like, say, Truly Mediterranean. No complexity of flavor (barely flavor at all), extremely basic. The people who work there give new meaning to &#34;scowl.&#34;

Serving up something a bit different than your usual shawarmas, the King also offers freshly grilled chicken shish kebabs lavash wraps. Add in some greens, a dab of hummus, roll it up and place on the grill for a minute or so. Perfectly delicious.The King indeed.

Huge portions!!!I got myself the falafel. I was so surprised when I felt the to go bag. Each of their rolled sandwiches must weigh 3 pounds!The sandwich was a little dry, but I had some hummus in my fridge and that helped the problem. Other than that, it was super tasty and super filling.Not kidding about the size of these things! My bf had ordered two, but could only eat one. I could barely eat the one I had ordered.I would like to try their appetizer plate next!Great place for vegetarians... just ignore the weird meaty smell.

Ah, furlough days. State Building? Closed. Federal Building? Not a chance.So where exactly, then, does that leave us meandering for satisfaction during our City Hall lunch hour?Today&#39;s quest for quick-and-easy leads us to Gyro King.Even at 1 p.m., their walk-up counter is a bit busy -- though not as long of a line during the Noon hour -- but yet, the same three seemingly family-owned operators run the crowd to perfection.In less than five minutes, we&#39;ve ordered up the usual No. 27 (combo gyro), thought about some baklava (but refrained due to our expanding waistlines), and paid the guy with relative ease.One star for the wait time, another for the always clean tables and floors, and finally throw in two more stars for the delicious Mediterranean fare.We&#39;ll definitely be back next week, just like last week, and the week before...

Stumbled on this place after going to the Asian Art Museum. Was looking for something good and quick... definitely found it here. Looks like a bit of a hole in the wall from the outside, but it&#39;s clean and the food was great. Had the chicken kabab plate. Very tasty, everything seemed very fresh, and it was reasonably priced. Can&#39;t ask for too much more on a Saturday afternoon traipsing around museums.

I&#39;ve been living across the street now for a few months and I was in the mood for something different. So I asked the leasing agent at my apartment for some recommendations and that&#39;s where Gyro King steps in.I got the Lamb and Beef Gyro Platter not knowing what to expect.What I got was; amazing portions and delicious food.Delicious salad, delicious beef and lamb, delicious rice, delicious bread, delicious everything!It&#39;s definitely another hidden gem on Market Street!!!

This is the place to get your Falafel and Baklava fix in the Civic Center/TL area. I&#39;ve been coming here for years, my good friend Irv turned me on to this place and I have been coming back. Why? Cause it&#39;s consistently good and you can get a decent, fulfilling meal for right around $10.I&#39;m a creature of habit and always order the Falafel wrap. This is not your ordinary falafel in a Pita, they use another type of bread that is similar to a flour tortilla which they roll and then grill it just a bit to warm it but not enough to make the Houmos run. I just returned from Jerusalem as in Israel and saw plenty of stands selling Baklava and guess what? after each bite I said, &#34;It&#39;s not like Gyro King&#39;s&#34; wah!This is the best place by far for Baklava, it&#39;s made fresh, not bought in bulk from a factory in South City and passed off as their own, this is the real deal. This baklava looks pretty you almost don&#39;t want to eat it but then the first bite is crunchy on the outside and has some &#34;give&#34; in the center, the combination of sweet, spices, and nuts(walnut or pistachio) are perfect.Everytime I&#39;m flying in/out of SFO and take BART I pick up a meal to go.The owners are great, they are from Turkey and always have Turkish Satellite TV on which makes the place seem a bit more authentic.There&#39;s more than just Falafel, lots of grilled food and salads too.

The Gyro King on 25 Grove was highly recommended by a business colleague of mine.I arrived around 11:30 before the lunch time rush. The place was decent inside for a side street and you could totally miss it if you didn&#39;t know it was there. Once inside I ordered a Greek Salad, a side of Hummus and some bread. I then sat down and tried the Hummus and the salad, both were good and everything was great until the older gentleman cleaning the table next to me came by and I about threw up. Yes, he smelled like he hadn&#39;t taken a shower in a few months. Eating lunch off of one of the sleeping homeless outside, probably would&#39;ve been more pleasant. I got up and left my unfinished meal...I defiantly won&#39;t be going back!

I went here hankering for food desperately before seeing Wicked. YUCK, the gryo was just bad. The meat wasn&#39;t very good and there wasn&#39;t any good flavor in the sauces. I couldn&#39;t even finish it. The wrap itself was thin and tasteless.The only saving grace of this place was that the baklava was really good. Just the right combination of pastry and sweetness. I would go back for some those sweet deserts.

Update: Though I don&#39;t work at the law office near by anymore, I still miss they kabobs here and the large portions. I have since tried other kabob places but still prefer this one over the rest. I just wish it would be in a better area, like closer to Market instead of near hookers and strip joints where I have to pass by the homeless who hound you for money while conducting their &#34;business&#34; right in front of you. *eww* So minus a star for the location and minus another one for the awful smells!My half sister took me here one day while running errands. I really enjoyed the fact that this place gives you two kabob sticks as apposed to one for the same price. I had the chicken Shish which was excellent and that came with two different kinds of rice pilaf and a salad and of course the free pita bread they give you, all for about 9 bucks. I liked the flavor and the portion a whole lot better than Clement&#39;s &#34;Troya&#34; which now is under new owner ship and frankly sucks more than ever. I would recommend coming here and trying the food, it&#39;s probably not the best Turkish/middle Eastern food but it&#39;s definitely better than most and the portions are a lot bigger. Just be careful when you&#39;re in the area since it is partly in the Tenderloin.

I&#39;m giving this restaurant four stars because it&#39;s a solid, inexpensive lunch option in the Civic Center area. I eat here a couple of times a month. Standard menu fare includes falafel and beef, lamb, or chicken kababs or wraps. Vegetarians can make a meal out of the appetizer plate or the falafel (it comes with a yogurt sauce so vegans should ask for it w/o the sauce). I would agree with what some people have said about the falafel being a little dry, but you can ask for extra yogurt sauce or add hummus.The deli case has a good number of really great sides, such as dolmas (!!), tabouli, eggplant salad, bean salad, cucumber salad. They serve the sides with a really yummy, soft turkish bread. They also have meat breads like you would find in Turkey, as well as a large baklava selection.I have found the guys working the grill line to be totally accommodating, though you do have to slow down a little to work through the language barrier. They will totally understand you even if you are asking for strange things like 1/2 and 1/2 salads for the price of 1 salad. I believe this to be a family run operation, and find the men who work the register to be a little gruff seeming at first, but very kind too.If you are going in a group of 4-8, you should try for an early or late lunch, because the tables fill up. The ambiance is basically a loud lunch place, no frills. All-in-all, a solid option if you&#39;re in the area.

We stopped here after touring the Asian Art Museum today for lunch. My husband and the lamb and beef gyro, which he said, were pretty good. It looked more burrito like then what I was expecting, but the yogurt sauce wasn&#39;t over powering, the meat was done right, and the lettuce and cucumber inside were good.I had the special plate with chicken kabobs. There were 2 tasty kabobs with chicken and red pepper. The special came with a side of basmati rice, a side of red pepper cous cous, salad with cucumber and tomato, and bread. One of our friends had the hummus and enjoyed it quite a bit as well, they put some olive oil and spices on top of the hummus, which was kind of different from most places.The whole lunch set us back only $20. Pretty good for a lunch in the city.

After visiting a couple times, my tip would be to go for the meat platters, not the gyro wraps. The platter is huge, with fresh salad topped with delicious pickled cabbage, moist buttery rice, tasty tomato-y couscous, &amp; of course, a big serving of meat! Yes, the meat can be a little dry sometimes, but just throw on the yogurt sauce &amp; dig in! As for the wraps, I&#39;m not a fan. They can be dry &amp; I just really think that the rice &amp; couscous add more to the meal than the flat bread does.

Seriously, there is not even a single thing about this restaurant that I could mark as negative.The restaurant itself looks unspectacular, almost hidden in the Tenderloin area, but once you enter, you feel welcome immediately. The service is so friendly and accommodating and also very speedy!The portions are huge, fresh, delicious and authentic! And the best is that all this is offered to you for a fantastic price!If you like self-made, tasty food in an almost familial atmosphere, have a look at the Gyro King!

Came here unexpectedly. Didn&#39;t know what to expect but I REALLY enjoyed the baklava. It was quite tasty, and one of the best I&#39;ve ever devoured in my mouth. Mmmmm. I also had a falafel. It was good as well, but I definitely enjoyed the baklava more. I&#39;m a baklava fanatic and it was worth the $2.50. Service was a-ok, not quite friendly, a bit rude. I ate outside around 6pm, and there were some crazies that did enjoy to converse with me in a ridiculous manner. Eat inside! Avoid the ridiculousness.I&#39;m definitely not going to go here again for the food if I&#39;m ever around the area. MAYBE, just for the baklava, but that&#39;s pretty much it. My dine-in was a good experience, now time to move on and try new things. (:

Great location near SF Civic Center steps away from BART. I meet with a lot of people, i.e clients and I tend to know a lot of cool meeting spots around the bay area. This is a new spot with really good food at affordable prices that make this a fun, nice and friendly eatery. I had the Chicken Kebab gyro which was very filling, easy on the pocketbook and made meeting with a few clients much much easier.Plus the service was extremely fast, friendly and the place was very clean. I will go back again for sure!

Very busy the night we went. But were there for a concert so I imagine some of the crowd was on the same mission we were. The service was ok, not super friendly at all but also could be a result of how busy they were. The food was ok but nothing to write home about. I love greek food but I&#39;ve definitely had better. Would only try it again if it I was in the same situation (only place I could find within walking distance of a venue I needed to go to in a short amount of time).

Not bad for cheap Meditteranean eats after/before a museum or Civic Center romp. It&#39;s not quite like sitting out on a patio at a Greek taverna overlooking the sea on Santorini, however, the menu is pretty authentic and minimal as far as ingredients go. The best Meditteranean food is simple and yummy. The inside ain&#39;t nothing fancy (read - not a sexy date place) but again, perfect for a quick could-be healthy meal when in the area. The owners are super nice. Opa!

Feed me Seymour!Because I do all my grocery shopping at Rainbow Grocery, which consists of almost all organic fare and carries no meat, I am known for some wild deviations when it comes to foraging beyond the home. For example, I love delis. And I love Gyro King!Details:- mouth-watering lamb- incredibly spiced and seasoned eggplant- fluffy warm ethic-y bread that complements the animal grease impeccably- Very masculine, gruff, Greek men! When you live in the Castro, this is not a trivial indulgence.I gave just 4 stars NOT due to the utter lack of ambiance (think cafeteria, but for me totally ok since I take it out and frankly that adds to the masculine aura), but rather to the price point: I paid $7 for 2 skewers of lamb and $4 for a side of eggplant.But overall: simply too endearing and savory not to endorse!

Decided to pop in here before seeing a concert; it ended up being the worst spontaneous decision I&#39;ve made in a very long time. So many problems...let me count the ways:1. They were out of gyros at 8pm. This place is called &#34;Gyro King&#34;.2. A guy was mopping behind the counter the entire time we were there, which looked totally gross while they were preparing food.3. My boyfriend got served his food right away (chicken kabob since there was no gyro option). My food (a falafel wrap) took 30 minutes to make. Apparently they were also out of falafel and had to make more.4. I was very clear to the staff that I was allergic to dairy and could not eat the cucumber yogurt sauce. I said to put hummus only. When I finally got my food 30 minutes later and bit into it, I got a mouthful of dairy. Great.5. So I ask them to remake my wrap with no yogurt sauce. 5 minutes later, I get a new wrap. This time I check it at the counter. IT STILL HAS DAIRY in it. I am amazed. Perhaps the cook is developmentally delayed in some way.6. Finally, I go to the manager and explain the issue. He yells, &#34;Hummus only!&#34; to the cook. The next wrap I receive has hummus and falafel. This time, though, he left out all of the salad that makes it a wrap.7. Exasperated, I ask for salad on the side. They dump some salad on my plate. My boyfriend has been done with his food for ages and we have now missed the opening band which was the band I really wanted to see.I gulp down most of the wrap, which after all that drama was meh at best. We both leave upset. I will never go back there; I will never recommend it to anyone. FIRED.

My favorite holiday in terms of food is Greek Easter. The meal consists of lamb, Greek salad and rice. I usually only have it once a year though. Well, The Turkish owner of Gyro King may disagree, but their lamb platter is very similar, and really, really delicious. They also have great gyros. I accidentally got a chicken gyro once. Anyone who knows me, knows I&#39;m not into ordering chicken anything out, have way too much at home. However, this gyro was really tasty. The owner was nice to me, but that may have been because of my chair, and my need for a little more help.Definitely a must go to, if you like gyros or lamb.

Man do I love me some gyro!With that said, I stumbled upon this place as I was headed towards the civic center BART.The lamb gyro I ordered was damn good. It was served nice and warm and the ingredients tasted fresh.I particularly liked that bread was toasted on the grill and very tasty.Only pain was the cashier (who I think is also the owner). He was chatting with some guys at a table for 3-4 min while I waited at the counter. The chef ended up taking my order and he was a really friendly guy. When it came time to pay, the other guy made his way over to the register and was very friendly so I didn&#39;t hold the wait time against him.

DAMN IT!Besides the pie, I had the chicken kebabs platter with the rice, couscous and salad. It was good, definitely not the best I&#39;ve had. The couscous and rice were flavorful and not dry at all, but the salad wasn&#39;t fresh and the lettuce was kind of wilting. It was a lot of food, I had plenty leftover. Good place for lunch.

Note: this review is based on one menu item only---the saliva inducing, mouth satisfying, smile creating lamb and beef platter. The service is fast and friendly, and the foods are displayed openly so you can see what you&#39;re ordering.Parking is not the greatest, the neighborhood is riddled with crackheads, felons, and feces-stained weirdos, but other than that I&#39;ll stop by this diamond in the rough for that lamb and beef platter (12 bucks cash covers it).Succulent meat, fluffy rice, home-cooked flavors and aromas have enslaved me to this dish. I skip the pita and substitute with more rice. It&#39;ll serve 2 people just fine.So grab 12 bucks, a MUNI pass, pepper spray and some anti bacteria wipes and have yourself an adventure!

I came here before seeing Wicked at the Orpheum Theatre. It was my second time having greek in one day so I kept my plate simple and went for the Greek Chicken Salad. Everything was cooked fresh so as expected it took a little longer than usual to get our order, but it was worth the wait! The plentiful amount of grilled and seasoned chicken was so good! The salad was ginormous so I rolled out of this place stuffed to the brim because I couldn&#39;t leave one bite remaining on my big plate. I can&#39;t wait to try out some of their other dishes, hopefully they are as good as the salad is.

The location is just a hop across the SF main library where if you sat on the best seat of the house, a full view to the hurried lives of books and their readers can be as entertaining as the windmill driven door fanning the imagination to what book it was, the memories gathered from it and the magical effect it had unleashed at that moment of the day. This place makes me think about these books, of far away places I dream of visiting one day-- Byzantium.The restaurant itself is simple without undue fuss or decors neither does it try to cover its just simplicity. There is one exception, an arresting panoramic view of the Bosphorus bridge-- a similar one appears just across our bay. It possesses you like some golden fleece now framed as Aries in the night sky, or the stolen Helen of Troy with all its enchanting ruminations where legends meet historical revolutions to seize its famous straits from the Dardanelles to the Bosphorus...So every time I find myself here- one simple pie entertains in the same manner weaving stories that entails the ancestral origin of what we call the pizza- here in Turkish called &#34;pide.&#34; A buttery dough baked like a flat bread topped with a tomato base sauce with hints of bechamel, cloves with stew flavors to whet any appetite. Perhaps this delicious snack was even feasted by the very same Emperors who ruled the land and the shepherds who visited here throughout history speaking of its mythological grandeur. This land where once groves of dates and pistachio trees roamed wildly and where honey from lavender and wild roses drizzled to silken perfection on sweet baklava treats. It is an afternoon best enjoyed with a book, a friend or marveling at the food served here. I highly recommend the Homeric gyro sure to satisfy any gustatory voyage as well and the special plates complete with an enriched persil coucous salad and the cucumber tomato salad laced in the most vibrant Mediterranean vinegar and olive oil concoction.PS- If you wish to make pide pie from scratch, you must first create the Universe :-)Afiyet olsun!

I&#39;ve lived within a few blocks of this place for almost a year, and just went in there the other day.I had the Lamb Shish Kebab platter: *generous* portions, and a low, low price. Very good. Overheard someone say &#34;the remodel looks great&#34;., so guess they did some of that.I now have another place in the hood to keep me nourished.

my best friend and i came here because the restaurant we wanted to go to was closed (bummer) and this random homeless girl sitting outside said this place was good. seriously.anyway, of course we go, because we had to snag some food before seeing wicked (loved it by the way). i was suprised by how good it was! it was really cheap too. like 5 bucks for a falafel, and it was huge! my friend got the chicken pie i think- i dont eat meat but she said it was good. she also got a salad which was either cous cous or quinoa. we split the hummus and pita appetizer. i think they make the pita themselves because it was soft and warm and delicious.the guys who work here arent super friendly but whatever, they&#39;re nice enough. go here if youre in civic center and need food! at least once. you wont regret

Are they the king? They&#39;re certainly the closest to City Hall/Civic Center. Gavin&#39;s kind of a king-type. Why not?Falafel is crispy, tasty and not too mealy. Feta pie is a little spongy. Haven&#39;t had any meat here, but for a quick veggie meal for under $6, downtown and in less that 10 minutes, there&#39;s not much that can beat it.

One thing about the Tenderloin is you&#39;re never lacking in ethnic food choices. Gyro King is a perfect example. They serve up delicious shish kebabs, warm and yummy gyros, and great specials every day. And $10 goes a long way at this place. Unless you&#39;re a huge eater or have a bottomless pit for a stomach, you may want to share your Mediterranean feast with a coworker. I can barely finish half of what they give me. The combos come with lots of meat, two types of rice, a salad and bread. It can a bit intimidating. So unless your office has a couch to take an afternoon snooze on, you may want to grab a coffee on your way back.

Pretty good falafel - kinda on the salty side. Excellent chicken shawarma plate. Great spicy sauce. I heart their homemade bread.Best to go right after your romp in the library. Bring you best reads with you while you eat. It&#39;s certainly better than Burger King.

Pretty good falafel here. I didn&#39;t expect such a convivial dining area in these parts. I could actually enjoy a meal here if I didn&#39;t get it to go. They have a lot of variety, but alas, no french fries. Luckily, Burger King was right around the corner to pickup some fried potatoes to accompany my falafel.

We used to come here all the time until we found yummier &#34;as close to a New York gyro cart you&#39;re gonna get&#34; gyros. Their lamb and beef gyro wraps (almost $6) weren&#39;t really that good and their falafels were ok. We did not return because we loved the food, we returned because it was the only place we knew of that had decent gyros. I always eye the platters people order secretly wishing to have that instead of what we ordered but unwilling to fork over the $10. The guy who cuts the meat is always really friendly unlike the other guy who usually takes the order who looks impatient, sour, and indifferent. I think they both have some family partnership for the restaurant. I have not returned to Gyro King since discovering other gyro shops.

DAMN!!!! The food here was HHHEEELLLAAA good, we (me and the fellas) had the shish kabob mix and it was damn good. Seriously, we came here on and couldnt decide what to order so we went for the kabob mix (chicken/lamb/beef) and I am very happy we did. Everything from the salad to the rice to the hoummous to the kababs was &#34;on point!&#34; Price was perfect and staff was ultra cool food was good sized portions. Very satisfying and fulfilling....I PROMISE TO COME BACK AS OFTEN AS POSSIBLE AND RECOMMEND OTHERS TO DINE HERE TOO!!!

Wow, I guess I&#39;m one of the few people who think that the gyro from Gyro King are completely vile.I stopped in, not too late, and got a gyro.... I figured, I love gyro&#39;s, they&#39;re the gyro king, why not? It tasted like they cooked the lamb a week before, only to reheat it on a flat top swimming in the most disgusting grease I ever saw or tasted in my life. Not only was the meat burned, but the bread tasted liked burned tortilla!! I&#39;m used to somewhat fluffy pita... I guess traditionally its only a tortilla.. ?All the other customers looked happy, not one was eating a gyro. So the lesson to learn: Don&#39;t order Gyro from the Gyro King!If you want a killer Gyro, try Ayola!! If you want to be killed by a gyro, stick with the King.

This place is great, it reminds me of the kebab shops in the Beyoglu of Istanbul. All you need to complete the picture are a bunch of old men sitting around smoking and drinking tea.I have had most everything on the menu but I would recommend sticking to the basics, this is a popular place so the food is fresh but it can be a challenge getting a seat around lunch time.

I&#39;ve had a cranky past few days in SF. Imagine my disappointment when I go to what *used* to be my favorite Middle Eastern restaurant in SF and realize the food now sucks. Maybe it&#39;s the Latino guy making my food. Maybe it was the soggy and flavorless baklavah. Whatever it was, my gyro was downright un-edible. It&#39;s pretty sad when I&#39;m a better cook than *the* cook ya know what I mean?

Coming to this place was an accident. Seriously. I walked in hoping to use their restroom, but as I was looking around, I noticed that the food looked all kinds of yummy. So I went up to the guy behind the counter, and in my awkward weirdness, I asked to order the burrito look-alike wrap with meat inside. The guy was confused and gave me this look, but then he said okay. I spent six bucks on a LAMB AND BEEF GYRO, I&#39;m glad he told me what I ordered because I had no idea. I went to the Civic Center Plaza to sit on the grass and enjoy my gyro with my friends. It was surprisingly good since I&#39;ve never had mediterranean food before. I like the refreshing and cool sauce that&#39;s in the gyro. They give you a decent amount of meat and the gyro itself is worth the money considering it wasn&#39;t small in size. Eating at this place makes me want to explore other mediterranean restaurants.

I eat here about three times a week for lunch. The wraps are AWESOME. I can only recommend the chicken and the falafel wraps. The falafel comes with hummus. Also the gyro king salad (chicken salad) is good; they hook it up with the chicken. You can get a great meal for under $10. I&#39;ve had their dolmas and I can&#39;t say that I&#39;m a fan (they were kind of dry, needed more olive oil). Other than that, it&#39;s pretty much delicious :)

I would have walked right past this generic-looking gryo hut with a generic-sounding name if not for the positive Yelp reviews, and I wish I had. I was intrigued by the toasted flat-bread wrapping my falafel, but my meal quickly reminded me how essential pita is to a falafel wrap. The falafel was fine, but nothing special. The positive reviews gave me an excuse to try the baklava; I agree it was better than the rest of the meal, but not good enough to make me go back to Gyro King.

I tried this place because I needed a new place for lunch. Their was a huge line out the door so I thought if that many people are going it must be good right? Well the logic might have been decent but I failed to realize their was a huge convention in town. This was the overflow crowd.Nonetheless I was as happy as could be. I&#39;ve been back many times and have passed it on to many a friend.The food is made when you order it, as opposed to the food sitting in a bin for two hours, and they give you a good amount of food. They are super friendly as well.Just as an aside. The guys who run the place are from Turkey. Some people may be expecting Greek food because of the name but it&#39;s all similar northern medaterranean food. Give it a shot.

If you are looking for something different, they have gyro pie which works great for lunchies as well.I used to avoid this place at lunch time. But they did a remodel and now there is soooo much more room inside.If you want to stay away from coffee, ask for some tea while you are waiting for your food.

Came her during my lunch break from jury duty. This place was packed and I couldn&#39;t find anywhere to sit and I only had an hour. By the time I ordered, I saw a spot at the window with a stool empty. I literally had to fight with someone to grab that seat! I was angry/happy at the same time because I got to sit and &#34;enjoy&#34; my food. I ordered the lamb/beef gyro on lavash. It didn&#39;t take long for my me to get my order but it was a really messy wrap. I took a bite into it and I tasted nothing but the wrap. I gave it some time and thought the filling was coming up.. but I was wrong.. It literally had like 2 pieces of lamb/beef in there and lots of cucumber, tomato, onion, and sauce. If I wanted to go vegan for the day, I would of ordered a vegan wrap or something. I was so pissed of because I waited in line for it, and had to fight to get a spot to sit in.I left hungry and was really disappointed at this place.

Despite its moniker, the gyros here was not that great. My fiance got the chicken, lamb gyro and it was very bland. I would definitely recommend the chicken kebab plate though. the chicken was succulent and marinated just right. the rice was tasty too. they do give pretty big portions. the prices were reasonable. i wouldn&#39;t go out of my way to go back, but if i ended up here, i would stick with the kebab plate. as for the ambience, it was very minimal. very fast-foody. not the kind of place to take a date. if i could give a half star, i&#39;d give it a 2.5

This is probably one of my favorite places to get a fast, good meal. I have been dining at Gyro King for years and have never been disappointed. It is located in semi hidden but convenient location across from the library. Recently the place has had a nice upgrade with expanded seating areas, a splash of paint, funky plates on the wall, but the food remains the same, very good.Very nice family owned business. The owner only looks like he will cut off your legs and put them on the rotisserie, he is really a nice guy who runs a &#34;tight ship&#34;. Very attentive, good service.I am not really a &#34;hoofed animal&#34; eater but every blue moon I will indulge in a lamb gyro...oh so good! The chicken gyro is just the right size and if you add a diet Snapple...walla...the perfect &#34;on the go&#34; or &#34;oh my god I am so late but I would like something good to eat before&#34; meal...They also have a great verity of Turkish delicacies.Go...it is good!

I really like this place. It&#39;s very accessible from BART and MUNI (thank god) and it&#39;s pretty cheap. I&#39;ve seen some gyro and other Greek places and this one is definitely the best priced. Got the Lamb and Beef gyro which was awesome. The only thing that was bad was that it was messy to eat, which is probably no fault of their own, and when I say probably I mean it was entirely my fault.The people who work there are nice but a little intimidating. I was getting a to-go order expect the guy who looks like Uncle Leo from Seinfeld handed me a plate which totally confused me. I asked the lady at the register what to do and she looked at me like I was crazy...hmm. But yeah. They&#39;re good

When I lived in San Ramon, I would walk by this place on my way to work in Hayes Valley/Civic Center from the BART station a gazillion times. Finally tried it a few months ago with a friend before a performance. The staff is really nice and this is a convenient place to grab a quick and inexpensive meal before going to the library or Orpheum Theater. While the gyro wrap was pretty good, it was downright messy. The dressing/sauce was all over the place, and it seemed like the ingredients were stuffed into a wrap that couldn&#39;t hold it. I&#39;m a big fan of smaller portions and I dislike it when my food is annoyingly huge. Maybe next time I&#39;ll try their other dishes and desserts.Outdoor seating is not that great considering the somewhat shady area, but they have bar-like seating at the window. Tables are crowded next to each other and it&#39;s not easy relaxing in your seat. Since there aren&#39;t many inexpensive food options in the Civic Center area, I would recommend this place. If you are headed towards Hayes Valley, go ahead and try Hayes and Kebab - I like their gyro wraps much better, the atmosphere is less cafeteria-like, and their prices are comparable.

Decent prices, maybe a slight too high considering the atmosphere of the place, a little dingy with the lighting, and a couple sparse nice paintings. They made no effort to hide the soda machines which line the back wall which shows that they care more about selling soda then their overall appeal. However... they do have truly authentic Eastern food, olive oils, and herbs and garlic. Lamb off the rotisserie. My wife grew up overseas. It&#39;s the first time we came across &#34;Dolma&#34; in a restaurant in the USA. I haven&#39;t tried their Gyro&#39;s yet, we&#39;ll see if they are &#34;king&#34;. I am a loyal Greek food enthusiast, and as far as I know... chicken souvlaki with tzatziki and feta is king, so unless I see a Gyro like that... I&#39;m afraid it will just be false advertising.

Yur durn tootin this place is awesome. Gyro was great. Excellent lamb, although I always feel a little guilty eating lamb. The cabbage salad they had was also quite good.Order at counter, they bring to your table. They were very friendly when we were there even though the place was crazy packed.This place is a definite return. And being so close to bart, its super convenient. Definitely beats the burger king 100 feet away.

If you want great, unassuming Mediterranean food, this is the place to go. Yeah, yeah. Lamb...good, chicken...good...whatever...just please order the BABA GANOUSH! If you come here to order one thing, order this. The sweet, smoky blend of pureed eggplants is sublime. Smear it on the bread, the meats, the dolma or your significant other.The only thing I don&#39;t like is that the loonies from the library hang out in front more than is comfortable. I don&#39; think they come in, but it&#39;s really daunting when you need to go into the restaurant. That&#39;s hardly the Gyro King&#39;s fault though, is it?4 stars for the food and 1 star for the owner, who is great, and looks like a Mediterranean Brian Cox.

This place sucks.My friend and I went in and asked for falafels, knowing that falafel&#39;s are by their very nature vegetarian, because, well, we&#39;re vegetarian. So they give us our falafels, we start eating them, and I decide to look a little closer about halfway through the sandwich. There, staring back at me, are a couple of hunks of some white, fleshy stuff.We take the sandwich up to the counter, explain that this looks like chicken in my vegetarian sandwich, and the guy goes, no, that&#39;s a falafel. After a little back and forth, he admits that some chicken was mixed into the salad. Oops. There was no apology, nothing.We kindly ask for our money back, thoroughly disgusted, and the guy friggin swears at us! He&#39;s like, &#34;Well did you eat it?&#34; and I&#34;m like, &#34;Well, yeah, until I saw that there was chicken in it. Now I don&#39;t want to, I can&#39;t eat it.&#34;

I went there at 10:30 AM for breakfast on Saturday. Nobody was there yet and all food were not there yet, either. So, I ordered whatever they had at that time, they were soup and chicken pie. The bread came with the soup was still hot and delicious. (Freshly-baked bread is nice always!) Chicken pie was good too. I will try the Gyro and Kabab next time for sure. Also, the girls working there were pretty and kind.

I am not kidding when I say that i fully believe this to be in the stinkiest area of San Francisco. I dread coming up from the Civic Center stop because I feel like I will reek of that dried bum sweat/old piss stench. It&#39;s so hard to imagine glossy Gavin walking through here and avoiding the smell of pus.I&#39;ve gotten far too graphic to arouse any appetites, and for that I am sorry. Because the Gyro Nazi is silly good; it&#39;s the best hummus, falafel, gyros, and oh, the salads are fresh and huge and delicious. You kind of have to to get in a confrontation to order your food and then get your food, but it&#39;s no big deal. Just stand your ground.

While the prices weren&#39;t too bad mainly $6.50 for a sandwich, it lacked flavor need more meat less lettuce and maybe even some more veggies and sauce. They would probably do better with their gyros in a pita like bread like most other places. I am sure they have some other nice dishes from what I seen in the pictures had more balance. I do have to say its a clean place and the staff was really friendly and that usually goes a long way with me but, I can only see myself eating here if I just happen to be in the area and was craving Mediterranean. Nothing to go out of your way for!

This place is really cheap and really good. I look forward to visiting San Francisco for places like this. We had the Baba Ganoush, a red lentil soup that I can&#39;t recall the name of and a grilled lamb kabob in a wrap. The Baba Ganoush was great, it didn&#39;t even taste like eggplant, I hate eggplant, and it came with a tasty homemade bread. The lentil soup was also awesome, thick and great flavor. The lamb kabob wrap was amazing, (mostly) green lettuce, cucumber, tomatoes, the lamb was rich, tender, smokey and full of flavor. All for under $20, which, of course, has a big impact on my impression. Great food for a great price, I would definitely go back. And it was fast and friendly, served by who I am assume is the owner.

A wonder dive of good food with excellent portions and enough chaos to keep you watchful.My favorite dish is the ground lamb kabob with sides. They also serve an amazing soup and the most delicioius of flatbreads. An order of soup and bread in itself is worh the visit. All their salads look delicious and whenever I go I&#39;m always checking out what everyone else has ordered.The drawbacks include the lack of workers who function well in English and the confusing menu with lack of any signage on the food. I&#39;ve discovered that pointing at things is the best way to communicate what I&#39;d like to have. They also don&#39;t have good coffee to go with the desserts, so, unfortunately, the desserts become an afterthought. But they give you a large portion of baklavah (2 pieces) with an order.

I&#39;m giving it many stars...I was happy as can be. The breads coming right out of the oven, feta pizzas, spinach pizzas smelled so so good. I got the appetizer combo with baba, hummous, tabbouli, an eggplant salad (smokey goodness), a minced marinated veggie salad (more deliciousness) a surprisingly good dolma (don&#39;t normally go for those, so was pleased) and a lovely little white bean salad. OH, and some couscous salad, all with two fluffy little loaves of fresh bread for sopping up the goodness.I also got the beef and lamb combo plate which was lots of tasty meat with rice and couscous with a salad that didn&#39;t suck and some yummy dressing. I&#39;ve eaten a fair bit of Turkish street food in Germany and this was just as good as the Doner Kebap places I&#39;ve eaten at there. I can&#39;t wait to go back. OH, and they give you lots of food and it&#39;s cheap and they treat you like they just don&#39;t care, so it feels REALLY German/ Turkish. Yay.

Decent food at reasonable prices at this well-located meet-up stop right outside of the Civic Center BART station. Veggie sampler combo plate is way more than enough food for one person, super tasty &#34;bread&#34; to go with the hummus and dips, too. Outdoor seating is clean and pleasant enough. The falafel wrap here was a little dry when I had it... chicken kebab was good though!This seems like it&#39;d be a good lunch stop if you&#39;re spending a day at the Main Library, whose cafe is okay but somewhat dark and w/ a somewhat limited menu.

Here I thought I&#39;d discovered something, and yet, voila! 109 reviews already! I even asked the cashier/owner whether they&#39;d been there long. I don&#39;t walk down Grove that often, but I have at least half a dozen times and have never seen this place open.I&#39;m glad they were open this time. My sister and I were headed for the Herbst Theatre for a Magnetic Fields concert, when her stomach started demanding food. I honestly don&#39;t know where any of the good places to eat in the city are. Well, correction, I know of one now. We popped in to Gyro King on the premise that we would only stay to eat if they had a bathroom (her bladder was also demanding something). A big plus for the food is that it is not dried out. I&#39;ve had some Mediterranean food before that tastes a dry and old. It is a little oily, but sometimes that&#39;s a good thing, and even the bread for our baba-ganoush was soft and fresh. The bab-ganoush itself was mildly citrusy and had a fresh garden-party-in-your-mouth flavor. The dolmas were moist and the baklava was too, but still so crispy and flaky, not mushy at all. The only thing I wasn&#39;t so keen on, though it was still really good, was the spanikopita. It was sort of more like onionkopita cause man there were plenty of big chunks of onion. So if you like onions, try the onionkopita, I mean, the spanikopita.I wish I&#39;d discovered you sooner, Gyro King.

I am giving this four stars because it is worthy of me going back to try another dish at least once.I ordered the lamb &amp; beef gyro platter which comes with rice and salad. I was a little disappointed that upon my ordering neither of the two men behind the counter made a move to make my dish. This lasted a few minutes until the cook came out of the back to make it. The service was painfully slow, taking longer to make and prepare the dish than it did to eat. But it was good. Not an actual gyro at all though so that&#39;s deceiving. It was essentially a deconstructed???? gyro at best.It was tasty and worthy of going back.

truth be told, i&#39;ve never had a gyro sandwich here.however, the numerous times i&#39;ve been to gyro king, i&#39;ve eaten so many of their kebab plates, you&#39;d think i&#39;d be sprouting little kebabs from my head.my go-to&#39;s are definitely the kofte, iskender and adana kebabs. each are succulent and heavy with the middle eastern spices. the plates are accompanied with some golden pilaf, cucumber/tomato salad, and sesame flatbread.i always get some baba ghanoush to go because it&#39;s lemon-garlic ratio is superb. close to how my armenian friend&#39;s father makes at home (i know this is sacrilege, mentioning armenia and turkey in the same breadth considering the genocide and all, but i swear the baba ghanoush is similar!!!!). and, if you&#39;ve never had manti before, this is a good place to try it. they&#39;re little dough balls stuffed with seasoned ground beef and topped with a garlic yogurt sauce.oh almighty buddha, i know eating animals won&#39;t get me to the next level, but i&#39;m salivating as i write this....the chicken and lamb shishes are pretty tender as they come straight off the grill and onto your plate. the old men sitting around are all related and watch turkish telly 24-7 at this small cafeteria-style restaurant so don&#39;t expect a fancy meal with four star service. there&#39;s a counter, you order, you sit (sometimes) and eat really tasty food. that&#39;s all.

This place is really pretty good. Fast, convenient, and with good gyro wraps. Now it&#39;s hard to compare their gyros with the type of stuff you get in Europe. It&#39;s just not the same, and you&#39;ll have to accept that. However, this is one of the better wraps I&#39;ve had in SF and is comparable to what you can get at Taste of the Mediteranean on 16th. I haven&#39;t been here that much but I&#39;m going to come here more often. Hard to beat a good 5$ meal.

The gyros here are rather blah. The beef and lamb meat served up here is not of the gyro meat loaf variety. Instead it is sliced up off a layered pieces of the meat. While this would seem to produce a great tasting gyro, the meat is dry and not seasoned very well.The place is frenetic during lunch. You can often get a good show of the guys arguing back behind the counter. So lunch and show for under 7 bucks! And who said SF was expensive?

Since returning from Paris I&#39;ve been in desperate search of Grec with Frites, and despite my best attempts I&#39;ve yet to find a place that compares to the flavors I experienced while abroad. In that search I managed to find my way to the Gyro King. I attend school near the public library, so finding this little treasure is quite helpful to my wallet and my body. I purchased a lamb and beef gyro and found it quite scrumptious! the beef was a little dry for my taste, and there were too many cucumbers but those things aside the gyro was good for the price, though I can&#39;t say it&#39;s my favorite gyro place in the city I can say that it&#39;s now one of my regular stops. I&#39;m very anxious to try out the kebabs next time I go in.

Not impressed. Tried beef, lamb and chicken, all were dried out and tasteless. The gyro fell to pieces the second I opened the wrapper. Bread was so stale it could have been used as a doorstop. Salad ingredients were decent but the dressing was greasy and practically flavorless. To be honest, the only thing I really enjoyed here was the diet 7Up. I may give it another shot someday in the not too distant future but I&#39;m not going out of my way. Barely two stars.

Gyro King is great for a one thing: Gyros -- they are delicious and a good value. The Weekly Lunch Specials (Salman, Stuffed Peppers, etc., on rotation) are also delicious, but overpriced -- we&#39;re talking $10+. The sides - Eggplant, Hummus, Tabbouli, and the hot Bulgar are all great, but even more so overpriced -- $4.25 -- for an outrageously small plate. I do generally love the food here, but am boycotting this place for it&#39;s zealous overpricing none-the-less.

In the land of gyros, Gyro King most definitely does not reign supreme. I had the beef/lamb version. The meat was sort of dry and lacking in that trademark gyro flavor. I think the big mistake here is including beef in the mix. Also, they only put in a smidge of tahini, which wasn&#39;t nearly enough. Maybe if it had a dollop more, it would have somehow made up for the mediocre taste. In any case, I&#39;ve had better gyros at mall food courts.

Since the remodel about a year ago, the atmosphere has improved markedly. The food hasn&#39;t changed a bit, and that is a good thing! The #29 and #30 gyro plates (lamb and chicken, respectively) are can&#39;t-miss bets for a hearty and healthy lunch. The yogurt sauce is absolutely perfect, the rice is flavorful and the meat is always tender and delicious. If you are in the vicinity of Civic Center, it is always tempting to dine at the Asian Art museum. But if you want something a little more casual and always satisfying, Gyro King rules!

The first time I ate here was awhile back, right before I saw Wicked at the Orpheum (across the street). Otherwise, I ordinarily wouldn&#39;t be wondering around that area looking for a place to eat. I think I ordered the lamb and beef gyro and it was pretty good... good enough to make me come back for more. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s just me, but decent Mediterranean restaurants are hard to find in the city. Actually, this isn&#39;t so much a restaurant, but more of a casual dining spot. There really isn&#39;t any table service provided, but that&#39;s fine. Recently, I went back and ordered the lamb shish kebab. I love the TV dinner style thing they have going on, where they give you a bunch of sides (which are all good by the way) with your meal.

This was a really cool place. As a Turkish person, I had no idea they had yummy Turkish food. If you want to real ethnic experience, ask for the Gyro Wrap &#34;Turkish Style&#34; or you can call it &#34;Doner Durum&#34; if you want to impress the people there. It&#39;s basically Gyro meat with greens, onion, tomato and spicy sauce (And french fries if you want it Istanbul Style). The baklava is pretty good and the fries are very good.

Only had a lamb/beef gyro sandwich, but the meet was dry and the taste was blah, with the wrap partially burnt. I would not be tempted to waste money here again unless I was quite desperate.

this is where you go if you want a gyro and someone to hate you while you eat it. it&#39;s totally worth your trip to eat here, the gyro plate is the best and it&#39;s a ton of food. it&#39;s for sure the best in the city.I&#39;m not sure why they don&#39;t like anyone that walks in the door but its too good to stop going. my friends and i know it as the &#34;gyro nazi&#34; , but trust me it&#39;s uber good.

The food here is middle of the road at best. The good thing is that the portions are generous. If you are hungry near the library then check it out, but don&#39;t bring a date.
