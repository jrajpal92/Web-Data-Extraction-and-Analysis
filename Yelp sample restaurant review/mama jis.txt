Their Chongqing chicken left more to be desired. The meat was too dry and while the dish is meant to be crispy, it was overly so to the point where it hurt to eat.EDIT: I originally gave this place 3 stars based on the food however due to the horrible customer service we had, I reduced my rating to one. The phone was ringing right by my ear the whole time with no one to attend to it. The staff was poorly managed so that we spent more time waiting for our check than eating. With better management, this could be a decent place to go to but right now, it&#39;s chaotic.

At 1pm on a Tuesday I had no trouble getting seated. This is a very clean space with curious art on its walls. My lunch server was helpful with the menu, never let my water run out and checked up on me more than once, thank you Esthe..By myself I tried their savory Shrimp stuffed bell pepper. I enjoyed how the bell pepper still had some crispness to it but it was all drowning in too much sauce; Ill have that on the side next time..I dont know what the standard for Pan fried turnip cake is but this was one of the best I&#39;ve had. Not too salty, had a lightly fried exterior with an awesome fluffy textured interior, yummy..I tried but ended up taking home the Chicken wonton soup. The chicken broth was tasty, not too salty nor oily. It was loaded with bok choy, onion and many dumplings. The dumplings were well seasoned yet I thought just a bit too light with the chicken filling. Note: there were no chicken pieces in the soup broth the only chicken here was in the dumplings..Its nice to find dim sum in the Castro. I&#39;m looking forward to tying more dishes here. &#34;I&#39;ll be Back&#34;

Surprisingly tasty dim sum, if a bit on the pricier side. Apparently, we weren&#39;t the only ones to know of this place, because the wait on Sunday for lunch was about an hour! We ended up ordering a wide assortment, and I will say that pretty much everything was spot on.Of note were: shu mai (plump, moist, chock full of shrimp and shiitake mushrooms and pork goodness), shrimp dumplings with pea shoots (large in size), fried shrimp balls (these were the smallest I have ever seen, but fried perfectly and not oily at all!), garlic and ginger sauteed gai lan (tender and perfectly cooked, with a nicely light ginger sauce), haw gow (tasty with a lot of shrimp filling), beef chow fun (really good and not too salty or oily which often happens).I did not try the chive and shrimp dumplings or the xiao long bao, since I was stuffed, but my friends had no complaints. Nor did I try the dessert custard buns with condensed milk and egg, but they were appropriately oozy and hot upon arrival.The only dishes I didn&#39;t think were up to snuff given the price were the shrimp in rice noodles with the soy sauce, because the rice noodles were SO mushy and fell apart at the touch. I also thought that the vegetarian egg rolls, while better than most, were still a bit boring. I wish that they would try for the Shanghai style egg rolls which have a much tastier filling, but I do understand that they are a restaurant that specializes in Szechuan-style cuisine.Service was speedy and responsive, especially for a Chinese restaurant. I think it&#39;s pretty obvious that this is a family run establishment, as the serving staff was not formal at all. It helped that we could speak Mandarin. I would not hesitate to return to try some of the other dishes.Another vote in their favor in terms of authenticity? There were actually Chinese people waiting in line amongst the hipster SF crowd that you normally see when there is a wait outside a restaurant.

I basically grew up eating dim sum, about half my diet was probably shrimp dumplings and shrimp rice rolls, and I&#39;m happy to say that this place serves dim sum that&#39;s just as good as any hole-in-the-wall shop in Chinatown or Sunset!We came early afternoon on a Saturday and there was a huge line of people waiting. Took about 30 minutes but after we were seated, the food came out pretty fast!While the prices are definitely a lot higher than what I&#39;m used to (almost $5 for 3 shrimp dumplings?!), the dim sum was sooooooo good. Everything was so authentic, and so fresh it tasted like it was all freshly made :)Here&#39;s what we ordered:Shrimp dumplings: Must get!! These are top tier dumplings and I&#39;ve definitely sampled a good number of these in SFShrimp dumplings with pea sprouts: I saw on Yelp that these were good so instead of getting two orders of shrimp dumplings, we got one of these instead but definitely not as tasty as the normal shrimp dumplings. Would just stick to the shrimp dumplings.Shrimp Rice Rolls: So good! The sauce is everything and the rice rolls are so soft.Cold Spicy Noodles: Once again, the noodles tasted so fresh I swear they must make the all the dough for the dumplings/noodles in house. The taste is definitely legit Szechuan-style but pretty spicy.Eggplant-stuffed with shrimp: This was sooooo flavorful, definitely get this. I don&#39;t even really like eggplant but this was so good!Overall, a little pricey, but it&#39;s definitely top-quality authentic dimsum/Szechuan food. Dim sum craving satisfied!!

Didn&#39;t expect to have such good dim sum in Castro, but I was pleasantly surprised.The prices are a little steep for certain dishes here, at least considering that it&#39;s for dim sum. For example, the shrimp rice noodle roll was $8. That was a little crazy to me, but maybe that&#39;s just my LA roots talking from being used to cheaper dim sum dishes.Otherwise, my boyfriend and I ordered a bunch of different shumai and dumpling items on the menu, and we enjoyed everything. All of the skins were cooked well and had a great texture, and all the fillings were flavorful.Overall, this is a great place to satisfy a dim sum craving when you&#39;re in the area and don&#39;t feel like going all the way to Inner/Outer Richmond or the Sunset.

What is with the hype? My friend and I left with numb tongues and runny noses because our dishes had an obsessive amount of Szechuan Chili.Mapo Tofu: Look at the photo attached. Spoonfuls of Szechuan chili oil... It has a somewhat bitter flavor and numbs your lips/tongue. Definitely a negative when overused.Triple C chicken: Crumbs of fried batter and chicken. Batter is leaking with oil. Chicken is dry and tough. Other than Szechuan chili flavor, it is very bland with no seasoning.Potstickers: I am shocked that they&#39;re somewhat known for their dumplings/potstickers. The skin is thick and doughy. Outsides were extremely oily. Low pork filling ratio. Worst potsticker I&#39;ve ever had. And 5$ for 3 pieces??They seem to have cool imported beers but price is steep for 11$ a glass.Thanks but no thanks, Mama Ji.

I stumbled upon this gem thanks to yelp! My mom and I had plans and needed to grab a bite to eat before our activity. We usually always plan our agenda out in advance but for some reason we were left in one of those unfortunate situations driving around aimlessly while trying to yelp something good. Don&#39;t you hate when that happens!?Anyways, we found dim sum in the midst of the Castro. I read some reviews where ppl felt the dim sum is basic and to that I say, you&#39;re right, I don&#39;t think they are trying to be a full on dim sum house. They don&#39;t have a full fledged dim sum menu but they do carry a lot of core dishes while also maintaining a big focus on traditional Szechuan cuisine. (Which for those who don&#39;t know, Szechuan is a variant of Chinese cuisine but very different from traditional Cantonese Chinese cuisine which is most prevalent in the Bay Area.)Needless to say, mama ji&#39;s is all about extremely fresh handmade dumplings. It&#39;s like grandmas cooking and my mother and I definitely agreed we had to take grams here asap.What we ordered:Chives and shrimp dumplings - bombShanghai dumpling - comes with 3 in order and ginger. Pretty solid level of soupiness and size.Hand pulled rice wrap with shrimp - very fresh!Pork and shrimp siu mai - one of the best I&#39;ve hadTriple c wings - best wings ever. So juicy with a sweet, spicy, and crunchy skin. So bomb.Totally coming back. They also deliver on caviar so it&#39;s convenient too. Enjoy :)

Checked this place out on our one day driving tour of san Francisco. This place was highly rated on yelp so we stopped in. The seating arrangement was confusing because no one was on staff at the door to tell us whether to be seated or not so we just sat somewhere and the waitresses were very awkward upon taking our order. Beyond that the food was great! I had never had good Chinese food even close to this in Texas. Fresh everything. Fresh steamed and fried gyoza, dumplings, lavender tea and ground beef shanghai noodles. FRESH FRESH FRESH! Definitely will be back.

I&#39;m pretty torn about what to score this place. On the whole, they&#39;re just okay. They&#39;ve changed their menu a lot over the last 6 months (at least it seems that way) and while some of the food is good, some dishes are seriously bland.Let&#39;s go back to my first visit here... I walked over from my Airbnb and was pretty new to dim sum - not to mention San Francisco. I still hadn&#39;t been to Chinatown (or Inner/Outer Sunset &amp; Richmond) and the Castro was really something to see. It&#39;s safe to say the coolness of the neighborhood might have made me think it was better than it was. Among the good food that time were shrimp and shanghai dumplings, fried rice, and some sort of chicken dish. My friend and I left super full and really happy.The second time eating-in was totally underwhelming. There was a super long wait, the service took FOREVER because they &#34;forgot&#34; our order, and then the food was really meh. The bean paste noodles --- not good at all. Dunno why people are stoked about them.Finally, I&#39;ve gotten takeout a few times. This has been fine. It&#39;s just nice to have someone cook for you though. The food is good, it&#39;s served hot, they&#39;re pretty quick and it&#39;s all reasonably priced, but I&#39;m just no longer impressed with the flavors.If you&#39;re looking for dim sum and for some reason you can&#39;t travel anywhere else in the city, go, but would I recommend this place as a go-to spot? Nah.Other notes...-- It&#39;s a bit cramped-- If you order food to go they ask you to wait outside-- Shanghai dumplings are really good-- they serve beer/wine-- they are conveniently located just a few short blocks from the heart of the Castro

With a stop outside San Francisco on our way cross-country, we made a quick visit to the city for dumplings and MaMa Ji&#39;s came out on top. We did dinner, and sadly could not partake of dim sum, but the dumplings were still worth the trip from Orinda. The teeny soup dumplings were yummy - both kinds! - as were the potstickers and shumai. We also got chicken and eggplant which was just a little spicy and excellent, and the beef with fermented green beans which was unlike anything I&#39;ve ever had before - v. interesting and worth a taste. We ended up with way too much food, but lunch the next day was delicious :)

I don&#39;t go outside of the Avenues much when I&#39;m craving dim sum. When I saw Mama Ji&#39;s on Caviar, the roommate and I decided to order lunch delivery on Sunday, October 11th. We placed our order around 12:15pm and it arrived a little over an hour later. Prices below are what I paid through Caviar. Looking at their online menu, I believe the prices are the same.*Shumai: pork shrimp shumai ($4.75)*Shanghai dumplings: contains pork ($4.75)*Har gow shrimp dumplings: shrimp dumpling ($5.75)*Pan fried pot sticker: pork w/ground up shrimp ($4.75)*Dry bean curd skin roll: contains shrimp and pork ($4.75)*Steamed spareribs with black bean sauce ($4.75)*Sweet rice with shrimp sausage and egg wrapped in lotus leaf ($5.75)*Handmade pull rice roll: shrimp rice roll ($8)Overall, the dim sum was average. I enjoyed the ha gow the most as the shrimp were plump and tender. But half the shrimp fell out of their wrappers due to the take out container. They should have used plastic or something slippery instead of paper containers, so the dim sum didn&#39;t stick to the boxes. My least favorite was the lo mai gai (sweet rice wrapped in lotus leaf). It was super bland and the rice wasn&#39;t cooked enough so it wasn&#39;t really sticky. And at $8, the ha cheong (shrimp rice roll) was grossly overpriced.I&#39;m glad I didn&#39;t go out of my way to the Castro to try Mama Ji&#39;s as I don&#39;t think it would have been worth it. I&#39;ll just stick close to home for my dim sum fix.

yelp and SF Magazine, you have failed me. Perhaps this place gets great ratings b/c it is shocking to find a dim sum place in the Castro. And certainly the staff and chef are authentic. Perhaps my palate has become american-ized.I ordered lots of food and kept waiting to find something that merited the 4 stars, but I found nothing.The Xiao Long bao - were a disappointment. did not come with vinegar and ginger - which is standard. Nothing special (only 3 pieces for $4.75)Har gow - nothing specialBBQ pork bun - nothing specialsticky rice - nothing special. and not as soft as others. and they don&#39;t use the standard chinese sausage that is deliciously sweet.House special wonton soup with noodles ($14)- Saltier than anything I have ever had in my LIFE! We had to fix it by diluting it with water! The wontons and noodle were good but the soup was pure salt! and the noodle had a base of salt too.Lava bun - like custard bun but the custard is runny - scary looking and gritty taste.We had been warned about the service - had to ask for forks twice. They told us they ran out of 1 item and took off 1 of the item but not the other one I discussed. but left the other 2 on the bill, so I had to ask for that to be removed. They never gave me my tea that I ordered.The ice water was great, but the refill was not as cold.

Real good down to earth neighborhood jewel. The cold pork belly with hot chilli oil is amazing. Solid dim sum and more than reasonable prices. The hot and numbing fish is served hot and super crispy and the sischuan fish is not to be missed.I&#39;ve read reviews critiquing the service, and it&#39;s true it&#39;s hit or miss, but this is a small family restaurant; sometimes they are overwhelmed but they are ALWAYS happy to serve you. Having said that, service is great most of the time.

TLDR: Mom and Pop Chinese. Everything here is delicious. Especially the dim sum.On a quick layover in San Francisco, I was finally able to try the famous Mama Ji&#39;s, recommended by my sister, who absolutely adores this place. Came here on a Monday around 11ish? And thankfully, guess no one likes Mondays because it wasn&#39;t as packed as people have complained it to be YAY!It&#39;s a very hole-in-the-wall place, and if I didn&#39;t know of it, I&#39;d pass by it without looking back. It&#39;s pretty easy to miss (as someone who&#39;s not from here), because it&#39;s located in a neighborhood area.But let&#39;s talk about the food. WOW. I have been disappointed multiple times by people overhyping restaurants but this place was amazing!! We ordered the har gao (shrimp dumplings), pork and shrimp shumai, the soup dumplings (xiao long bao), Bang Bang chicken, and the fried pumpkin. Everything was so delicious, I can&#39;t even begin to describe it, but I&#39;ll try.Starting with the dim sum: har gao and shumai. I love both those things, and since they&#39;re some of the basic dim sums, hard to go wrong. But the har gao was perfectly juicy and steaming hot. It was pretty packed to the brim with delicious shrimp and was really melts in your mouth good. The shumai taste was pretty average (obviously on the tastier side of average), but the texture was awesome. It&#39;s topped with some kind of fish roe or something and it gives another dimension to the texture, which is really fun.I dedicate an entire paragraph to the xiao long bao (soup dumplings) because I LOVE THEM. I LOVE THEM TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH AND I WISH I COULD EAT THEM EVERY SINGLE DAY BUT UNFORTUNATELY IT IS NOT POSSIBLE. But anyway, the way the XLB is served here is pretty interesting, because it&#39;s not on top of the steam paper on inside of the bamboo/metal steamer like most XLB are. They come in their own cute little scalloped individual tin (almost like an egg tart tin). It&#39;s 3 to a steamer, which isn&#39;t that many, but HO LEE COW. It&#39;s one of the best XLB I&#39;ve ever had. Haven&#39;t had Din Tai Fung, so sorry I don&#39;t know, but this place is juicy and the piping hot soup inside is AMAZING. The only downside it that the XLB wrapper is a little bit thicker than I&#39;m used to, but I can dig it. Doesn&#39;t affect the wonderful taste at all.The Bang Bang chicken was WOW. I love love spicy food, and this totally hit the spot. Perfectly crunchy, and the garlic hits you (in a good way). Some of the best wings I&#39;ve had. Wingstop and BWW, please step up your game (sorry, do you guys have this in California??) Then comes the fried pumpkin. At first, the name was not appealing to me at all--&#34;fried pumpkin with salty duck egg yolks&#34;--??! What?? Do not be repealed by the name! The pumpkin is sweet, and goes well with the saltiness of the egg yolk. The egg yolk gives yet another texture to the fried crispiness of the pumpkin with its soft powdery-ness. At first, the taste is a bit odd, but I found myself liking it more and more and kept eating until I wanted to pass out from food coma.Between 2 people, this was more than enough and we were really really full afterwards. We left with happy bellies. Can&#39;t wait to visit again.

Mama Ji&#39;s is a decent spot if you are trying to stay within walking distance of Haight or Castro. Their version of eggplant and shrimp was better than others since it was fried. I also liked the shrimp and pea shoot dumplings. The shanghai dumplings, shu mai, bbq pork steam buns were okay. They forgot a couple dishes and appeared to be shorthanded.

A favorite neighborhood restaurant, for us it&#39;s walking distance so we frequently pop in for dim sum or the spicy cold noodle craving. We love the service and how quaint Mama Ji&#39;s feels like your sitting among family having a good meal.Shanghai Dumplings, Shrimp Stuffed Eggplant, Crispy Spring Rolls and Dry Fried Green Beans are our favorites.The Spicy Cold Noodles were my favorite, now see how I said &#34;were&#34;. We came here last night and ordered our favorites just like normal. Out came dim sum and followed with the Spicy Cold Noodles, right off the bat I noticed they were completely different. Usually it&#39;s a gorgeous bed of thick egg noodles that&#39;s mixed table side. This dish was just a blob of tiny string noodles mushed together in a ball that the server couldn&#39;t even mix. Not appetizing looking at all. This dish use to be gorgeous and now it&#39;s just a mess. Not to mention it did not taste the same, we actually sent it back because of how bad it was. And I never send anything back no matter how much I detest something so that just gives you an idea of how much they messed up this dish.So apparently they changed the recipe that day and now will be using the little noodles drenched and mushed in sauce. I am so sad over this change.I love this place and supporting the staff at Mama Ji&#39;s but some changes aren&#39;t always good ones, especially when it&#39;s a dish that kept us coming back.

Was craving dim sum and it was perfect because I was in SF, it was the weekend before Chinese NY, and this place was half a mile away!There was no wait and the food came out pretty quick as is the case with all asian places.We ordered the veggie pot stickers, spring rolls, vegetable clay pot, and kung pao tofu. All were delish! The clay pot had some really good mushrooms and the kung pao tofu was crispy and soft in all the right places. Spice level was high, just like we requested.They have beer/wine with a pretty good assortment of both. Neither are really that cheap though. I just got a blue moon because it was $5 since the other stuff, both bottle/draft was more like $7-10.Food prices were normal.. entrees $10-13 and potsticker/dumplings $5ish. Not super cheap like you might get in Chinatown but definitely affordable.The server was a very..ya know.. we were in the Castro ;) He was exuberant and fun. Only weird thing was that he was hovering over me when I was signing the check/writing his tip down.

A couple Sundays ago, my friends and I wanted to get dim sum, but the usual Richmond spots were overflowing with people. We decided to come here since we had to get one of our friends from the Castro anyway. I wasn&#39;t sure how to feel about a restaurant with Szechuan food and Dim Sum under the same roof. That&#39;s weird. It&#39;s like having mushroom risotto and chicken tikka masala on the same menu. I like to think of myself as a pretty open minded person so I mean, why not?Ha Gow - They were plump and filled with nicely cooked shrimp. The shrimp stuffing was underseasoned and needed more young bamboo though. Also, the skins were too tough. Most Bay Area Dim Sum places make ha gow skins too delicate, but MaMa Ji&#39;s fall on the other side of the spectrum.Siu Mai - Not enough shrimp or shiitake. The flavor is mostly dominated by the ground pork so it could use some more balance.XLB - Plump and juicy. The skin wasn&#39;t too thick, and there was a good amount of broth inside. Some more ginger and green onions would help, but these weren&#39;t bad at all.Pan Fried Radish Cake - These tasted pretty good. There was a good amount of radish, dried shrimp, and Chinese sausage mixed in. The thing that bothered me was that they didn&#39;t seem pan fried enough. They came out piping hot, but there was zero browning on the top and bottom. I&#39;m not sure how to explain that.Sticky Rice Wrapped in Lotus Leaf - The rice was stuffed with a good combination of pork, shiitake, and dried shrimp. I like having some Chinese sausage in there, but it&#39;s not crucial. One thing that stood out to me was that there was a plain egg yolk inside. Usually when there&#39;s an egg yolk inside the rice, you&#39;re supposed to use salted egg yolk as a flavoring agent. A plain egg yolk doesn&#39;t really add much to the rice. I don&#39;t even like sticky rice with the egg yolk, but if there&#39;s one inside, it should be salt brined.Fried Shrimp Balls - These were probably the best thing we had here. Thin, crispy waves of batter on the outside with juicy, tender shrimp paste on the inside. There&#39;s not much to complain about.We also ordered a Szechuan dish just for the heck of it. I&#39;m a big fan of Szechuan style garlic pork belly, but the one at MaMa Ji&#39;s wasn&#39;t all that great. The pork wasn&#39;t very tender, and the sauce wasn&#39;t that flavorful. I could taste the highlighting flavors of garlic and Szechuan peppercorns, but it didn&#39;t have a strong base. Maybe it needed more soy sauce or stronger stock, but I think there are better versions elsewhere. Little Sichuan in San Mateo and Z&amp;Y in Chinatown make great garlic pork belly and Szechuan food in general.Given the location, it&#39;s hard to expect MaMa Ji&#39;s to compete with more established restaurants in other parts of the city. For a place that stands out by offering this kind of food in the Castro, it&#39;s fine.

Best Hunan Chinese in San Francisco. Nothing fancy, a bit off the beaten path about 6 blocks off the Castro strip. Parking is difficult.The staff is friendly as can be and the food is fresh and spicy. Expect a wait at busy times.I have been 5 times now and keep going back. I have had the Shrimp, the Shanghai Dumplings, the Eggplant, the Green Beans, the Cumin Lamb. All really authentic, unique and very tasty. Portions are generous and reasonably priced.However, I was on one occasion disappointed with my order: whole fish. The spice level was high, but I can take it hot. However, the fish was so salty as to be inedible. They did not offer to get me something else. So only one disappointment in 5 visits, hence only 4 stars.For those who don&#39;t stray far from Har Gow and Su Mai, you may not be impressed. They probably don&#39;t make these everyday staples in house anyway. I don&#39;t know why they call it a Dim Sum restaurant because there aren&#39;t many Dim Sum items. Stick to the entrees they make in house.

A surprisingly dependable place for real dim sum in a neighborhood that seems to lack quality dining establishments, let alone authentic ones. While it&#39;s not the bestest dim sum ever, everything on the menu is definitely legit. Stalwarts like har gow and siu mai are well-done and well-portioned, and the prices are quite decent. Service is fast and efficient, and the people who run this place are bona fide Chinese folks.If you&#39;re from the neighborhood, this is actually a dim sum experience worth staying close to home for, instead of spending lots of time venturing elsewhere.

Food was amazing. Spicy where your lips are burning and you&#39;re happy about it. We ordered a bunch of appetizers and entrees and shared family style to have a taste of everything, and were not disappointed. The only thing that threw me off was how the xiao long bao was served - in these little foil tins. Not how I am used to. We sat in the back towards the kitchen and it got a little warm back there. Service was off and on. The most annoying thing was that they would only split the bill three ways. We made do but if you&#39;re splitting the bill evenly, what&#39;s the big deal?

Wasn&#39;t a huge fan. The line was long, the space is small and the food was mediocre. We came for dimsum, which should have been a warning sign - a Szechuan restaurant serving dimsum? Dimsum is a traditionally Cantonese food and should not be spicy at all.The best thing was probably the spicy cold noodles - which makes sense, because it&#39;s szechuanese, but even that was a bit strange, using egg noodles, more typical of Cantonese cuisine.

Why did I not pay closer attention to this place when I lived in the heart of the Castro??? I live with regret.My favorite dishes are the fried eggplant (deep fried, fluffy, battery fluff, yum) and the beef chow mein (I have no idea what they put in this stuff that makes it so addictive, but it&#39;s more complex than your standard old mein). I just love these hole in the wall places with great food and muy fantastico prices and just a very low key vibe. A super awesome find in a neighborhood that honestly is very limited in down to earth good food. You get tired of the slice of pizza after awhile, ya know what I mean?I will be back to try the dim sum.

The food was definitely good! They had a good variety of dishes and each was definitely a good portion.Their soup dumplings came in foil bowls rather than spoons which was interesting but I ate it nonetheless.The service was friendly, but minimal, which was fine since I was honestly too busy stuffing my face! I would definitely come back if I was in the area again

This place is alright... and it&#39;s pretty expensive. I thought all of the dishes were a bit on the salty/oily side, but it wasn&#39;t terrible. After trying many of dim sum places in Los Angeles, this place is mediocre.Also, I ordered to-go after my meal and our server literally mixed the dim sum dishes together in one container. Not sure if that&#39;s a thing, but I wasn&#39;t too pleased with that. Anyways, there are better dim sum places out there :P

As a Sichuanese, I would say this place is quite good, delicious, the menu may be 80% authentic, but it&#39;s a pleasant selection of Chinese cuisines from various geo locations. The dim sums are okay, a bit on the dry side, but at least it is available in Castro! It&#39;s something to treasure. The Sichuanese food is rare in this location too, but actually quite good. I would say these are sichuanese food reimagined with local ingredients : jalapenos, carrots, silky Japanese style tofu and Mexican chilli peppers (different from Sichuanese peppers and pepper corns).Ants on the tree, sounds disgusting but a true delightful traditional must-try Sichuanese dish. Just means minced pork on sauteed nearly dry silver glass noodles. Chili pepper fish fillet and silky tofu, definitely a favorite of many locals. If you are Sichuanese it&#39;s mild, else it is still ab it spicy / or shall we say it brings a heat. The fish fillets are soft and melts in your mouth.We got shrimp dumpling appetizer, small 4-piece translucent dim sum style dish. It was a bit dry, not very delicious. Another appetizer was the turnip cake, can barely taste the turnip, which is good, else it will be bitter, but it&#39;s greasy and flavorful, soft and yet crispy on the outside. Quite delightful. A more oily Chinese style mini appetizer.My friend wants an asahi beer :P not Chinese, or a Tsingdao. He just wants something light. The waiter answered we only serve belgium beers. Wat? But cute.There are sparkling, red, white.... pretty decent selection of wines, not usually avialable in Chinese cuisines.This place is quite a gem really suits the local diverse taste and the local residents who may enjoy some heat in their bites but not .... terrible next mornings.

A little on the expensive side, but definitely my go-to dim sum spot. The soup dumplings are delicious, fresh and always piping hot (be careful). They use fresh and flavorful ingredients that will make your taste buds sing for their MaMa.In addition to the soup dumplings I recommend the bbq pork buns, the chicken chow mein and pot stickers - hard to go wrong here.

When I first moved to Castro, I had to get my bearings by Yelp searching all my culinary essentials... including dim sum. It has taken me months to finally end up here, and alas I&#39;ve tried MaMa Ji&#39;s dim sum. I came here with my boyfriend on a Saturday morning (brunch time) and was pleasantly surprised to find that the restaurant was nearly empty. Shockingly I&#39;m learning from other Yelpers that the line can get pretty long. Didn&#39;t seem to be the case that morning.I love Szechuan food, but I was in the mood for some good ol&#39; dim sum. Gotta try the basics first. We ordered the shrimp rice roll, pork shrimp shumai, shrimp dumplings, deep fried meat dumplings, and sweet rice. Clearly we like shrimp. All the things we ordered were pretty standard. My favorite was the sweet rice. I like almost anything wrapped in lotus or banana leaves.They failed to bring us one of our orders by the time our check came, which is also reflective of the fact that the service here is kinda iffy. Anyways, I&#39;m glad I finally got to try MaMa Ji&#39;s. I&#39;ve eaten at more better dim sum places in Daly City and the Sunset District, but this place is pretty close to where I live, so it&#39;s a convenient option!

Having just moved to SF from South Bay, my bf and I were excited to check out dim sum here. We ordered the below:Chicken &amp; Shrimp Shui Mai: Good, but just 4 pieces for $4.75. That&#39;s more than $1 a piece!Shrimp &amp; Cilantro Rice Roll: Also good but not spectacular. My biggest gripe was that they barely put any sauce in! It was kind of bland and I had to dip in soy sauce instead. For $8 I expected much more.Pork Rib: Disappointing. This one took forever to come out and it was way too hot. I burned my tongue eating a piece. Also too fatty. I&#39;ve had better.Fried Eggplant w/ Stuffed Shrimp: I think this was the best dish we had and I liked it a lot. Only three pieces but they are pretty huge.Overall tasty but way too overpriced. Our bill came out to be almost $30 with tax and tip and we left hungry. I think we&#39;re still spoiled by South Bay dim sum cause prices are so much cheaper and the food is better. I probably won&#39;t return.

I really don&#39;t understand the high reviews on Yelp for this. We&#39;ve had take out here on two occasions. Neither were spectacular.The steams pork buns lacked filling, and the bread wasn&#39;t as fluffy as it should be. And the quality of the food didn&#39;t seem as fresh as many other Dim Sum locations?The second experience is what takes the cake. The food is probably a 3-star level, but one of us got food poisoning from their seafood options.To everyone else fortunate enough to have a better experience, I envy you all. But I for one, am not going back.

MaMa Ji&#39;sSF: Castro2pm Wednesday 15th April 2015Four StarsChecking off places on Sara&#39;s to eat list. Mama Ji is the name of a divine character in Neil Gaiman&#39;s American Gods. I am glad to say that this dim sum restaurant was just heavenly. We enjoyed our meal outside with the pup. The black tea came in a cool container/mug. We ordered vegetarian to share. The veggie steamed buns contained mainly mushrooms. They were surprisingly delicious and flavorful. The shrimp dumplings (shumai) lacked the traditional pork flavor making it feel incomplete. The shrimp dumpling (Ha Gao) was amazing. The supple rice wrapper encased perfectly cook baby shrimp. Overall this place had great but okay service.Next time: soup dumplings and meat.

This place was super weird. They gave me and my cousin one menu to share, one drink menu, and one piece of paper and a pencil to check the boxes on our dimsum order. When we ordered, they took the menu out of hand, and wrote it down on the dimsum sheet instead. The first item we got was wrong, and they were served with the dessert items, which seemed odd. They then gave us the check without refilling our water, or asking if we our order was good, or if we wanted anything else We didn&#39;t get the last item we ordered until we asked for it again, after they gave us the check; they said we didn&#39;t know we ordered it, but we both saw her write it on the dimsum sheet. While we were eating they started to yell at incoming customers, telling them they were closed. Not politely saying &#34;I&#39;m sorry, we close from 2:30 to 5:30&#34;, but just &#34;no, we&#39;re closed&#34; while several groups of people were clearly eating.The food was good, but I wouldn&#39;t go back.

My friend recommended this place, so I turned to yelp to see what they had to offer besides dim sum. I was hoping they would have chow fun on their menu (if you know me, I lalalove chow fun. I could eat that errrryday for the rest of my life!!!!) but I didn&#39;t see any on their yelp menu or photos. Booo!We came here on a Saturday night. The restaurant was jam packed at the time. It was about a 20 min wait for a party of 3 (we waited outside in the cold brrrr). After being seated we were handed the menus and I scanned it...hard. What caught my eye were the shrimp dumplings and the shanghai dumplings (you know..the one with the soup inside). When I turned to the back of the menu it had a list of &#34;Tonight&#39;s specials&#34; and to my surprise I saw Beef Chow Fun on the list. I was so happy, like WOW it was my night! *insert crying emoji here *insert XD emoji hereOrders came out in a reasonable amount of time and we dove in.Beef chow fun--Very nommy but was very greasy..It looked like I had lip gloss on after I was finished. It was chow fun with obstacles, I had to dodge the green onions and regular onions (I&#39;m not a fan of either). I guess there was miscommunication with the waiter when I asked him what was in the beef chow fun and he said something about celery and I didn&#39;t want that. Anyways it had a good amount of beef, bean sprouts, and carrots which I didn&#39;t mind. I wanted ordered more but I didn&#39;t want to be the only one eating/finishing it. Plus I would&#39;ve skipped into a foodcoma and I was the driver...Shrimp dumplings--Delishness! especially with the special soy sauce that went with it. My friends and I ordered extra it was so nom nom nom.Shanghai dumplings--It was okay. There was nothing special about them and they didn&#39;t have much soup inside. I&#39;ve had the authentic shanghai dumplings in Shanghai and these were nothing close to the legit ones. The only thing they had in common was prolly the appearance.Overall, service was good, food was good, but parking was a BIT CHallenging! It was so bad that we were so close to not wanting to eat here anymore on the night we went. I think it took us longer to find parking than waiting and eating here. It was so RIDIC! They&#39;re located in a residential area-- we had to park about 3 blocks away. The struggle was real. Would I come here again? of course! if it&#39;s easy to get parking.

I had high expectations for this place after reading the reviews but I was just not impressed. The food was just okay and overpriced. The one item that I really didn&#39;t like were the rice rolls - too much of the rice noodle and it was overcooked. We ordered a couple of other dim sum items like har gow and shiu mai which were good, not nothing special. The service here was also just so-so. The waitresses we not that attentive and it took a while to get the bill and our card back. I probably won&#39;t be coming back, there are much better options elsewhere for less.

Mama Ji tackles two separate Chinese cuisines, Sichuan and Cantonese (Dim Sum) to mixed success. It&#39;s kinda as if you went to a restaurant serving southern style bbq and Maine lobster rolls/new england clam chowder. I grew up eating rice-based foods so given the choice at Mama Ji&#39;s, I opt for Sichuan unless with friends who insist on dim sum.With the exception of one item, most of the dishes were solid but hardly the best Sichuan food I&#39;ve had. Many of the reviewers have mentioned &#34;bland&#34;. Chinese food typically is a bit salty, extra flavorful so that you can eat it with rice in an 1:1 ratio. At Mama Ji&#39;s, it almost as if the rice/carb hating have demanded dishes that can be eaten without rice.The standout menu item for me is &#34;Fried Pumpkin with Salty Duck Egg Yolks&#34;. A really interesting dish that I&#39;ve had not seen anywhere else. At other Sichuan places, I&#39;ve seen it done with corn or green beans.

My boyfriend, his buddy, and I had gone up to San Francisco to hang out for the day. We were looking for a Chinese restaurant, and this place was one of the options that came up. It looked like they had good reviews, so we decided to give them a shot. Not happy, at all.The lady that served us could barely understand any English, so I didn&#39;t get what I was looking for. The menu, itself, was kind of small, so there wasn&#39;t much to choose from. My boyfriend and I had ordered dumplings, but the lady didn&#39;t even ring it! She wrote it down when taking our order, but she didn&#39;t even give it to the cooks. At the end of our meal and we asked, she just had this dumb look on her face. We had ordered the egg custard buns before we got the check, but she didn&#39;t even ring that, either!We don&#39;t come up to SF that often, but next time we do, we are NOT coming back this hell hole of a Chinese restaurant.

Originally came here for dim sum, but as I looked through their dim sum and entree options, we opted for the entrees. In retrospect, I&#39;m really glad we made this decision because their dim sum seemed a bit overpriced.We got the hot and numbing fish and the fish-fragrant eggplant. The hot and numbing fish was definitely hot and numbing on my tongue, but tasted excellent. I echo the other reviews that it&#39;s very addicting. Please be advised that the spiciness level of this dish is no joke, and would only recommend you order it if you can tolerate spiciness. Even my boyfriend who usually tolerates a lot of spice had to down a lot of Sprite in the middle of it! The fish-fragrant eggplant is a misnomer, as it&#39;s actually a vegetarian eggplant dish that is sweet and spicy. I thoroughly enjoyed this as well.I thought the portion sizes were just right and I will definitely return in the near future. Szechuan food is not for everyone, but if you&#39;ve never had it, I would definitely give it a shot. You could also always order foods with no or less than 3 pepper signs.

Wow this place used to be great (talkin about a year or two ago) but now it&#39;s getting uh oh. Just went there for dinner, was soooooo disappointed with the dishes... We ordered the green beans, Mongolian lamb and nam yu spare ribs. I wasn&#39;t looking for full authenticity at a place like this, but how can they charge $13 for a crappy spare ribs dish?? I had the same green beans dish there a year and half ago, it was pretty good but not anymore. I&#39;m so bummed. Really bummed. I love that green bean dish since I lived in China... Mama Ji ruined it. My husband and I walked out angry and decided never to go back again, not even for the dim sum - hey there are plenty of good dim sum places in the city. Don&#39;t get stuck in Castro!

I found the food at Mama Ji&#39;s to be really good at some points and underwhelming at others. The fried green beans and Kung Pao Tofu were both excellent, although the green beans were a little too expensive imo. I also tried the Spicy Cold Noodles and the Vegetarian Potstickers, both of which were average at best. The Spicy Cold Noodles were intensely, intensely spicy to the point of frying my tastebuds for any subsequent flavors.The biggest reason I had a lukewarm experience however mainly had to do with the service. The waiter screamed at me when I asked for water, barked at us in general, and acted frantic and abrupt throughout, even though we came on an otherwise quiet Sunday night. Definitely not rushing to get back here any time soon.

I really wanted to like this place since it seems to have some kind of Michelin nod. But overall this place is totally overrated. I did enjoy certain dishes: soup dumplings, bell pepper with shrimp, pot stickers. However, the kung pao chicken was mediocre and came with cashews instead of peanuts which made the dish very unusual and lacked the peanut flavor. Furthermore, red chiles were the main ingredient instead of chicken. One dish in particular - the sweet rice with shrimp sausage wrapped in lotus leaf and considered a Mama Ji&#39;s &#39;special&#39; was outright inedible. And we got charged nearly $2 for a small bowl of steamed rice.This is not to mention the cost. You are paying for the neighborhood not the quality of the food. We spent $60 on a meal that should have been $25.I am sorry to say I will not return and would recommend sparing your wallet by giving this place a pass.

I loved this place!! Went for the first time today and bookmarked it about 3 years ago to try. I ordered way too much but it was still amazingly delicious when I took it home. I had the rice noodle rolls, shrimp dumplings, potstickers, chive and shrimp dumplings, sesame balls, won ton soup, bean curd skin rolls, a few others and it was all so good! I was not a fan of the cold noodles despite all of the reviews about them, but to each their own. It was not awful, just the only thing I didn&#39;t particularly care for.They were fairly busy and the service was solid.Yes, it&#39;s more expensive than dim sum in Chinatown, but then again I didn&#39;t feel weighed down and thirsty from MSG overload afterward like at other dim sum eateries. I don&#39;t mind spending more money on having higher quality ingredients. Plus it&#39;s very rare to find dim sum available with no MSG.I will definitely be back!

This is not a 4 star Chinese restaurant. I legit question every positive review of this place.This is all based on a takeout order and does not reflect the service at all but only the food.Fried dumplings - too doughyEgg rolls- first thing I tried and were the best part of the meal. Very good.Chicken fried rice- this was insulting. I opened the container and it was regular white rice with veggie and chicken toppings on the edges. Not even mixed in. This is not fried rice.green beans- goodChicken chow mien- had a weird flavor. Was not a fan at all and I love even the shitty chow mien at Panda Express.Broiled beef- had no flavor aside from being way too spicy. Nothing putting it together though.All in all this food was a huge letdown on a rainy Sunday night.

I really wanted to eat here so bad. Eventually, I made it. I drove almost 1.30 hrs on Saturday for lunch here. It was just one party waiting before my party. I ordered most dim sum dishes I usually get from other dim sum places and a few famous dishes mentioned on Yelp.I have to say that the food is made from the good quality ingredients. However, the portion for the price they offered is not worth coming here at all.Here is what I ordered for two ppl:Bbq pork rice noodle roll: the noodle roll is too wet and not much bbq pick flavor.fried shrimp eggplant &amp; Tofu skin roll: way too salty that leave my tongue feels numb.Famous c chicken: no flavor at allSeafood Shumai: okay but I personally don&#39;t like itPea spout shrimp dumpling: the best dish for what I have here today.Seared pumpkin cake &amp; lava bun: it&#39;s just alright.I don&#39;t think I will return. There are many good dim sum in the city and Im willing to wait in the line to eat there. As for Szechuan food, there is one place in Concord where I don&#39;t have to drive this far.

We came here for dinner because we were meeting up with a friend who we thought lived nearby (we were a little off on our guess...whoops!).We showed up and she was still on her way. We were told to put our name on the list outside and we had to wait for our entire party before being seated. For a Thursday night, this place was pretty crowded. A couple tables for two sat empty, so there definitely wasn&#39;t much of a wait, if any. Here&#39;s the breakdown:Service: Friendly service. They took our order with a smile and were attentive.Ambiance: Chill, casual spot. Small. They sat the three of us at a table normally meant for two. We got cozy. Also, we were right by the door, which almost never stays closed (unless you constantly close the hinge on the top of the door every single time after someone enters/exits).Food: After consulting Yelp, we ordered the shrimp dumplings. Chongqing chicken, and dried fried green beans. Nothing really stood out to me. The shrimp dumplings were pretty solid. The chicken was just deep fried chicken and really more of the crispy exterior than chicken. I was a bit disappointed. The green beans were typical - nothing special, but not bad either.Drinks: They have quite an extensive wine list, which includes some pricey bottles. We ordered a bottle of white wine (I forgot what it was called), but it was pretty good. Went down nice and smooth.Would I return? I wasn&#39;t particularly blown away with our food, but the table next to us ordered a couple dishes that smelled really good. It&#39;s a toss up, but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s enough to get me to return. I really wish I could like this place more.

I got an early Tuesday dinner at Mama Ji&#39;s with my friend Yoshi A., largely out of convenience. I&#39;d locked my cell phone in my host&#39;s house and needed to find a place in walking distance, so I was resigned to having a mediocre meal to pay for my stupidity. Turns out this place is a bit of a hot spot for Chinese food in the Castro. I enjoyed my dinner greatly, and wouldn&#39;t mind going back more on purpose in the future.We went at around 5:30, right at opening, and had the place to ourselves for a bit. The space was small and pleasantly homey. There was friendly service to match.The menu offered an extensive selection of dim sum and Sichuan specialties. It was hard to choose what to order with just two stomachs to work with, but we settled on some seafood Shanghai dumplings, spicy cold noodles, and fish with chiles and Sichuan pepper. The soup dumplings were tasty, made with pork and maybe shrimp? They were juicy and very hot, but I feel like I&#39;m always burning myself on soup dumplings. The spicy cold noodles were fine, nothing special but easy to eat. The noodles were firm and the sauce had some good flavor. The centerpiece of the meal was really the fish, a giant bowl of fillets swimming in a bright red broth loaded with peppers. The fish was delicious, delicately meaty and permeated by the broth. There seemed to be an endless amount of it, too--must be some cheap-ass fish, not that that mattered at all. The broth was good, spicy and a little bit numbing, if lacking a bit in depth. It tasted great on the fish and splashed over rice.Mama Ji&#39;s isn&#39;t the best Chinese restaurant I&#39;ve ever been to or anything, but it&#39;s a solid joint in a central location with seriously satisfying food. I&#39;d make good use of it if it were within walking distance of my house. I might even come to depend on it.

My boyfriend and I both love Asian food and choose this place due to good reviews, but I wish we wouldn`t. We have specifically told our server that we`d like our dishes to not be spicy, still both of them came EXTRA spicy. I politely asked the server if he might have forgotten to mention our request to a cook. He quickly grabbed my dish only, promising to change it (would be nice if he have wondered about my boyfriend`s dish, as it was extremely spicy as well) After a few minutes he brought my dish back, it was less spicy, but so salty that it was just impossible to eat. We just paid our bill and left hungry and disappointed. There is absolutely nothing to like about this place: interior, service, food could be much improved.

Uh oh! Ch-ch-ch-changes! Unfortunately not in a good way. Stopped in for dinner last night.Most of the dim sum menu unavailable during dinner.Caviar has doubled their kitchen wait time so the food came out one dish at a time, by the time the second dish was out we had already eaten a full large dish.The XLB, this place always did a hot fresh good XLB. Last night these little puppies came out late and collapsed. They looked about as sad as we did. The top of the bao was leathery from what seems to be from sitting in the kitchen for awhile before they made their debut. The soup had re absorbed back into the skin and the top was leathery.The green beans and Kung pow chicken came out delicious but the timing only allowed us to eat one at a time.Not rating based on service, but the negligent service was a shock compared to the usually friendly and fast service.The additional delivery services they&#39;re working with r taking a toll and I hope they work out the kinks.I might attempt again for lunch, of course after a much needed break.

We were massively disappointed... We came here because this place received Michelin recommendation this year, despite the hype, below are reasons why we think this is such a disgrace to Michelin and Szechuan cuisine.Food: some of the spicy dishes are too spicy and yet not savory, the chef must blindly throw chilies and thought the spicy it gets the more &#39;authentic&#39; people will think of it. Growing up in Szechuan myself, I feel sad that people will associate this restaurant with my hometown cuisine.Service: the waiter and mama Ji constantly mess things up! During our 40min meal there, they misplaced an appetizer and water on our table which were ordered by guests sitting next to us. And needs us to remind them we ordered chili fish not beef twice! Finally they brought us two wrong checks before finally giving us the right one.Price: despite the mediocre food and absent minded service, don&#39;t get misled to think this is your average cheap Chinese eatery: two of us spent over $60 for 3 simple dishes and a beer.I feel obligated to write this review to inform you, my fellow yelper, so you don&#39;t have to repeat our costly mistake.

Husband and I went here on a memorial day weekend Sunday. There was no line, and it was not crowded inside. The food came really quick and the staff was very nice!We went for the dim sum menu. The way of ordering reminded me of tacky all-you-can-eat sushi restaurants in Amsterdam. Giggle :-)Very nice menu though! We each chose 3 dishes and had 1 dessert (sesame balls). I have had several dim sum restaurants in my short history of dim sum, but this one is definetly one of the two best places to go.The dim sum was really yummy, warm and soft.Definetly a yay for this place!The only not so fun thing was the seating. We sat close to the door which didn&#39;t close by itself, so we had a lotta refreshing winds waving through our hair :-)

The food was pretty good here. I just have high standards for authentic schezuan cuisine. I do think it could&#39;ve been spicier. We ordered dumplings, spring rolls, pork chow mein, cumin lamb, and pork spareribs. The sauce on the pork spareribs was really flavorful. I added the chili sauce on the table to the chow mein and it tasted awesome. The cumin lamb was really good. Very tender. Our server was wonderful. The other staff was ok. They snapped at me a couple of times when we got there about signing up on the list and wouldn&#39;t seat us until the entire party arrived even though I saw other tables seated while they were waiting for people. The restaurant is small - not good for large groups. Up to 5 or 6 people would be the max.

A decent place if you can&#39;t get to the avenues for dim sum or don&#39;t want to wait in line. We tried the cold noodles, shanghai dumplings, pork siu mai, and rice noodle shrimp dumplings. The cold noodles were unappetizing and flavorless, so perhaps they have other better noodle dishes. The dim sum was decent but falls apart; the shrimp constantly slipped out of the rice noodle dumpling and a shanghai dumpling popped open. The good thing is that service is quick but I probably won&#39;t be back and would rather drive a bit further for my dim sum.

Uhm. Well first things first, I wasn&#39;t expecting this restaurant to be so...Americanized. I guess its location in the Castro was a pretty good hint that dim sum was not a common cuisine in that neighborhood, but still I was expecting something more authentic and Chinese-y when I was reading the yelp reviews. Instead of that rowdiness and loudness I normally associate with going out to eat dim sum, my experience at Mama Ji&#39;s was surprisingly quiet and civilized (I&#39;m only half joking). The restaurant itself is a sit-down environment, rather than the round tables with dim sum cart pushers walking to and fro. What is normally a half sheet of 8x11 paper given with a little pencil at most other dim sum places, the ordering sheet here was a piece of paper complete with full-on color, sufficient English titles of the dishes, and pictures (that&#39;s practically unheard of!) I was so amazed for the first 5 minutes because I&#39;ve never seen such a well-done ordering sheet in my life. I didn&#39;t even want to write on it, but I was hungry...so I did.Here, dim sum is served all day, which you order on their glossy colorful ordering sheet, or you can order from their regular bound menu. We only ordered dim sum at our particular visit last week, but we saw other people enjoying dishes off their regular menu that looked amazing!Just a few comments on the dim sum we ordered:-for the most part, I was able to recognize the dishes on the menu, but their selection is extremely limited compared to a legit dim sum place. But it is reasonable to say they have a smaller menu since their size is a lot smaller and the restaurant does not have the capacity to offer as many dim sum selections as other established dim sum joints.- soup dumplings were served with tin cups underneath..what&#39;s up with that? Never have I ever been served soup dumplings that way (see pic.) it was just a bit off-putting for me, and ruined the experience of eating them as all the soup would fall out when you peel the dumpling off the cup. Oh, and also, they&#39;re tiny as hell. I could eat one in one bite if I really wanted to. (PS: make your own soup dumpling sauce with the vinegar, soy sauce, and chili oil.)- shrimp shumai was on the better side of ok. Meat was juicy but it tasted a little bit sweeter than what I&#39;m used to tasting with shrimp shumais?- rice roll plates were close to 75% rice roll and 25% meat (in our case, we ordered shrimp rice rolls, and there were only 3 pieces of shrimp lying in a huge bed of rice sheet). We did not finish this dish because it just did not taste right with the disproportionate ratio.-pea sprout shrimp dumpling: I DO recommend this dish. It&#39;s awesome, try it.- steamed pork buns was too dry for my taste. Bleh.- lotus rice order was made traditional and was wrapped with not only the tea leaf, but also two layers of paper. Talk about really unwrapping your meal before you eat it. Made with dried shrimp and salted duck yolk, which are traditional ingredients, but over all, it tasted a lil bland.In general, I do not consider myself a picky person but after reading what I wrote in this review, I am reconsidering that conception. I do say that I enjoyed my meal here at Mama Ji&#39;s but not as much as I could have, knowing that I&#39;ve had much much better dim sum experiences. Also, the prices are higher, with portions smaller, for what I&#39;ve had before, which comes to no surprise, given its location. Overall, I cannot see myself making a special trip back to this place for dim sum when there are way better places in Chinatown, but if I ever do find myself in that neighborhood with a killer craving for dim sum, yall already know I&#39;ll be at Mama Ji&#39;s.

When I tried the vegetarian steamed buns, I smiled like a Cheshire cat with every bite.Best way I have ever been served mushrooms. I don&#39;t know how to properly describe such a flavor. It positively danced on my tongue. I really have never had anything quite like it. The soft sweetness of the perfectly steamed bun melting on my tongue against the umami of mushrooms and veggies seasoned in a way I&#39;ve never tried before--it was veggie heaven. I really cannot complement those steamed buns enough. It was an entirely new experience which hit an absolute home run in both texture and flavor.If I was a resident of San Francisco, this would become one of my consistent haunts. Do yourselves a favor, vegetarians, and get to Mama Ji&#39;s.

In Hong Kong, we refer to a Dim Sum outing as &#39;YumCha&#39;. Which literally translates to &#39;drink tea&#39;. Tea is a very important component to the Dim Sum experience. In fact, a Dim Sum guru would even argue that sampling different types of tea(Bow Lay, Teh Kuan Yin, Oolong) is actually the essence of YumCha.Mama Ji&#39;s served us Ice Water.Mama Ji&#39;s is an up and coming Dim Sum place located in the Castro district. Word on the street is that the Dim Sum here is very traditional, and hipsters around the area have been flocking to Mama Ji&#39;s to get a taste of Hong Kong. But seeing as how there are no tea kettles on the tables here, this is definitely not the place to get that HongKong DimSum experience.The jury&#39;s still out on the quality of the DimSum. I admire that the dumpling stays intact throughout my struggles with the chopsticks. A sturdy dumpling is a good dumpling, and that&#39;s definitely not easy to make. Mama Ji can work on the taste a little bit tho. There is no MSG but the food was pretty bland. It doesn&#39;t help reduce my sodium intake if I have to drown my Shui Mai in a pool of soy sauce yadada?I guess Mama Ji&#39;s is still alright, as long as they don&#39;t start calling DimSum &#34;Chinese Tapas&#34;

I went there because of the recommendation of Michelin guide, but ended up so disappointed. Compared to many Chinese restaurants I tried in Bay Area, their foods are mediocre and seriously over-priced. Also, the waitress and waiter messed up our orders with our neighbor&#39;s several times :( I feel really bad if people think these are authentic Chinese food, and don&#39;t understand why Michelin recommend it. Definitely won&#39;t go back again and won&#39;t recommend any of my friend go there.

Just like others said, it depends what you want:Food is pretty good, although the mapo tofu is very Americanized. Crispy fried fish is tasty. Chimay beer is of the Red variety, not Blue, not specified on the menu and no one seemed to know so just had to order to find out.Service is really uneven. Either they&#39;re on top of it or often you&#39;ll wait for a long time (20 minutes) for your menu or check, whether it&#39;s quiet or there&#39;s a long line waiting to come in. Also, when we received the wrong order, we were blamed for it...even though the whole table heard our entree list. Funny that being blamed by the waiter made our out-of-town guests remark about the authenticity of Chinese customer service.As per Ben L. and Corey&#39;s reviews, the back of the house (cooks) are much better and more organized than the front of house, a mix of nice, unfriendly or disorganized waitstaff.

Please believe me when I say that this place serves terrible dim sum. Out of the 6 dishes we ordered, only the seafood shumai turned out to be really good; the rest are really terrible (yes, the contrast is quite stark).CRISPY SPRING ROLLSNot good. Authentic spring rolls should be stuffed with steamed turnip strips, which gives the spring rolls a fresh flavour by countering the oily taste from the deep-frying. These spring rolls were stuffed with cabbage strips, which added to the oily taste. Not good. =(STEAMED BBQ PORK BUNSAny self-respecting dim sum place should get this staple dim sum dish right. But their buns were not nearly as nice as they ought to be: the meat was too hard (the fats didn&#39;t melt into the meat like they should), and there isn&#39;t enough gravy in the bun to keep the insides moist. The result is a slightly chunky and dry bun. Real BBQ pork buns taste waaaay better than this. =(SHRIMP STUFFED EGGPLANTSThe shrimps are deep fried, and taste like fish cake. I think that pretty much sums this dish up. I was SOOO disappointed with this dish, because I like eggplants so much.SEAFOOD SHUMAIFinally, a really decent dish!! This tasted good; the prawns were succulent and not fish-cake-like, and it tastes just like how it should. You should order this dish, if you really have to eat here.FRIED RICEThis was terrible. Real fried rice should have a fragrant &#34;wok&#34; flavour, where the rice is semi-caramelised. It&#39;s the signature flavour of all fried rice. This is just rice tossed with MSG in a pan (and it&#39;s really too salty). It&#39;s a shame to call it fried rice.SHANGHAI DUMPLINGSAfter reading the raving reviews about the Shanghai dumplings (xiaolongbao), we decided to give it a try and give this place one last chance at redemption. It was a mistake. If you think that this xiaolongbao is good, wait till you taste the real ones.1) the skin is too thick; real xiaolongbaos have thin skins that house the meat and soup within.2) there isn&#39;t enough soup in the dumpling. The soup is a signature of xiaolongbaos.3) the meat tastes bad; it doesn&#39;t taste very fresh.Oh, and they also don&#39;t share their wifi password. =(

Very poor service, multiple tables seated after us were served their food before we even got to order. Nothing that we ordered made up for the long wait. The numbing fish had a weird spicy flavor, and we couldn&#39;t get our waters refilled after our mouths were on fire. We both had upset stomachs and the bathroom was out of order so we had to run home. Bad, bad, bad.

Came here with a group of friends under the strong recommendation by one of them. I was not disappointed.The chongqing chicken / la zi ji is highly recommended! Slightly tangy and spicy, this dish is definitely rather authentic.The dim sum here is pretty decent, but definitely not as wow as how the other reviewers make it out to be. I&#39;ve definitely had much better.The restaurant itself is pretty small, so if you have a large group, definitely do be prepared to wait a longer time for your table!

Vegan Factor: 3.5 StarsTook some menu hunting and verbal confirmation from the waiter, but when all said and done, the vegan dishes were solid.Food: 4 Stars1. Vegetarian Pot Stickers: Questionably non-vegan, but I love &#39;em fried! Blame the bottle of wine (clearly cheaper than buying by the glass even for someone as mathematically challenged as me). But that&#39;s ok. Non repeater. Better options on the menu.2. Stir-Fried Pea Leaves with Garlic: I love all variations of this dish and this one did not disappoint.3. Fish Fragrant Eggplant: The star of the night. Don&#39;t be fooled by the name, this dish is all vegan. The spices used are usually reserved for a similar dish made with fish. Best ordered w/ rice to soak up the dark, fragrant sauce. Oh, and wait for the eggplant to cool before biting into one.Repeatability: 4 StarsThere&#39;s a reason why there&#39;s always a line at MaMa Ji&#39;s. The ten minute wait was worth it.

Huh? How does this place have four stars?!

After one visit, MaMa Ji&#39;s has made a really great first impression. Everything we got was good. Out of the feast we ordered, I really enjoyed the Fried Pumpkin with Egg Yolk, the Seafood Shumai, and the massive Pan-Fried Pot Stickers. My dining partner loved their Crispy Eggplant. If you want something green, try the Stir Fried Pea Leaves in Garlic Sauce.As always, I got some Steamed BBQ Pork Buns; the bread was soft, but there could&#39;ve been more pork inside. The Shanghai Dumplings were good, but not the best I&#39;ve had in the Bay Area (that prize goes to Panda Dumpling in San Carlos).Dessert was awesome. My dining party really enjoyed their Seared Pumpkin Cake. They also serve cookies from Black Jet Bakery: my friend was into their Oreo Cookies and I devoured a delicious Peanut Butter cookie and a Granola with Cream cookie.In short, tons of enjoyment from start to finish. Thanks, MaMa Ji&#39;s!

Quite a decent dim sum place in the Castro! I&#39;ve been a few times with friends for brunch and their dim sum is tasty and fresh. The sizes are a little bit small for items like har gow but prices are still low, especially for the Castro.I&#39;ve enjoyed most of their typical dim sum dishes like har gow, siu mai, lo mai gai, and such. You can also try some of their Sichuan dinner items like the specialized Chongqing chicken, which is the Sichuan fillet fish in mala oil, fried.Expect the wait to be really long on the weekends on a sunny day and the service to be a bit scattered.

Brought my visiting family to Mama Ji&#39;s - they wanted Dim Sum. I&#39;m not in the city that often so needed some help to find where to get our dim sum - and I found this place from Yelp. Huge success!Mama Ji&#39;s is a small restaurant on 18th near Castro - probably not good for groups unless you come at an off-peak time when they could slide tables together. You won&#39;t be here for the decor or the ambiance, but you&#39;ll come back for the food.The dim sum were so much better than my standard go-to spot - fresher, interesting flavors, different types and varieties, buns with so-good fillings.I&#39;ll be baack!

Was actually kind of disappointed with this place. First off, I really like that their menu has pictures of all the things your ordering. The place is also pretty cute, though there were lots of flies by our table...Though severely understaffed (maybe because it was a holiday?), the waitress was pretty nice.The food was good enough... I have definitely had better dim sum. I was excited to find Xiao lum pbao, but the dumpling itself was so thick and made it hard to enjoy. Kind of pricey for the quality of food. If you&#39;re looking for convenient dim sum in the Castro, definitely a good spot. Otherwise, I would just go to Chinatown for the real deal.

Mixed experience. We ordered vegetarian dumplings which were delicious; they didn&#39;t come with a typical dumpling sauce, so we used soy sauce and it was really good.We also had kung pao chicken which was 90% red and green peppers, 5% chicken and 5% veggies and sauce. The sauce was delicious, but the peppers overpowered the dish and the chicken was all dark meat and not the best quality. My dining partner ordered fried rice to go with it and it was pretty greasy.We then ordered ants crawling up a tree (or something like that -- I always say that incorrectly :) ) and it was absolutely delicious. I was looking for something with a real kick and I got it here! I&#39;ve never had it with the rice noodles and prefer when it&#39;s made with more lo mein-like noodles. But if you like some spice I highly recommend this dish.Extremely affordable; service was good for us, we didn&#39;t experience any of the issues others have. Everyone was very nice to us. If you&#39;re in the Castro, I&#39;d say check it out -- not sure I&#39;d make a special trip as we did, especially considering we&#39;re staying 3 blocks from China Town!

We were looking for rice dishes in the Castro and my friend recommended Mama Ji&#39;s for delicious Chinese and Szechuan delicacies. I went with a party of 5 and they were able to sit us at a table in the back. It was a busy Sunday lunch hour so we lucked out. The service was awesome and the food was very appetizing. The menu tells you if the dish is spicy or not. Three chili peppers means its really spicy. MaMa Ji&#39;s really hits the spot when your looking for great Chinese food.

Came for dim sum, and at first I was a little worried being one of the only Asian people in the restaurant (usually not a good sign for dim sun / Chinese food). However, all the dim sum dishes we ordered were really good, including the xlbs. The shrimp rice roll had cilantro in it which made it a weird flavor, and the combination chow mein was actually not salty enough (very rare in a Chinese restaurant!). A little expensive, but the food is good and the service is fast. Would recommend and come back for dim sum.

4.5 stars overall is a bit of a stretch, really. But if I&#39;m grading on a scale of Castro eateries, perhaps.If you want really legit dim sum, you go to Monterey Park or Alhambra in the LA area. If you&#39;re in the SF area, you hit Chinatown or else go to Koi Palace in Daly City (arrive early). But if you&#39;re in the Castro, and you&#39;re in the mood, and you don&#39;t want to drive (or fly) an hour to get lunch, which would be a reasonable justification for eating in the Castro... then this could be a nice option for you.Pretty decent overall, selection is good, and they do bring it to you quite fresh since it&#39;s made-to-order (no carts here).Great location, super-convenient for Castro folks, and it&#39;s actually above average in quality. Just not a five-star awesome amazing bring all of your friends kind of good place.

Don&#39;t judge the restaurant by its dirty windows. Inside you will find amazing and authentic Chinese food and a simple yet inviting interior. The food is very good.

Came here hungover on New Year&#39;s. Mostly decided to come here because we were too lazy and hungover to go into the Richmond or Sunset neighborhood.3 stars for food and price. Dim sum here is legit. Not the tastiest dim sum ever, but at least it tasted healthy. Also it&#39;s on the pricey side. I think everything cost at least 25-50% times more than your typical dim sum restaurant.We ordered everything on the menu times 2. Turns out that&#39;s a lot of food for 6 people! They served everything in rounds. After about the 4th round of food, we started asking every time if there was more coming hoping the answer would be no.Some of my favorite things about Mama Ji&#39;s are- green bell peppers stuffed with shrimp- sweet rice with egg and sausage filling- shrimp stuffed eggplant- good selection shu mai and other dumplings. they have at least 3 different types of shu mai. omg. also the deep fried meat dumpling is excellent.- their beer, cider, and wine selectionNext time I might skip on the pan fried turnip dish and the shanghai dumplings.I do give them an extra star because MaMa Ji&#39;s had a warm and cozy vibe compared to other dim sum restaurants. Location is great too. Healthy tasting dim sum is a nice change too.Overall, I had a good experience at Mama Ji&#39;s. I&#39;ll definitely be back if it&#39;s convenient. Also to try some of the noodles I saw people eating that looked delicious.

Great Szechuan food with some dim sum options available. All of their spicy items are obviously very good, but if you aren&#39;t a spicy person, I would recommend:Shanghai dumplingsStir friend pea leaves w/ GarlicDry Fried Green beansSweet &amp; Sour porkChicken shrimp ShumaiIt is on the pricier side ($2-3 dollars more than the usual). The shanghai dumplings for example are 3.75 but they only give you 3 of them, whereas for the same price, other places give you 4.Not saying it&#39;s not worth it -- it&#39;s completely worth it if you aren&#39;t able to travel all the way to Chinatown or Richmond for great Chinese food as there really aren&#39;t any other sit down places in the area that are as high quality as this place.There are lineups from time to time but the wait is usually not more than 15m. They take on the longer side to prepare food, however.In terms of ambience - it doesn&#39;t look like your typical Chinese restaurant since it has a pretty modern look. The owner is Mama Ji and her husband who helps seat and greet people and take orders. The space indoors is very crowded in the sense that the tables are all very close together. If you ever need to go to the restroom, be wary of sharing the narrow walking space with waitresses. They have seating outdoors, too, if you don&#39;t mind sitting out there.

Really great szechuan food. No MSG! I adore their hot and sour soup. We also had the kung pao shrimp, dry beef with green beans and vegetable chow mein. Everything is fresh and delicious. Located in the historic Castro distrct, mama ji&#39;s fills up for dnner fast. Go a lttle early to avoid a wait. Dim sum is at lunch time and is not available for dinner. Fast and super friendly service. Big selection of beers. Highly recommend.

We came here for dinner one night and we were hoping to get great Chinese food since they had such high yelp reviews. Be aware that this is Not your standard Chinese restaurant. Chinese food from Szechuan province is definitely different and some of their dishes takes an acquired taste to enjoy it. We ordered the numbing fish dish which was a big letdown. It was basically just fish fillet deep-fried and a whole bunch of peppercorns numb your tongue not much else. I also ordered the beef and gravy and the flavor was just barely edible to me. The other dishes that we ordered were OK.Most of the dishes were very salty even the fried rice. The place has a nice new modern feel to it. I have a variety of very good beer though they&#39;re fairly pricey starting from eight to $50. Definitely a trendy hip place to go to if you&#39;re into that. But if you just want real good Chinese food I drive across town and go to Chinatown. The service was very slowand the food arrived one at a time although most of the servers are nice.

Very cool little restaurant in a nice area of SF with a lot of hills... We were visiting from LA, where we have many good Szechuan restaurants.We tried two Szechuan dishes, not any dim sum. I liked what we had here. The fried fish was amazing, and the chicken in a clay pot (not the official name) was delicious too. Prices for the dim sum was much higher than I&#39;m used too. But I like this place and definitely would return if I lived in this area..

Went as a group to Mama Ji&#39;s recently. The food was excellent, the service was slow. If you&#39;re starving and can&#39;t wait 10 minutes to get a menu and something to drink, you&#39;re better off going somewhere else. However, if you can wait, then this place is worth it. The pork steam buns were great as well as the green beans! I couldn&#39;t replicate or find another place that could. I usually always never finish my plates when we go out, but there was nothing left once I was done! Will definitely be coming here again!

Expensive, average dum sum. Potstickers contained gristle. Shanghai dumplings fell apart. I&#39;ll stick with pretty much anywhere in the Richmond.

I really like this non-traditional dim sum spot. You order off of the menu and they bring it to you like a typical restaurant vs. using carts. I have been a few times and liked everything I have had here. They also randomly have good Belgian beers on tap. Service is friendly and the vibe is casual. All around a nice neighborhood spot.

Great food, fast service, and home-y atmosphere!We got the cucumber salad, which was a phenomenal start -- refreshing and very flavorful. The spicy cold noodles were solid, but lacked any special punch. Wouldn&#39;t order again. The stars where the hot &amp; numbing (Chongqing-style) chicken and fish. They were crispy on the outside, tender on the inside, and spicy and rich with the quintessential Szechuan peppercorn. My mouth was tingling: it was fantastic.Great spot for dates, family dinners, or just hanging out! Not necessarily the most authentic Szechuan food, but boy does it taste good.If you&#39;re up for a challenge, ask your server to make it extra spicy!

Some things are too good to be true.5&#39;10. Handsome. Cunning. Ambitious. Witty. And a charming smile that will make you melt. Ohhh and...a hinny you can bounce a quarter off of.Only boobies don&#39;t make him go ga-ga, pecs do. Ahhh, why are all the hot guys, gay? I&#39;ve never seen such a large congregation of hot guys in one place than the Castro.Anyhow, after reading that there was a new all-day dim sum joint with full service in the Castro, I was thrilled as none exist in San Francisco (Dim Sum King in Pacifica is the nearest one). I had especially high hopes for MaMa Ji&#39;s since early foodie publication reports said that the owners hired a former Koi Palace cook (voted best dim sum in the bay area by SFGate and I agree) but later reports said the cook was from Yank Sing. Regardless of where the cook hailed from, both Koi Palace and Yank Sing are well-known though the latter is more well-known for it&#39;s not very Chinesey prices and catering to non-natives.I&#39;m all about supporting my peeps and mom and pop shops, but MaMa Ji&#39;s dim sum was far from solid with Koi Palace prices at hole-in-the-wall takeout quality that you will find in Sunset or Richmond for 1/3 the cost. If you never had dim sum before then this may suffice but if you&#39;re a dim sum connoisseur, you may be sorely disappointed.The owner was very nice but service was non-existent. We had to go to the counter to order and get our own waters. Our &#34;waitress&#34; lacked basic interpersonal skills and was MIA most of the time. She never checked on us and there was only two other tables there who were laptop camping. I could of cared less had the food been good because inattentive service is a given at most Asian places so I didn&#39;t really factor service into my rating.Back to the main reason we came here: The Dim Sum.Although there&#39;s 40 items listed on the menu ($3-$6 per an order), over 1/3rd of the items were not available the day we went. In addition, some of the things arrived not as pictured on the menu. I&#39;m allergic to MSG and was told they don&#39;t use it; I even asked again in Cantonese to make sure. However, I could immediately tell there was in fact MSG as my tongue went numb and I became very thirsty. Not a good thing as I had to stop eating midway through, though I&#39;m sure my thunder thighs were relieved.Our order:*Woh Tip: Potstickers ($3):bit.ly/10TJIac*Hai Gow: Shrimp Dumplings ($4):bit.ly/16DRpco*Shrimp &#34;Balls&#34; ($4):bit.ly/14oAmUI*Shrimp Stuffed Mushrooms ($4):bit.ly/10LUvqk*Shrimp &amp; Chive Dumplings ($4):bit.ly/14oAzY2*Chicken Siu Mai Dumplings ($3):bit.ly/11RmrKV*Spareribs in Black Pepper Sauce ($4):bit.ly/11mrzF9The best dish was the plump Chicken Siu Mai. Everything else was 2 stars worthy. The Hai Gow was small with not much shrimp filling. The Potsticker&#39;s filling was rancid with an weird aftertaste. The Scallop &amp; Chive Dumpling had a gummy skin and the chive to scallop ratio was way off with just one very teeny weeny scallop bit in each dumpling.The Beef Ribs in Black Pepper Sauce were brought in lieu of of the Spareribs in Black Bean Sauce because it wasn&#39;t available but they didn&#39;t bother telling us until they were handing us the beef ribs. Ugh not wanting to argue over a $4 dish, we said we would take the beef ribs which was just basically scraps of bones and fat.The Shrimp Stuffed Mushrooms were topped with an identifiable opaque white seafoody mousse (4 received versus 8 as pictured on the menu) while the Shrimp Balls were not even balls at all.Sadly, a solid dim sum joint with no MSG in the Castro was just too good to be true. As we were about to leave, the owner asked us if we liked it and I did as obedient Asian would do. LIE. Shake my head. Smile. AND Lie. *sigh*

All the best parts of Dim Sum (the food) without the overly pushy servers. MaMa Ji&#39;s is a casual place that does Chinese well (especially considering it&#39;s in the Castro). Avoid the Shanghai Dumplings, they just don&#39;t get those right. Make sure you get the Lava Balls for dessert.On the non Dim Sum menu try the spicy fish for a (literally) tongue numbing experience.

Came here for a very late dinner with some friends. While the interior of the restaurant is nothing to write home about the Dim Sum we ordered was really good. They are not all authentic but I like their variations- it&#39;s really good and very tasty. Don&#39;t miss their extensive beer menu!We ordered the Seafood Shumai, Shanghai Dumplings, Shrimp balls, Steamed BBQ pork buns, Crispy Spring roll, pan fried pot stickers and my favorite, the green bean dish. Everything was delicious! All the dim sum dishes came out timely, really hot and tasted fresh. I don&#39;t know if the Green Bean dish is regular on their menu but it was highly recommend by their server and we needed a veggie dish to counter all the meats and fish so we ordered it. To my surprise, it was one of my favorites! Excellent service too!

I guess I&#39;m used to paying dirt cheap money for Chinese food. I guess this is what you call &#34;high end&#34; Chinese food, but I still wasn&#39;t very happy about it. I mean, some things were good, but they weren&#39;t AMAZING to be worth the price.We ordered the following:1) SHANGHAI DUMPLINGS: This was a huge disappointment to me. I guess I&#39;m really used to the whole &#34;put it in your mouth and have soup squirt in it&#34; kind of feeling. They came in these little silver cups beneath them, and there was definitely no soup taste within them. Real disappointment.2) BEEF RICE NOODLES: This was good -- not too spicy, and it felt a bit more homie.3) TRIPLE &#34;C&#34; WINGS: This is a definite must-have at MaMa Ji&#39;s. If you&#39;re going to get anything, then get these.4) COUNTRY STYLE PORK: I THINK it was this dish. If it&#39;s fiery hot hot hot, then this is it. My date and I were&#39;t very happy with this dish. We even asked them to cook it mild, and we couldn&#39;t even finish it.The service was kind of funny. We had servers come up to us every 5 minutes to order. We took a while to decide what to get, so it was just quite entertaining for the waiters to keep asking us what we wanted.

I had recently moved into the Casto and a coworker of mine has always lived nearby. He had always suggested to try MaMa Ji&#39;s. Finally had a chance to try it with a friend that loves dimsum after he helped me move places.We got there around 10am or so and there was no line to get seated (about half an hour to an hour later, there was a line out the door waiting). We ordered a bunch of typical dimsum foods, and enjoyed it all very much. Service was spotty, but we got the food we needed and got the water when we needed that too.It is expensive though. eek. Between the two of us, we spent $50.Another time, I&#39;ve got Mama Ji&#39;s delivered to my friend&#39;s place since he really wanted dimsum. Not as expensive, but still pretty delicious. I think getting it to go is much better because some of it was a lot warmer than when I ate it in the restaurant - figures right?Overall, delicious place, a little pricey, but you get what you pay for. I mean, it&#39;s in a neighborhood not known for dimsum.Protip: get there early, and order off the dimsum menu. Hope for the best.

A dim sum restaurant in Castro? Not the typical place to find dim sum in SF but it&#39;s pretty darn good, albeit a bit pricey for dim sum standards.The handmade rice noodle dishes are great here, definitely order the shrimp rice roll ($7.75 whoah!?) and the pea sprout shrimp dumpling ($4.75). Excellent texture on the dough in each bite.Not sure what&#39;s up with the chili bean paste noodles ($8.75) since they came out a bit limp, but the dish was certainly spicy.The pork spare ribs &amp; shiu mai ($3.75) tasted like the usual standard you find anywhere else.Skip the stuffed eggplant ($4.75), the sauce used in this was lacking flavor.Service was okay for a restaurant filled to the brim, expect a long wait during peak weekend hours.I&#39;m not sure why there&#39;s Belgian beer on tap at a dim sum restaurant, must be for hipsters or a confused identity?

I&#39;ve eaten from Mama Ji&#39;s 3 times. The first time I thought it was awesome, but since then it seems to have gotten a lot worse. The dim sum is really subpar for SF - the BBQ pork buns are decent but the pork shumai was mediocre, and the shrimp dumplings were nearly uneatable.Food aside, the service is terrible. The second time I went to Mama Ji&#39;s, we had been waiting ~15 minutes for a check at the end. At one point, one of the waitresses looked at me, I made the hand signal to indicate we wanted a check, and then she just looked away and ignored it! I&#39;ve never had someone purposefully ignore me trying to pay. It&#39;s probably because they&#39;re so busy with the delivery, but even so that was unacceptable for me.The third time I ate from there was delivery (I swear I&#39;d never bother going back to the restaurant after that service), and they made a number of errors in the order.On the plus side, their Szechuan fare is better than their dim sum, and they have really good coffee.

Great to find a new place in the Castro. Unfortunately, the food was sub-par. The chicken was worse than day-old chicken McNuggets. The hot and sour soup was fine. The green beans were fresh but basic and nothing you couldn&#39;t do with a microwave at home. Not a place I would advise. Stick to the regular Castro Chinese haunts.PS - the service was very good, which gives it an extra star for a total of 2 stars

Not your typical dim sum place, even the environment reminded me of an American brunch restaurant. It&#39;s located in a residential neighborhood so it&#39;s small in the Mission. I thought I was in the wrong area, but it turns out it was right there.There was a lot of sunlight in the place, and very simple decore. Did not resemble a Chinese restaurant, but our server was an older Chinese woman, speaking in Chinese.I posted a photo, we got several dishes (we had a group of 7) so we got to try a lot of dishes. It was a little different then a traditional dim sum place -- they had a similar Korean jia-jiang-mien, a Vietnamese dry noodle, a plate of string beans, the hai-gua, sui-mei and some buns. If you were to come here, I would say the noodle dishes stood out to me. If you wanted to eat the traditional hai-gua sui-mei, I would go somewhere else cause it didn&#39;t stand out to me here.The waitress also told us that coming before 12PM is much better because people haven&#39;t woken up yet. They also don&#39;t seat you until your whole party is there. For good dim sum out in Castro, this place is great! I want to come back for their lunch specials, but it takes me about 40 minutes to MUNI here, so IDK!

Have you heard an expression that a dirty restaurant bathroom often means a dirty kitchen? Well, Mama Ji&#39;s restroom was extremely dirty and shabby last time I was there with my friends. Clean place is as important as quality food. I couldn&#39;t relax and enjoy my meal at that restaurant. I worried that my plates could not be washed well etc. In fact, the table we were sitting at, was sticky. I have to say though, I&#39;ve been there a few months ago, hopefully they upgraded their restrooms.

So I live nearby and have watched this place, heard positive things about it and finally tried it.Short version: Food is okay, on the greasy side. Service however is atrocious. 3 stars for food, 1 for service.Had various dim sum/appetizer items. All ended with pools of grease on the plates. Otherwise slightly better than average.The serving staff was clueless. Kept trying to bring us other people&#39;s food. After 3 requests for silverware, with all our food on the table, I finally got up and got it myself. Same with our drink order. After 3 requests, we got half of it.Don&#39;t see any reason to return.

Oh man, I went from 4 stars to 2! I loved this place before and have been coming for a year and a half and would come once a month. This was a place I always recommend to everyone. They took away the dim sum menu for the evening (the whole reason I came here) also they only offer one soup in the evening now. The food has seemed to change and gone down hill as well, doesn&#39;t seem to taste the same. Really disappointed :(

Came here after we found out ramen fest was a bust and all the ramen houses were busy. Luckilynfor us we found this place. Great place to have an enjoyable lunch at an affordable price. The staff is friendly, although it did take us awhile to be seated when a couple tables were free.Its a small restaurant. So small you can touch elbows with the person at the next table. It wasn&#39;t too bothersome though because the service was fast.Big plus for me: they serve ritual. Right off the bat i ordered a latte. It was my day off that day and as a barista I certainly did enjoy this nice surprise that I didn&#39;t have to have to be away from ritual coffee for too long ;)Also, I like the dim sum write-in menu where you can just specify what you want and how many you&#39;d like on the menu. Very easy and so cheap for how good everything was! I recommend the shrimp stuffed mushrooms and the fried shrimp dumplings.The fried rice was a little bit on the salty side. I bit into granules of salt from the egg a couple times. Also, the wonton noodle soup didn&#39;t have any flavor to it at all. I&#39;m sorry to say that the broth tasted like plain waterBesides that, the whole meal was very enjoyable particularly the dim sum and i will definitely come back. i&#39;m sure my other friends would enjoy this place

Great dimsum at great prices! Came here for lunch during the week, and it was surprisingly empty. I&#39;ll chalk that up to the residential neighborhood it&#39;s located in. I don&#39;t quite understand the dings from other reviewers on the service. I thought the service was totally fine, but, again, the restaurant was far from crowded when I was there.The food:- The noodles with chili bean paste were phenomenal! Perfectly spicy with super fresh ingredients. The noodles had an excellent bite, too.- The steamed BBQ pork buns were the best I&#39;ve ever had, period. Perfect texture on the bun itself -- sweet but light. As far as the pork inside, think perfect Chinese sparerib shredded up.- The shanghai (or soup) dumplings were a bit of a let down, though they were at a disadvantage seeing how they immediately followed the life-changing pork buns. They just seemed a little bland and not quite as &#34;soupy&#34; as I prefer.- My girlfriend is a veg, so she got the steamed vegetable dumplings. I gave them a try, and they were delicious. The portion was pretty huge (six in an order).tl;dr MaMa Ji&#39;s is a must try for dim sum lovers!

If I could give this place negative stars I would. We went there and we were asked to put our name on the list (which is a piece of paper hanging on a wall) we were the only people on the list. It was just me and 2 other people with me (so total of 3) we waited for about 15 minutes and still not seated. Then a group of 4 walked up and looked at the list the server quickly came out and asked them how many they said 4, he looked in and said I have a table! Mind you that these people were not told to wait or sign up on a board to wait. I asked him and said we have been waiting before them and he said yes but I have a table for 4. My issue is really a table for 4? What is the difference??? 3 people will go at a table like that as well. I felt disrespected at that point because we were looked over as we were not there. That isn&#39;t how you do business at all. I will not go back to this place nor recommend it to anyone. Needless to say we left and went to another place because of the actions of the poor staff here.

Pretty average dim sum. I expected SF to have better dim sum, and I heard Chinatown was pretty disappointing, so I headed all the way to the Castro. Not the biggest place (had to wait to seat 3), and parking was not the easiest to find--especially on those huge slopes!I thought the prices were very reasonable, until I realized $4 only got 3 potstickers! Oh well, that meant it was just averagely priced. My friends really liked the meat ball (I didn&#39;t), and the pork buns were probably my favorite. The zhong zi were great, and Shanghai soup dumplings, sesame balls, and potstickers were all solid, but nothing really stood out to be honest.The inside wasn&#39;t as dirty as I expected, obviously a plus. Relatively crowded. I would suggest coming here in twos if you come during peak hours (like weekend lunch) so you won&#39;t have to wait as long.

Probably some of the best sezchuan, chinese, dim sum food I have ever had. Dry fried chicken with green beans were out of this world, perfectly seasoned, green beans fresh with a nice crunch, chicken melted in your mouth. Shanghai dumplings, shumai, and beef chow fun were also amazing. And it was super busy and the service was still fast and attentive. Going back again today for dim sum. Not a fan of the pork and cabbage boiled dumplings, but probably just because it didn&#39;t shine compared to everything else.And so affordable compared to SF standards. Ordered all that and it was only 46 bucks.

One of the reason that this restaurant has become popular in the area is that there is no other good Chinese food in this neighborhood. We had tried this restaurants a few times. Every time when we went we tried different things. The food is really just ok.Often restaurant gets busy and the quality of food degrades significantly. Last time we were in the restaurant we ordered the snow pea pod ( peas leaves ). The stem of the pea leaves was so tough we had to spit out most part of this dish. (It&#39;s supposed to be tender and crisp at the same time.) We talked to the owner of the restaurant and she justified the dish was just fine because she had it for lunch.If you really know food, before you go you might need to curb your expectation. It is really not a 4 * rating like you seen on Yelp.

Don&#39;t order anything fried here, you get things soaked in oil. The steamed things were pretty good. Overall flavor was lacking (had to add shoyu to most of it) and the oiliness left us with much to desire. Service was horrible...there practical add none and food was just dumped on our table. And the restaurant wasn&#39;t even full.

A little gem of a restaurant on 18th street in the Castro district. We came here near closing and ordered two dishes:-Steamed fish with tofu in hunan chili sauce-Boiled beef slices in fiery sauceBoth were numbingly (quite literally) authentic and spicy! In general, szechuan food is spicy and on the greasy side but I would recommend coming here. it&#39;s definitely a delicious place to grab food but be prepared for the numbing kind of spicy!

It&#39;s hard for me to find decent dim sum in the Civic Center/Tenderloin area. Mama Ji&#39;s delivers (via Caviar). It&#39;s very authentic! Ha Gao was perfect, shiu mai was excellent and the lotus leaf sticky rice tasted homemade.

Food still gonna be good- i have no doubt about that.Rules: follow your order and presented reservation of having people either fall in line or putting their name on a list. Do not try to FUBAR a list by seating acquaintances or friends first. That&#39;ll piss me off (especially when you&#39;re not full to even 3/5 capacity.

Delicious!I came here with a couple friends after spending a few (very) happy hours at Badlands on Friday. Dimsum and spicy Chinese food isn&#39;t something I usually think of eating after having a couple drinks, but now that you can, it&#39;s fantastic! We ordered way too much food, but in so doing, got to try a number of dishes. We ordered the Shanghai dumplings, shrimp dumplings, Chongqing chicken, pickled long beans with pork, and spicy fish with tofu.Is the dim sum here among the best in the Bay Area? Uh no, duh. You&#39;re in the Castro- you just stumbled here from a bar. What do you think? Is it good, fairly authentic, and conveniently located in the Castro? You betcha.As far as the dishes were concerned, they were delicious. Most were salty, spicy, and tasty in the best possible way. But the Chongqing chicken really stood out- crispy and perfectly seasoned.The waiters weren&#39;t bad- patiently going through the menu with us, and attentively refilling our water glasses. I&#39;ll definitely be back!

Nice enough spot for a Szechuan meal by the Castro, although it seemed nearly half of the dishes on the menu were vegetarian (could be in your favor, but not so fitting for my carnivorous tendencies), and do be weary of which dishes are super-spicy (labeled on the menu with three chili icons).Already spicy with a single chili menu icon was an order of Shredded Pork with Garlic Sauce. Flavorful, but I am glad I had a beverage at my side. I also was eating family style with a group, but simply could not hold up very long with their order of Spicy Fish Fillets with Flaming Chili Oil! Do I need to point out how many chili icons that dish received?Our vegetable dish was much tamer: Stir-Fried Pea Sprouts with Garlic. So, for two out of three plates, I practically was well off.We did not come for dim sum, but it might be nice to try out for that.

Short version: the food was good, but the service was terrible.Went to dim sum on Sunday, they were not that crowded. Had about a 10 min wait when we got there. Seated at about 12:45. We give the server our order card and proceed to wait. After about 45 min of waiting we finally receive our first dish. We think &#34;maybe the kitchen is understaffed, things will pick up now that the place is emptying out.&#34; No such luck. We proceed to get one dish about every 15 to 20 minutes. Tables around us all got their food in one go. We even saw people get seated, order, and receive all of their food (some of which we had ordered and were still waiting on!) in the time it took for one dish to get to us. We asked what was going on, and the server gave no explanation. Finally after 2 hours of waiting and 4 plates our still-hungry party of 4 decided to leave and ask for the check. From there we had to argue with the server and get the dishes that we never received taken off the final bill. In all, a really unpleasant experience. With all of the excellent dim sum places available in the city, I will definitely not be coming to this one again.

We had the Pan Fried Pot Stickers for an appetizer. They were pretty good, but were helped by dashes of chili and soy sauces. We also had the Triple &#34;C&#34; Wings. They were also good, but the skin should have been a bit crispier. (Full disclosure: I&#39;m totally spoiled by the Angel Wings at Marnee Thai against which nothing has ever come close.)For our entrees, we had the Chongqing Chicken and the Dry Fried Beef with Green Beans. The chicken was crispy out the outside and juicy on the inside with just enough spice. The beef was tender, but, oddly, not dry (considering it&#39;s supposed to be from the name). The beans were average, however.

Funny place, not too assuming from the outside, and one can eat there, walk in, just a couple of tables taken, young waitress sees us and says &#39;Sit anywhere.&#39; We do, and take notice of the clever little plate. On the table is our menu, lots of good varieties of the usual, most well priced. Great selection of beers, esp Chimay.We order, more people come in, the take out counter near the register is busy, and then our food starts arriving. Every dish a winner, on a par with Yank Sing...Seems and looks new, the black/white/red scheme works, there just needs to be more red. Esp on the column and lintel.Very good service, our table was well managed and empty baskets were whisked promptly, partly due to it being a slow Monday lunch and not busy.Finally, in this part of town, great dim sum.Enjoy!

If you are hungry. If you like cocaine. This is the place to be. I swear, there is cocaine in their BBQ pork buns because they ARE SO GOOD!

What a difference a day makes! On Saturday night, the food was innovative and delicious. Both the fish fragrant pork and the seafood clay pot were excellent. I would have given them five stars. We returned on Monday night and ordered the Chongqing Chicken and &#34;ants climbing trees&#34;. The former was the same as a bad order of chicken McNuggets and the latter was a gooey mass of rice noodles with minced pork. Absolutely terrible! We learned later that the regular chefs were off that night and the &#34;backup&#34; chefs were cooking. Well if the hallmark of a good restaurant is consistently good food then this place deserves three stars at most. The list of Belgian beers on tap (which go well with Chinese food) is a plus but the schizophrenia in the kitchen makes this place a crap shoot.

Hate writing reviews like this. Cause on one hand, it&#39;s well-deserved kudos. But on the other, as soon as people figure out how great this place is, there will be an hour wait at all times of the day. So I&#39;ll keep this simple...I&#39;ve been to joints such as Yank Sing and Koi Palace here in the City, as well as Michelin-rated and others worldwide. Mama Ji&#39;s can hang with the best of them. If you want a reference point, just look up Tim Ho Wan in Hong Kong. Similar vibe.Thankfully MJ is tucked away in a quieter neighborhood, so that should keep the casual eaters away and get me a table quickly. For awhile, at least. If they could replicate the Tim Ho Wan BBQ bun (hint, hint), it would be game over for US dim sum fans. So good.

New in the neighborhood and heard high praise about MaMa Ji&#39;s - it was justified. As much as I loved the Qongjing Chicken (don&#39;t be afraid of the peppers, they&#39;re the best part), I think the most interesting part of my dinner experience was the Dim Sum. Super cheap and excellent portions and you should plan on splitting everything. It was just a wonderful variety of flavors.They also have an incredible Belgian Beer selection, although I didn&#39;t have any. Will definitely be back!

This is some of the best dim sum I&#39;ve ever had and very reasonably priced. Everything tastes so fresh and comes out steaming hot. You don&#39;t get the traditional dim sum experience of ladies walking around with carts that don&#39;t speak English but it&#39;s so good it doesn&#39;t matter. I would also say there&#39;s nothing particularly unique about the dumplings - pretty much all the traditional dumplings. But if you can do traditional really well, why mess with it?

I actually like this place. Dim sum selection is not great but my favorites are all here, especially the rice rolls( shrimp and pork). Shumai, pork dumplings, and the spare ribs are really good too! Surprisingly the taste is actually decent enough(like the ones i had in Asia). This place is also convenient because i live nearby, and i prefer going here rather the richmond or sunset.One thing though about this place is that, service does GET slow when the place is crowded. Ive been here when its empty and crowded, when its empty, the service is awesome! My water gets refilled and they always ask how the food is. However, when its crowded, service is so slow, that it takes 15 mins to get your bill to come to you! so beware of that or take it as a pre-warning when you go to mama-ji.Big groups are not always good cause the place is too small, so youd have to be careful with that.But anyways, id always go here when its less crowded. Dim sum in the castro! Pretty rare, eh i might say.

I have to echo Carol C&#39;s sentiments. The food has declined precipitously. The service has gotten to terrible territory. The table next to us ordered chive and chicken dumplings they got chive and shrimp and the waitress wouldn&#39;t take it off their bill. The waitress tried to argue that they are actually the same dish... Ridiculous. I used to love this place no idea what happened.

Nestled in a quiet residential neighborhood, MaMa Ji&#39;s serves up clean, quality Chinese (more specifically, Szechuan) cuisine. I&#39;ve had a good share of authentic Szechuan food and I believe MaMa Ji&#39;s borders more on Szechuan fusion, in a good way. Sometimes it&#39;s nice to get away from the yelling waiters running back and forth from the kitchen, which is a common scene in most authentic Chinese establishments. The entrees can be shared or enjoyed individually.I got the Noodles with Chili Bean Paste ($8.75). For some reason, I was expecting a noodle soup, but this is literally cooked noodles with a thick layer of sauce on top. It also came with a lot more vegetables (peas and carrots) than I envisioned. The sauce is not too spicy and makes the dish a comforting, non-oily dinner option.My friend got the Fish Fragrant Eggplant ($9.95), which is actually vegetarian (they just use the same sauces that would traditionally be paired with fish I believe). It was a bit spicy, but quite delicious, and I was jealous.There were many local, almost-next-door couples and individuals dining here; the table next to us said this was their favorite go-to dinner spot. I loved that the food wasn&#39;t overloaded with salt, MSG, and oil, as Chinese food usually goes.

Went there for lunch. Really don&#39;t know what&#39;s the big deal about this place. Just an average dimsum place with rundown enviornment. The selection is very little. The skin for shrimp dumplings is way too thick. Being from Vancouver, I&#39;ve experienced way better dimsum.Maybe it is pretty good for SF standard but if you are from south bay or Vancouver or anywhere that have decent asian population, you are not missing out.

Naturally coming to San Francisco we were looking for a great little dim sum shop and I was excited when I heard about Mama Ji&#39;s on Yelp. Overall, it wasn&#39;t a terrible experience, it just lacked in a few really important areas.It took awhile to get a table on a Saturday afternoon, which is normal for a place like this, but took even longer just for the waitress to take our order. We had probably been seated 15-20 minutes before we even were asked if we wanted drinks, and then another 10-15 or so before she took our food order. After that it was downhill. It took over an hour for us to finally get all our food and eat, we were actually quite full when the manger (I assume, since she showed up later) came and asked if we had everything and we just asked for our check - she ran back, grabbed the 3-4 items we had received yet and brought them to the table. Just a really poor experience on a really busy day, I&#39;m hopeful this isn&#39;t normal for them.In terms of food, it was actually quite good. The pork buns were great and we loved the spicy chili noodles. Excellent dish. The low score is more for the poor service than anything, they seemed to be way, way understaffed. I&#39;d definitely like to go back and see if the service is any better.

The food overall tastes ok; we had beef chow fun, fried rice, and crispy eggplant... But I almost ate a piece of plastic (film, probably from some packaging) that was in the beef chow fun. At first I thought it was a piece of shrimp shell (there was no shrimp in that dish) but I was mortified when I realized it was a piece of plastic! I notified the server about it and all I got was an apology. No discount on the bill or anything comped. You can bet your ass we didn&#39;t leave a tip. Horrible service that left me hugely disappointed. Never coming back again!

I had written a tip/review about this place a year ago. It had just opened (I think I was there within the first week of opening). At the time, I thought the food was fantastic and even said it was the best Dim Sum I had ever had.However, I went there again recently and was underwhelmed. The service was awful and the dim sum tasted mediocre. I am not sure what happened but I wish i had the same experience as my initial visit. The dim sum is not bad, it just didn&#39;t have the freshness that I had tasted the first time I was there, and the wait staff was unattentive and different from before.

It is very seldom that I go to a new restaurant on the first day that it opens. Usually, there are many things that they are still trying to get right including the food. However, since my partner and I had been to Queen Malika before the renovation to change it over to MaMa Ji&#39;s and had tried the Dim Sum and had a great experience then, we decided to come and show support for the new incarnation as MaMa Ji&#39;s.What we were not prepared for was the fact that with the new renovation comes a new head chef directly from Yang Sing (known as one of the top Dim Sum restaurants in San Francisco). The chef makes all his own sauces from scratch and has a NO MSG policy. The food was top notch, from the amazing Seafood Shumai, to the delicious Steamed B.B.Q. Pork Bun, and the Chive Shrimp Dumplings. However, if I had to pick only one Dim Sum as #1, I would say that the Steamed Egg Custard Bun is probably the best I have ever tasted -- including several trips that I have taken to Hong Kong!There were a few Dim Sum that one could not yet order as I guess they were not yet ready for prime time -- but we will definitely be back to try them soon.They serve four types of Chinese teas directly from Taiwan and each one is served with it&#39;s own small teapot -- so that everyone at the table can order what they want and get unlimited refills of hot water.The other exciting thing about MaMa Ji&#39;s is that at night they will be open to serve Szechuan cuisine -- if the food is anything close to the Dim Sum, which I&#39;m sure it will be, it will be very exciting to have a great Chinese dinner place in the Castro.If you love Dim Sum as much as I do and want a local neighborhood setting, then you should definitely try MaMa Ji&#39;s!

I really enjoyed the Dim Sum I had at MaMa Ji&#39;s! The experience is not quite as authentic as a meal in somewhere like Chinatown and the selection is not nearly as diverse, but the food is incredible. We had the bell peppers with shrimp, Shanghai dumplings, shrimp dumplings, and pork buns, all of which were delicious. Our neighbors had more traditional entrees which looked incredible as well.If you are looking for a lot of inexpensive Dim Sum, this is probably not the right restaurant, but if you are looking for quality Chinese cuisine, I would definitely recommend MaMa Ji&#39;s.

I&#39;m very happy to have discovered this. The best Dim Sum outside of the Inner Richmond. Very accessible off the 33 and a short walk from Castro station. Extremely fair prices for the quality.Not particularly fast paced but I like that. Relax in a more quiet part of the city, enjoy your tea, and have a few bites to eat.I have not been here for dinner yet but I am confident it is delicious.

From the reviews I had high hopes for my mid-afternoon snack, but dry fried beef was too greasy, batter-y, and had too much msg. The sesame balls were decent, but too greasy as well. The tea was ok (a tad expensive,) and I was not convinced that the tea pot was very clean. Service was good, but her hair was tied up really loose, and I kept feeling paranoid that she would shed hair into my dish.Not sure what others saw in here, but I was unimpressed.

Been here a few times now, and it&#39;s definitely one of my favorites in the area. It does commonly get busy, so there can be a wait, and while the prices aren&#39;t bad, it&#39;s not cheap either. Portions are reasonable overall. Service is also okay, but not great. I sometimes have to ask multiple times for something before getting it. But regardless, the food is great, so I&#39;ll keep coming back. Many like it for the dim sum, but I&#39;m all about the dinner food.This most recent visit was a Friday night around 7:30pm. Fairly full inside, with another 5-7 parties waiting outside. Happened to slide in at just the right time to get a table for 2 with no wait. Though there were a couple more right after me who had to wait. Turnover does seem pretty good overall though, from what I&#39;ve observed.Shared a few items between 2 of us:- Fish with Chiles and Sichuan Pepper: this is an absolute staple for me, and I&#39;ve had it 3-4 times now. It&#39;s roughly a fish soup with a very oily and spicy chili-based broth, with white fish, mung beans, and cabbage. This is one of my favorite incarnations of the soup, after having had it 4-5 places total. Though after having it this most recent time, I do have to concede that there&#39;s not that much fish in there, and overall the portion is fairly small compared to that at Chef Zhao&#39;s, another I had recently, for a comparable price ($2-3 difference). Still, it&#39;s damn good and not something I think I&#39;ll skip anytime soon.- Mama Ji&#39;s country-style shrimp: tried this for the first time. a mix of shrimp (maybe 10-15), bell peppers, and green onions. A little spicy too. Loved the veggies, and the flavor of the dish on the whole, but would have liked more shrimp, and this is coming from a veggie-lover.- Stir-Fried Pea Leaves with Garlic: Another relative staple for me. This comes out something like a cross between stir-fried spinach and broccoli rabe, but more on the spinach side of flavor, being a bit lighter. Delicious, and I personally loved putting it in the broth from the fish with chiles, letting it soak that in a bit.- Chinese Broccoli with Garlic: Something I&#39;ve had less here, but still quite good. Not a lot to say about it, but a good serving size of the Chinese broccoli. Came out nicely cooked so that it still had the firmness to it but was a little soft.Overall, came to about $50 with tip I think. And another wonderful visit. I&#39;ll definitely be back.

If you like spicy Chinese food that&#39;s well prepared and fresh, then this is the place for you.The restaurant can get overwhelmingly loud on Friday and Saturday nights but what good restaurant isn&#39;t?

Dim Sum in the Castro: not a promising header. But this place is fantastic! It&#39;s not Koi Palace (in flavor and price), but it is extraordinarily good dim sum for the city. Up there with HK Lounge and other Richmond joints.We had the Har Gow (perfectly chewy, good snap to them, great flavor), the shrimp and pea sprout dumplings (very fresh, perfectly cooked), the shrimp-stuffed eggplant (great flavor, not too greasy), the shrimp rice roll (hand-pulled, great filling, soy was a little on the sweet side for my taste) and the XLB / shanghai dumpling. The only one that wasn&#39;t fantastic was the XLB (not a ton of soup inside, and made in the little tin cups which is usually a signal of a less delicate wrapper - accurate in this case), and even that was pretty good.I will absolutely be back!

Out came the red, chilled like a white. What?Tried the chicken wings and they are very sweet, maybe a plum sauce glaze. Duck egg pumpkin strips are more tempura than duck egg, try Hakka on clement in the richmond for an authentic version.Definitely did not feel the schezuan vibe, nothing was particularly spicy though we asked for it to be so. The chili oil on the table is oily, not spicy or hot, really a bit seedy and tired.Ok, so what was good? The vegetables in the food were fresh and well prepared, crispy yet tender. Same for the shrimp, perfectly cooked. The garlic pea shoots were a star, tasty, silky, and a bit off the beaten taste path.Kids are welcome, a pair were doing homework while awaiting their chow mein.Restaurant is clean, comfortable, well priced items and friendly. Just don&#39;t expect schezuan food, i tried and didn&#39;t find any. Parking is plentiful on the street outside. Definitely a neighborhood restaurant, welcoming and reliable.

WARNING: DO NOT ORDER FOOD FOR PICK UP FROM HERE. It&#39;s not worth the risk of showing up and learning that your order has somehow disappeared.I will never, EVER eat here again. Because I&#39;m so pissed about the service. I&#39;ve eaten at the restaurant multiple times, and the service is always lacking and slow (we always wait too long for the check, for example) - but I usually excuse bad service when the food is good enough to keep coming back (which for the most part it is, if you&#39;re okay with overpriced dim sum and Szechuan food). BUT I&#39;m finally done with Mama Ji&#39;s and am admitting to myself that it is a poorly run business that does NOT deserve my patronage.I called in an order for pick up; gave my order, gave my name and phone number, etc. The woman who answered (I&#39;m guessing the owner, who I notice is the one usually picking up the phone when I eat in) gave me a 35-minute estimate. We show up at the restaurant 35 minutes later only to find out that our order DOES NOT EXIST. They had no record of it. Not that they forgot to put the order in to the kitchen - they literally just misplaced our order and apparently don&#39;t have my name and order written down anywhere. They even questioned if we called in at all. WELL, WE DID. They said we could order again, and they could have the food ready in 10 minutes (which I doubt was actually possible), but by then, we were pissed. Dinner plans ruined; we drove all the way there for no reason, etc. They really did not care about retaining our business.It was a busy night, and I get that they&#39;re tending to a lot of customers. But HI, YOU&#39;RE A RESTAURANT. You can&#39;t just lose people&#39;s orders.Goodbye forever, Mama Ji&#39;s! Ugh.

Awesome place! I think this is a really easygoing and delicious spot for lunch. They have several menu items which are $4-5 which makes it easy to order several! On a Thursday at lunchtime it was only filled with a few other groups, so it was a nice place to relax. Was craving dumplings and didn&#39;t want to go all the way to the Sunset! Soo delicious.

A very cute little Chinese restaurant in the outer end of Castro.We had the lotus lead wrapped rice, shanghai dumplings and BBQ flat rice noodle rolls (I forgot the name). All were excellent, especially the latter dish with very flavorful pork.We also ordered the spicy boiled fish dish, but found that to be ok compared to standouts like Da Sichuan in Palo Alto.Overall, I day I would definitely return for the dum sum, but perhaps not the Sichuan stuff.

Okay, this place is fantastic. Hooray for some great food in the Castro! And some of the best Chinese food I&#39;ve had in the city. I totally stand by that.Both the dim sum and the wok-fried entrees were excellent. And dim sum for dinner! I don&#39;t know why this isn&#39;t more common. Why wouldn&#39;t I want that? Why wouldn&#39;t ANYONE want that?We got the pork buns, fried turnip, seafood shumai, and shanghai dumplings to start. Everything was a cut above what I was expecting, except the shanghai dumplings, which were not as delicate as the best ones are. Still tasty. We got a beef with green beans entree, and it, too, was better than I was expecting.The desserts are amazing. The egg custard lava bun might be my new favorite thing, and the black-bean-filled sesame balls were rich and delicious.

Really enjoyed the service and atmosphere of this neighborhood restaurant in Eureka Valley. Servers are attentive, friendly and welcoming. Dumpling&#39;s filing is excellent but thought the wrap was a bit doughy. Ants on tree, a minced pork on silver glass noodles is delicious. Tried chili pepper fish and tofu, like the dish but my wife didn&#39;t like the soft texture of the fish. I think the restaurant is a great additional to the neighborhood and we will be back.

Really, really good Szechuan food. The numbing fish was wonderful: well-spiced and flavorful without being egregiously spicy, and the country style shrimp was delicious, with wonderful chili oil on the vegetables.It was actually the dim sum that was the least exciting -- really good, but not as flavorful as the actual dishes. Will absolutely be back, though, can&#39;t wait to taste more.

The food here is decent, not amazing, but definitely not terrible. The problem is the service. We&#39;ve been to Mama Ji&#39;s almost every time we&#39;ve traveled to SF, and each time the food takes forever. On our most recent visit (yesterday), our party of four waited for each dish separately - had we waited until everyone had their food, some dishes would have been sitting on the table for 15-20 minutes. The waiters are all super friendly, and the vibe of the place is great, but just be ready to eat when each dish comes out.

One of the best places for Chinese food in downtown SF! This is my go-to spot for comfort Chinese food around Castro and Mission districts.MaMa Ji&#39;s food features Dim-Sum for lunch, and Szechuan food for dinner. You won&#39;t find stuff like Orange Chicken, or General Tso&#39;s Chicken here. Instead, you will find authentic Sichuan food there. How many &#34;Szechuan&#34; restaurants offer MaPo Toufu? Not so many. And among those, how many would actually call it &#34;Madam Chen&#39;s MaPo Tofu&#34; (how this dish is called in Sichuan)? None but MaMa Ji&#39;s.I came here for dinner one day being extremely hungry as I skipped lunch on that day. I was planning to get some noodles or so, until I saw their special of the day &#34;Braised Chicken with Chestnuts&#34;. I have never had that dish anywhere outside of home kitchens. I know I had no choice but to try that. It did not disappoint me at all. The rich flavors of chicken, shitake mushrooms and chestnuts remind of home and my mom&#39;s kitchen. I ordered some shrimp and chive dumplings too and they were so fresh and delicious. I can&#39;t wait for the next time to go back and try some other dishes!

5 stars -- &#34;as good as it gets&#34; even, in my experience, compared to dim sum in Guangzhou and HK. The flavors and textures are perfect. Xiao long bao (Shanghai dumplings) and nai huang bao (custard buns) are astonishingly fresh and tasty. A trendy dining space, option of outdoor seating and extensive [Belgian] beer list may not be authentic features, but they should be.

Not bad food, but not great. The wonton soup was pretty good, but the shrimp and chicken shumai were pretty dry. We had appetizers so I can&#39;t really speak to the more adventurous dishes. I&#39;d be willing to try it again just to make sure I didn&#39;t miss something special.Sake was good at least! They served it in a square cup which was pretty funny. My not-so-quick friend didn&#39;t realize you&#39;re supposed to drink out of the corners so he spilled all over himself. It might be worth going just for that.

Wow! So impressed with this place and likely would have never found it if it had not been for my sister - kinda deep into the Castro and I&#39;m still new to the city.It&#39;s a dim sum/home style Chinese spot yet when you walk in you get this cool rustic vibe at the same time. I like that it manages to do that! I didn&#39;t get much of a choice on what we ordered bc I was so late but they all picked well.We had the veggie chow mein which was so good! It didn&#39;t feel overly greasy but still a heavier dish packed with flavor. The veggie spring rolls soaked were so good they were wrapped in flat egg noddles and I bet with meat tastes even better!We ordered some spicy chicken digs that was mixed with bell pepper, onions and such and it was so delicious! I bet all their home style dishes are amazing. We also had pot stickers and soup dumplings all delish. We stuck to shrimp and chicken although I would love to go back and try the beef!I would definitely go again! Also had a good selection of bottles beers and wine. The bill was so cheap for 4 of us to eat and it was so much food - def a heavier meal I wouldn&#39;t have often but as a treat. Good to dine in groups family style to try things.

We came here expecting a wait (like most dim sum places on a Sunday) and were told it would be 30 mins for a table for 2. It was actually more like 10 minutes which was awesome!We ordered about 8 different dishes and it was a bit too much food for us but it was nice to have some for lunch today. My boyfriend&#39;s favorite was the rice in the leaf and the pork shumai. My favorite was the cilantro shrimp dumplings. The service was great and the food was good. Only complaint was that one of the dishes (I unfortunately can&#39;t remember what it was called now) that was just meat had a TON of bones and fat in it, so most pieces were inedible. However the ones that were edible tasted awesome.

It&#39;s in the neighborhood, and my coworker claimed that their chicken wing is better than San Tung(which is impossible btw). But I had to try it.Obviously, their fried chicken wing is not better than San Tung. It was good, and had interesting spice. It&#39;s just not that crispy. Onion cake was awful, don&#39;t get it. It was tasteless thick greasy fried flour dough. It was wasting of ingredients and my 6 dollars. But but but their wanton soup is amazing! Clean broth, delicious wanton. I will definitely come back for this again.I was checking out other table, and everything looks quite delicious. I have to come back to try more, but definitely not onion cake.This place is serious about selling drinks. I don&#39;t drink alcohol at all. I see some people complaint about they charge tea for $3. I think they are not handing out complimentary tea, so more people would get beer.

My boyfriend and I use to live at nob hill (close to Chinatown). And when we moved to duboce triangle, we were devastated at how far we were from any good dim sum. Luckily we found this place!They have good dim sum selection including some very well made xiaolongbao. The Sichuan dishes are amazing as well. And you can wash it all down with some Belgium beer!The place is clean and well maintained. Service is great and with a smile. The owners are a very sweet local couple who seem to really love what they do.

I really like the mom and pop feeling of this restaurant, unlike a lot of big dim sum restaurants, it feels like a cozy neighborhood restaurant. The shrimp roll was nice and soft with good amount of shrimp. You can definitely taste the home made style of the food. Wait can be long. Even for a weekday lunch. Price wise it&#39;s higher than your typical dim sum place but not as much as Yank Sing. I&#39;m ok with that as long as the quality is good.

HOW DO YOU NOT HAVE FREE TEA!? THIS IS A DIM SUM RESTAURANT.Rant aside, I was scrambling to find a good dim sum restaurant to take a coworker who on the scale of 1-10 in whiteness, a solid 7. And a quick search turned up Mama Ji&#39;s. I rolled up on a Sunday morning with an intense hangover at 10am and was quickly seated. This is like a weird Americanized dim sum brunch place. Highlights include: the rice roll wrappers, har gow, char siu bao and stuffed eggplant with shrimp. And the meal came out to be $40 for 3 with tip, so while it&#39;s a little pricier than typical dim sum, it&#39;s about average for brunch in the city.I would recommend coming here if this is your first foray into dim sum and would like a nice Americanized introduction with a little handholding. But if you want an actual dim sum restaurant, look elsewhere. It&#39;s seriously a tragedy when there&#39;s no chicken feet, congee, or free tea.

We came here on a Sunday upon finding our old standby Chinese place closed. Took a chance on something new. MaMa Ji&#39;s is clean and quaint. The service was a little slow however, and there was a definite language barrier. Made ordering a bit difficult, but we managed. In my opinion the best part about MaMa Ji&#39;s are the steamed dumplings. I ordered the shrimp and cilantro, and they were excellent. Delicate dough. Perfect shrimp. Next came the house special clay pot, which was a mix of everything. I found it a little over-seasoned for my tastes. Too much salt. Thick sauce. I didn&#39;t care much for it. Overall, if I was in the neighborhood, I would come back for the dumplings, but it would not be a place where I&#39;d go out of my way for.

SOSPICYZOMGSO. SPICY. If like me you have a spice tolerance that never seems to increase, beware! Between gasps things were quite tasty though... I think. I was mostly relying on what my significant other claimed to be true. We got the pork shumai, which was traditionally my favorite dim sum dish growing up. It did not disappointment, though was it any better than any other good dim sum? More expensive for sure..But unique for the neighborhood I guess. We also got the boiled beef slices and the ma po tofu, both of which induced streams of sweat through the rest of dinner. But the ingredients seemed fresh and healthy, and really, they did taste quite good. I&#39;d come back! Though maybe I&#39;d be inclined to order more of the dim sum next time. Oh yeah also, it&#39;s a small place and gets pretty loud when full.

Good dim sum! We ordered the BBQ pork buns, pork pot stickers, small pork soup dumplings, chicken wonton soup, spare ribs and bran curd dumplings. Everything was fantastic except for the bean curd dumplings, which we sent back. The service is great, they also have exceptional coffee, espresso and tea options.This is the kind of dim sum place where you order on a sheet of paper (no ladies with carts). The facility is very clean, it&#39;s well decorated and it&#39;s in a fun neighborhood. I do wish that there were more vegetable options for lunch. Usually dim sum places offer plates of Chinese broccoli or bok choy, but this was not the case here. Other Yelp posters have included pictures of their vegetable sides, perhaps those are dinner features. That being said, the dumplings are truly exceptional - try it out!

The fish in chili oil dish we ordered was fantastic, whereas the dumplings we ordered were not bad, but not great either.The lady somehow figured out I spoke Mandarin, and proceeded to call me, not &#34;handsome&#34; or &#34;good-looking&#34;, but &#34;pretty&#34;.

The pork and seafood shumai were my favorite.My only con is the plate of fried rice wasn&#39;t anything special and it came out last after all the other dishes had been served. For being priced at around $10, I was a little disappointed at the smaller size of the dish and that it only consisted of peas, carrots, and bits of egg. Not worth it, but still good enough to eat.

It&#39;s amazing how different things can look in a couple blocks in the city. Mama Ji&#39;s is located in the heart of Castro, yet somehow this block does feel a bit quiet and homey.The food here is great! I recommend any of the dim sum, cold noodles, and fried chicken. The cold noodles come in a hot chili oil platter with cucumbers and ground pork. It&#39;s like a savory and spicy noodle salad. The fried chicken here is spicy, crispy, and delicious. It feels like a whiff of peppery smoke releases into the air with each bite. The one thing I like most about Mama Ji&#39;s is that it&#39;s a really nice looking restaurant. It&#39;s simple, clean, but yet kinda hip and charming. It kinda reminds me of a hamburger diner or pancake house. I would love to come back and try all the dinner options. Just need to practice my chopstick skills beforehand.

&#39;twas a sunny Sunday in Eureka Valley when I walked over to MaMa Jis for brunch.I looked over at the crowd and thought &#39;crap, this is going to be a long wait&#39;.However, even though this is just their second week as a full service restaurant, they&#39;re starting to hit their stride.Dim sums (?) came out one by one, only a couple of minutes apart. Each one was fresh, delicious, and piping hot. By the time the last dish was on the table, we were lagging behind.Both the owners (husband and wife) dropped by to check in on us and were super friendly. It seems they&#39;ve always wanted to open up a restaurant in this neighborhood that served really good Chinese food. Right now their main focus is picking up great ingredients and making sure that everything that makes it out to each table is of high quality.I think they&#39;ve nailed it. Looking forward to trying them for dinner.

Dim Sum is quite good. Dumplings are served hot and flavourful and the staff is rather friendly. The menu is short, however they do what&#39;s available very well. It&#39;s a small place, only seating a max of 49 and I&#39;m not sure how they&#39;d fit that many. I would recommend this place if you&#39;re looking for a nice neighbourhood style meal away from the banquet hall Dim Sum places.

Okay, this probably isn&#39;t a restaurant intended for vegetarians to like but I am going to review it anyway. Because it is just one more shitty restaurant in the Castro.I ordered a few dishes. I got the fried pumpkin with duck egg, kung pao tofu and some veggie buns. I was expecting the veggie buns to be what they were but the pumpkin could have been amazing. It was gross. Imagine the worst, flavorless, fried-something you ever had...it was like that. Just a heaping pile of flavorless fried food.The kung pao was ok. Ok in the sense that if my friends dragged me there and I got that I wouldn&#39;t bitch too much.The service was a lot like the food, mediocre.

I suspect that MaMa Ji&#39;s high rating so far has to do with subconsciously lowered expectations since it&#39;s 3-4 blocks, and a couple dozen storefronts, uphill from Castro &amp; 18th. For whatever reason, larger restaurants on Market with better food have been slammed on Yelp and run off in less than a year.For my first and only visit so far, just a takeout order of three dim sum was enough after having a couple drinks nearby. Tucked into unassuming decor were small tables of smiling people. A good sign, I thought.The mushrooms in the shrimp stuffed mushrooms were large, which helped them remain crisp and juicy after cooking. The pork shumai were fine. The Shanghai dumplings, with broth, were served on individual tiny aluminum plates and interesting. FWIW, I&#39;ve eaten these in Taipei, Taiwan, but never in Shanghai, China.While the two employees who spoke to me were very friendly, the speed of food didn&#39;t match. It&#39;s a data point of only one, but...takeout at 9pm on a Thursday, and dim sum only to reduce the wait time, shouldn&#39;t take 15-20 minutes, should it? I heard &#34;10 minutes,&#34; and then a quiet, &#34;Maybe 15,&#34; and thought to myself: &#34;Self, what the heck did you just order? Why didn&#39;t you just stay on Castro St?&#34;Too late. Catching my bus, and the alternate, both were off the list by that point. Admittedly, I&#39;d become impatient and it felt like taxi time. Oh well, maybe I&#39;ll be back. Or maybe I&#39;ll get my dim sum fix elsewhere.

We decided to brunch here the sunday we spent up in SF. It&#39;s a tiny restaurant situated right in the Castro, and it was really cute!Service was fast, we were running late for an appointment and we were able to get in and out. Food came so quickly!Im a dim sum noob but my boyfriend is a seasoned veteran and ordered for us. We got the spicy cold noodles, bbq pork buns, soup dumplings, the pea sprout shrimp dumplings, and the sesame dessert buns.Spicy cold noodles: SO AMAZING. I inhaled this. My boyfriend seemed surprised as how peanutty it was but it was divine. I secretly wish they were warm, but when I said that&#39;s partner looked at me as if I said something blasphemous.Bbq pork buns: I was not impressed. I&#39;ve had these homemade for me before, and in my humble opinion they were much better at home. These buns were entirely too sweet (much more than I tasted in the homemade ones) and it threw me off. Also, there was so little meat inside them that I couldn&#39;t really taste it.Pea sprout dumplings: delicious!! Big pieces of shrimp and good flavor.Soup dumplings: not too much soup in them but good flavor. They brought the ginger and mixed it all up with the vinegar, which is apparently the traditional way to eat them. Super yummy!Sesame buns (dessert): very yummy. Super crispy outside, complimented by the lightly sweet red bean paste on the inside.All in all, a good dim sum brunch experience. We got in and out quickly, food was good, and the whole bill without tip was $27. And I walked out of there stuffed with a doggy bag.

It&#39;s a pretty long wait for okay dim, but a solid place nevertheless. Don&#39;t go here hungry, because:1) You have to wait a bit before getting a table and the restaurant doesn&#39;t take reservations.2) Once you&#39;ve ordered, the food immediately comes out, but it comes out piping hot so you&#39;ll burn yourself if you don&#39;t wait long enough. If you wait for the steam to die down a little, and you think you&#39;ve waited long enough, give it a little more time because you&#39;re just going to burn your mouth again.I was pretty excited to see that they serve Ritual coffee, and while it&#39;s unlimited refills, the coffee was somewhat watery.The dried bean curd skin roll and sweet rice with shrimp wrapped in lotus leaf were probably my favorite. The pork shumai was better than the shrimp shumai.

Fresh, FRESH,and tasty Chinese served up with friendly service. OMG, some of the best Kung Pao Prawns I&#39;ve eaten in San Francisco: fat, juicy and tender shrimp cooked to perfection, mixed up with crisp bell peppers and large and crunchy peanuts, enrobed in a tangy spicy sauce liberally laced with crushed Szechuan peppers.I&#39;ve been eagerly awaiting the opening after its renovations turned the place from a Dim Sum and crepe cafe to a full fledged restaurant adding traditional Chinese fare. There is still work to be done: the walls are bereft of any adornment, and the wait staff are still getting familiar with the variety of dishes, but the meal does not disappoint, au contraire.

Pretty legit dim sum place in the Castro. I think they may have just opened up? It&#39;s not organized well, and there are random items thrown about like in the restroom. It&#39;s got a hole in the wall feel but looks nicer than that. The various dim sum items we ordered were up to par with our favorite dim sum places, if just a little below in taste. BBq pork steam bun, fried eggplant with shrimp, tofu with shrimp, deep fried meat dumplings, noodles. We didn&#39;t order entrees just dim sum. We&#39;ll go again if in the neighborhood.

My gf and I have visited Mama Ji&#39;s twice in the last month, both times for dim sum brunch. The food has been consistently excellent. The spicy cold noodles are a highlight and the dumplings are varied and delicious.Our only complaint is that the restaurant has been short-staffed at 10am on Sunday both times. Today, they couldn&#39;t make espresso until Mama Ji herself showed up. So, why open at 930 if you can&#39;t provide good service? Other than this, we heartily recommend this great new dim sum spot!

I heard about this place for great dim sum, but the dinner menu looked much better.When we went, we had the chongqing chicken, numbing fish, pickled long beans, pumpkin with duck egg coating, and the flowing lava buns. Two servings of brown rice was too much rice for us- one would have been better. Everything was great- lots of Szechuan pepper in the chicken, fish, and green bean dishes (maybe a little bit too much?) We preferred the chicken to the fish dish. iI was *so good* when we&#39;d get a small piece of ginger that had been fried up with the chicken- a nice, bright and clean counterpoint taste to the vinegar and numbing pepper. Those few ginger pieces seemed accidently and we wanted more of them. Unlike dry fried green beans, the pickled long beans were diced into small pieces, which soaked up more sauce and spice. Since all theses dishes were heavy on the Szechuan pepper, it was a little too much of that numbing effect to have all of these in one meal. The pumpkin was our favorite- because it&#39;s so good and also because it was a little sweet and totally different from the other things we ordered. The duck egg yolk coating was not quite as powdery as I&#39;ve had elsewhere and was really nice with a salty dusting on outer surface. The lava buns had a firm center, not the flowing custard that we expected, and that was disappointing. Overall, great food.The service was... &#34;serviceable.&#34; Fast enough though not super attentive, nor particularly friendly, which is preferable to forced/faked friendliness. As someone else said, the dining room was very warm on a cool night. You might be more comfortable if you wear removable layers or leave your sweaters at home. The night we went, the crowd wasn&#39;t very lively. Since it&#39;s small in there, every time my husband made me laugh we drew glances from the other, quieter diners.My husband asked about bringing my Chinese dad for dinner, but I&#39;m pretty sure he wouldn&#39;t be into it. For the type of food it is, it&#39;s much more expensive than the places he would frequent. And, to be blunt, there weren&#39;t a lot of Asian people eating here. This is very good Americanized Chinese food. It has better flavor and better preparation that your typical &#34;take out Chinese,&#34; but that&#39;s the general category I&#39;d place this restaurant in. Well prepared, tasty, and &#34;safe&#34; or easy Chinese food, using only the parts of that chicken that were used to eating in the US. Though I&#39;m not planning on bringing my dad, we&#39;ll go back for sure.

Not your typical Dim Sum spot but definitely sumthing delicious!We showed up here on a sunday around 11... without any call ahead of time and asked to be seated with 9 people. This is a small restaurant, something I didnt realize ahead of time. They didn&#39;t hesitate, they said we will see what we can do! They asked if we would be willing to split the table, which was fine, given the situation. Instead, it was a beautiful day so they brought out tables on the sidewalk (where they generally only have one on each side of the door) to accommodate us.Now, when I say its not your typical dim sum spot, I mean that I am used to carts coming around and you just pick what you want from the carts as they come around. This place they give you a paper menu and you mark how many of each item you would like (which can be a bit more difficult if you dont know what your doing). I&#39;m pretty confident you cant go wrong. The food was great!It&#39;s definitely worth a try if you&#39;re in the neighborhood and looking to fill yourself to the point of being rolled home in a wheelbarrow!

Review based on seating experience only. We went elsewhere.As a former server, I&#39;m a pretty patient and understanding restaurant customer. But I still have some minimum expectations.One of those expectations is to not be left outside in the rain, along with two other parties of two, because the only empty tables are four-tops.After staring at one such empty table for ten minutes through the window, the two-top squeezed into the kitchen entrance (your standard afterthought table) vacated and was offered to us. We inquired about what was wrong with the more suitably located empty table, and were told it was for four (really?). When I pointed out that a party of four had been seated at a pair of pushed together two-tops, I got a condescending &#34;Young man...&#34; from the host (perhaps the co-owner, though I&#39;m not sure). Clearly this was not a matter of seating rigidity, but rather of greed.Very disappointing, as I really wanted to try some of the vegetarian dishes. We instead enjoyed a less exciting dinner around the corner that was entirely free of BS.Learn how to run a hospitable restaurant. Give seats to the customers you have, and not the ones you just might. Unreal.

Let&#39;s face it gays, the Castro is starved for affordable, GOOD food. Most of our fare caters to the happy hour crowd which I happily partake in but because I&#39;m not drunk 24/7 Mama Ji&#39;s is a happy addition to the neighborhood. Oh, and it&#39;s literally a hop skip and a jump from my house which makes it even better. I can literally hear the dishes crashing from my bedroom window. Yet I just smile because this restaurant is so feel good, so not pretentious b.s. San Francisco. It is just good food, good friendly people and good atmosphere. My partner and I usually go for dinner and have never been disappointed. It&#39;s the freshest tasting Chinese food I&#39;ve ever had, period.Try it. Your colon might regret the visit (some of the dishes are SPICY) but while you&#39;re there you&#39;ll feel warm, happy and full. Also, try the Belgian beer on tap. Great pairing with the food!

I walked here today with my son to meet my husband for dinner. We arrived at 5:32 and the restaurant was empty except for one couple. I asked if we could be seated and she asked how many we were and I told her three and my husband is on his way from the Church Street station. the hostess said that I can&#39;t seat you until the three of you are here. I asked her if this is the policy even though the restaurant is empty and he is on his biking here now from the muni station. She said those were the rules and indicated I should wait outside. It&#39;s 5:35 and the restaurant is still empty. I am used to this policy if a) restaurants are holding for reservations or b) the place is even half full. but it was empty and she even said, I have tables for you when you are all here. There are indeed many tables in many other restaurants in San Francisco.

Every time I go the owner Marv just brings me what ever he wants and it never misses. Always amazing always different. This is real szchewan home cooking. The quality and freshness is tasted in every spoonful. Forget Chinatown when you come to San Fran, go to this little place in the Castro district and you won&#39;t be sorry. It&#39;s a very small place so expect to wait on the weekend.

Just Mediocre. This place gets busy at lunch time, but I think a lot of that owes being ever-so slightly off the beaten path of the trendy part of Castro. Their Dim Sum is decent. I especially like anything with pork, though I recommend against which ever one comes wrapped in rice noodle, as it just can&#39;t seem to hold together. The sweet/sour pork buns are also a decent choice. Though the quality of the food is goos, the environment and the service come up a bit shabby. There&#39;s constantly a draft chilling both you and your food, and the staff tend to ignore your table. We had to flag our waiter down to order, to order again, and finally to ask for the check. That&#39;s 3 too many times. They also had to return to our table to confirm what we got to drink.

5 stars for the food. 3 stars for the surly attitude at the take out counter.Two friends of ours ate here earlier in the weekend and said it was the best dim sum they&#39;d had in a long time - saying they finally can get good dim sum without driving from Castro to the Richmond district. We ordered take out, the sweet and sour pork was crispy and sweet, without being greasy or cloying. The shrimp Shu mi (sp?) had a nice texture suggesting fresh seafood was used. We&#39;ll definitely get food from here again.As for the service, well, apparently one of the online websites posted a menu that doesn&#39;t belong to Mama Ji&#39;s. The man who took our order literally said, &#34;if you are looking at an online menu, I cannot help you.&#34; He then re-admonished me when I picked up the food for using a non approved menu. WTF? I just want to pay you money for some Chinese food. I don&#39;t have anything to do with your website problems!

My date and I also shared the shrimp dumplings and the pork shumai. Both were excellent. I tried some of my dates dish- mothers bean curd with pork. Also, so flavorful and tasty! It goes great over rice. I&#39;ll tell you, the fact that they have some great Chinese dinner dishes PLUS dim sum is really going to make this place great.One complaint- $3 for iced tea. Boo.

Didnt come get drink orders for well over 5 minutes (1 other table occupied and its 4:30) finally get our drinks and order. We order dumplings kung pow and chongqing chicken. We got our food after others who arrived after us (not a huge deal but the dumpling appetizer didnt show up until we were half through our entrees) so appetizer didnt happen and we dont recommend the shanghai dumplings they were bland and not worth it. So we next needed boxes we asked another server (ours literally walked out the front door never to return) he went off never came back. We got our own boxes. Then we finally flag someone down for the check. After confusion we get it and wait another 5 to 10 to get it ran. Jesus. The kungpow is good but get it to go the service is not good mind you its dead ive got better service at slammed restaurants

Went b/c of the good yelp review to this CART-LESS dimsum spot, and the service was so bad I cannot recommend it. The dimsum was ok, not amazing, and certainly not seemingly worthy of the high recommendation on Yelp. Had the fried shrimp, which is my all time fave, and it was smaller than I&#39;m used to, just not as crispy and flavorful as I like, and finally, they did not have the sweet mayonnaise dipping sauce that yummy places like Ocean Seafood in Alameda has. The eggplant with stuffed shrimp was so bland that I actually gave it to some guests sitting at the next table. The shanghai dumplings were good, although seemed small, and the steamed dumplings were fine. The tea is not free - has to be ordered by individual cup not by the pot, and the whole meal was pricey and unsatisfying. Worst of all was the waiter who whizzed by, failed to take my neighbors orders for over 10 minutes, yelled about the restaurant, and made the experience unpleasant.

I have such a hard time finding good dim sum in SF - Chinatown is meh and I do not have the means/patience to go all the way to the Inner Richmond/Inner Sunset area.So, some friends and I were organizing an event and wanted to have some nighttime dim sum (genius, no?). Most dim sum places don&#39;t cater/do massive orders or offer dim sum for dinner. But MaMa Ji&#39;s was SUPER accommodating AND presented me with a bottle of champagne when we went to pick up the order. Such sweethearts.Our guests raved about the food.We will be back again and again.

The dim sum is light, fresh, and tasty which are words that sometimes don&#39;t go in the same sentence when it comes to dim sum. But at Mama&#39;s they do. The portions are just right, the atmosphere is a transformed Queen Malika with long tables, school lights and a very lively vibe to it. It&#39;s the definition of the Chinese notion of re nao which roughly translates as a restaurant being hot, loud and boisterous. i.e., it&#39;s a happy place. The only downside for our palettes is the nighttime dishes (even toned down) are so very spicy that we couldn&#39;t even eat it, which is a shame. But that is the Sichuan style of cooking.

There was a line 20 people long out the door in the rain of people waiting for tables when we left last night, and now I know why. This place is great! It has great, exciting food, a fun and happy vibe, and warm service where everyone seems to pitch in doing everything, so that it seems like someone is always taking care of you.

Best dim sum in the city, by far. Have had multiple Cantonese friends say stuff like &#34;This tastes just like how my mom makes it&#34; etc. They also have an awesome Szechuan menu in the evenings, while still serving a subset of the dim sum as appetizers.

Ever since my boss told me that it was the best Sichuan restaurant in San Francisco, my friends and I basically try to go every week. The food is amazing!I&#39;ve never been to Sichuan but I have had Sichuan food in Singapore, Hong Kong, Beijing and Shanghai and this is definitely on par. So amazing to have something taste so good and then be able to pair it with a Chimay Tripel. Love this place and would definitely recommend it to anyone who loves a little spice in their life :)

Incredible! It lives up to the hype. The food is fresh and delicious. Good, clean place. A little small, so expect to wait a (worthwhile!) bit. The dimsum isn&#39;t rolling around in carts, if you&#39;re looking for that experience. Papa Ji walks around and pleasantly converses with his diners.

Yum! Yum! And YUM! Fantastic food, and inexpensive. We had to wait for about 15 minutes this past Saturday around 1pm. 100% worth the wait. We ordered about 5 dim sum items plus the kung pao chicken. All were delicious. Most often when I go to dim sum and the bill arrives it&#39;s a scary thing. NOT here!

The food was absolutely mouthwatering. The dimsum that Mama Ji&#39;s offers is probably the best I have had in the city thus far, and their wings are to die for. Make sure to get there somewhat early since it is a popular place or else you&#39;ll have to wait for a good while. But definitely worth the wait! I&#39;m definitely going to eat at Mama Ji&#39;s again soon and often!

This was the most unique Chinese food I&#39;ve had. The couple who owns and runs the restaurant are hospitable, social, and accommodating. The recipes are from her grandmother and they don&#39;t disappoint. I wasn&#39;t a huge fan of the Belgium beer pairing but the seasoning and spices on the chicken are really spicy and delicious. I left sweating but with a smile at the same time.

Previous to my most recent visit, I would have given this place 4 stars for the fresh dim sum. The food has always been a cut above the rest, and the service passable. However, my most recent visit left much to be desired AND the turnip cakes were not up to their usual standards. Whereas before they were impressively fresh (I could taste the turnip) and not oily, this time they were no different than other turnip cakes I&#39;ve had at other dim sum places. What prompted me to write this review, other than the disappointing lack of consistency of the turnip cakes, was the service. Nobody came to take our order (a piece of paper) for a long time. Our dishes took longer to arrive. Some did not come for a long time, until we asked, twice. In all, I had to flag someone down no fewer than 7 times to get through the meal and out the door. 7 times! And there were definitely lag times when the restaurant was not packed, so it wasn&#39;t that they were too busy, just inattentive. Disappointing, because I&#39;ve been raving about this local neighborhood joint to friends and now I&#39;m less than enthusiastic about going back myself.

A bunch of non-traditional Chinese food eaters searching for the real thing.. We heard this place was better than Chinatown, so we went for it.. Lucky we got there early we were the only ones there when they opened and by the time we left the line was out the door.. Spicy, (I mean it) delicious authentic Chinese food. The owners were so kind and explained all the foods and beers to us. We had a blast and enjoyed our dinner immensely! Parking was the only problem.

Visited Mama Ji&#39;s on Saturday night, after dancing up an appetite at Badlands, (gay bars play the best music, the guys love to dance and no one tries to pick up on you)!! But I digress..... 7 of us showed up around 10p and were happily accomodated. My 1st visit, but my friend Justin knew it well and ordered for us all. Even though the restaurant was full, the food came out promptly. OMG! From the braised greens, to the sweet/spicy/sticky chicken wings, to the fish stew....EVERYTHING was fresh, perfectly seasoned, hot and delicious! &#34;Mama Ji&#34;, herself, even came out to tell my friend Happy Birthday &amp; took a picture of the group for us. I am going back for the Dim Sum and bringing friends. I will also go back for dinner soon. It&#39;s an hr drive for me, but worth it.

You know how steamed BBQ pork buns usually taste like a lump of stale white Wonder Bread, stuffed with a dried out hot-pink piece of yesterday&#39;s pork soaked in a smear of Costco BBQ sauce? Well even if you don&#39;t, that is surely how other pork buns will taste to you in the future once you eat at MaMa Ji&#39;s.The food is lovely--fresh, with subtle flavors and intriguing textures, masterfully prepared. High quality and still very reasonably priced.I am keeping this short because I&#39;m torn about encouraging other people to come here. I want it all to myself!

Would not recomend. The restaurant is often very busy, no clue why. Prices seemed mostly okay though some items seemed a little overpriced in my opinion. But it really wasn&#39;t worth anything since the food was just not good. The service was okay. First I was assisted by someone who did not speak English fluently. I guess this was the waitresses assistant. The actual waitress was friendly and mostly available. The manager was visible and checked on the order. But the restaurant looks dirty, old, and out of date and just did not appeal to me. There are many tables crammed side by side in a small space. Meanwhile there is an oversized bar/service area that really has no purpose. The kitchen is behind what looks like a dirty shower curtain. The bathroom was also dirty, small, and looked like someone&#39;s apartment bathroom from 1970. There is outdoor seating but there are no heaters.

Wow! What an excellent meal. And what a great addition to the food scene in the Castro which I feel is a bit lacking.Every dish we had, a variety of dim sum, pea leaves, pot stickers were excellent. They also have a great beer selection, not the usual Anchor, Stella, Heineken, blah, blah, blah.There&#39;s a few kinks to iron out, service / decor, but they&#39;ve only been open 3 weeks. Going back Tuesday night for a friend&#39;s b-day dinner. Can&#39;t wait!Go MaMa Ji!!

Mama Ji&#39;s gives the Castro area a real good choice for Chinese food. The dim sum and spicy plates help make it a cut above the rest. The hot and numbing fish was fried heaven and the shrimp dumplings I had were tasty. Also a thumbs up for their long list of beers (bottle and tap). We drank a very dark Belgium beer that was filling (St Bernadus AB12) and good. The only real minus on the place is the noise within. The place is usually busy and the noise level can make it challenging to hold an extended conversation.

I used to love this place. Despite the fact that it is a tad expensive (par for the course for the area) and the service is sparse, it was pretty tasty in the past and as recently as a few months ago, it was a place I would have considered bringing my Asian, dim sum loving parents when they visited from out of town. However, today we ate here and I have to say the food is no longer good or authentic. It is bland, the texture is off, the dumplings are weirdly chewy as though they were left out, the lotus rice (usually my favorite) was dry. Dishes I usually salivate just looking at were completely unappetizing to me and I was left disappointed with an uncomfortable stomach. Maybe it was an off-day, maybe they changed their chef, but I&#39;m not going to risk the prices to come back. I can&#39;t bring my parents here in the future, sad to say. :( I&#39;ll be trekking out to the Sunset for my next dim sum run.

We loved it. Big dumplings, we way over ordered and had to take a couple containers home (which we promptly devoured later). My favorites were the &#34;house specialty&#34; chive shrimp dumplings, but we didn&#39;t&#39; get a dumpling that wasn&#39;t great. We also got the noodles with chile sauce which I thought were sublime but too spicy for my wife. The Belgian beer selection is an awesome bonus. Just a heads up that they won&#39;t seat you until everyone is there and I had dropped my wife and son off to look for parking and it took awhile, not a big surprise in the Castro.

I came back on a Sunday night with a group of friends. There were a lot of us, so it took a while to be seated, but everyone was very nice and super patient with some people who were a bit rowdy. This time we tried a variety of non dim sum dishes as well as a couple dim sum as appetizers. The regular dishes were very tasty and well portioned. I appreciated the friendly service. I will probably come back, as it&#39;s in my neighborhood and my friends like it. In fact, they told me to revise my previous 3 star (a-ok) review up higher LOL, so I did!

Went here about six months ago and just realised I forgot to review it. Wouldn&#39;t normally bother but this place is so wonderful that I couldn&#39;t not. I stumbled upon MaMa Ji&#39;s after reading a magazine review that gave it 4 stars - which frankly didn&#39;t do it Justice. The food was beautiful, the beer delicious - but most of all, the service left me feeling like I&#39;d come for dinner at a friend&#39;s. Run by the most welcoming couple, we were talked through our beer and food order, recommended which goes with which, and smiled at warmly throughout. Go for the food, the beer, and the warm fuzzy wuzzys. Can&#39;t wait to go back.

First time there, I ordered shrimp dumplings, which were ok, and cold vegetable noodles, which they accidentally put pork on. Completely flavorless and overpriced.

Order the fish in chili sauce then take the leftover sauce home and use it for two meals at home. It&#39;s WONDERFUL. Try to go when it&#39;s half empty or it&#39;s too noisy to talk.

It&#39;s a very hip, comfortable, easy-going, quintessentially San Francisco place offering extremely high-quality fare. We came for midday dim sum and wished we could have stayed all day sipping oolong tea until dinner when we could start all over with sichuan dishes and Dupont belgian beers. We loved every dish we tried from the turnip cake to the shrimp chive dumplings. It was so good. And where else can you have Ritual Roasters Coffee, choose from 4 belgian beers on tap (no to mention the bottle selection), and Red Blossom tea with delicious dim sum? The location is great, too. It&#39;s on a quieter part of 18th, away from the main on a residential block with victorian row houses that makes it all the more San Franciscan. This sweet little place is clearly very lovingly cultivated by the owners. I look forward to eating there again.

Unlike other reviewers, I&#39;m not a fan of the dim sum here- but this is still one of the best Chinese restaurants in SF. The menu is homey but sophisticated Chinese comfort food and there&#39;s a well-considered beer list.I love the fried turnip cake, the country ribs, and they do a great job with vegetables- especially green beans. My quibble with the dim sum is that like so many restaurants, it&#39;s ordinary- the product seems to come from a vendor (Kingdom of Dumpling?) and is completely outshone by the in-house production.High heat levels. If there are three red peppers next to an item on the menu, they mean it. Service can be flaky but always cheerful.

I came here the 7th week they were open and the service and kitchen were already completely up to snuff. The Szechuan style food here is done perfectly and they won&#39;t coddle you with dulled down spice if you happen to be a gwai lo. Unfortunately I can&#39;t even remember what I ordered at this point, but I do remember one of the dishes had star of anise in it which wasn&#39;t listed on the menu. I can&#39;t stand the licorice like taste of star of anise so that was disappointing, but the rest of the meal more than made up for that though.The two owners, a husband and wife, were very friendly, attentive and personable. They told us that they had no experience in the restaurant business, but from the yelp reviews it seems like they&#39;re gonna be a big success.

I was a little disappointed in MaMa Ji&#39;s. After reading the high yelp reviews, I figured it would be great. The food was good but the service made the experience awful. When we walked in, no one greeted us or offered to seat us. We literally stood there for 5 minutes and just decided to sit down. About 15 mins in, a waitress came over to take our order. There is a large coffee menu on the table. I asked for a latte(which is on the menu) and she said, &#34;Oh, I don&#39;t want to make that. I don&#39;t know how.&#34;. Um, ok... I&#39;ll have a water then. Then we ordered various dim sum and she was on her way. The plates started coming but unfortunately every plate the waiter brought was not ours. When we would say it wasn&#39;t ours, he would just place in on another table, which of course was not their food either. I saw some dim sum end up at 5 different tables. This went on for the entire meal and it took about 2 hours to complete our order. English was definitely not their strong suit, which is fine, but the lack of organization is dismal! Trying to get a bill was close to impossible and we aren&#39;t exactly sure if we paid for what we actually got.

We met the co-owner Marv while having dinner the week that Mama Ji&#39;s opened. He lives right in the castro, and told us he started Mama Ji&#39;s with his wife because he knows how hard it is to find good food in the district. 100% agree.As far as the food goes, it&#39;s good quality sichuan that doesn&#39;t require a trip to Chinatown and actually has good service. The dim sum was a bit standard but good. I enjoyed the specials and dinner plates :DSo, I love the owners now, and there&#39;s solid sichuan food right near where I live. Food is about 4 stars, service is 5 stars. I see a lot more Mama Ji&#39;s in my future.

I went there and got the Chongqing Chicken as well as the Chive Shrimp Dumplings. The chicken was pretty standard and pretty good. There was a lot more chicken and less chili than a lot of other places. It didn&#39;t mean it was less spicy than other places. That was a plus, they unfortunately spilled some chicken and I was hoping they would give us more since it was their fault...but they did the hit and run :(. The dumplings were definitely housemade. It made it hard to eat since once you took a bite out, the meat just fell. But otherwise the dumplings were very good, even though it was like a dollar per dumpling.

One of the few great places for food in the Castro.

I live in the Sunset and grew up eating dim sum regularly...Mama Ji&#39;s got it down. Tastes very fresh and way less oily than most dim sum joints. Didn&#39;t try everything but definitely want to go back for more. Pea Sprout w/shrimp dumplings were super tasty, tofu/shrimp - hot, tasty and NOT fried, shanghai buns - right amount of juice and flavor...and their vegetable buns were delicious - the filling is just how I like it - tofu, rice noodles, etc...only thing I would change is more filling and less dough but not easy to find good vegetable buns here in the city. Wasn&#39;t a huge fan of the bean paste noodles - noodles are good (maybe fresh) but sauce isn&#39;t my style.

My new favorite place in the castro. Casual and fun. Mamma Ji is great, super nice, and helpful. Great beer + wine selection. Food was awesome. Especially try the smaller appetizer portions. The duck fried pumpkin special was outstanding. If you&#39;re looking for ordering advice, it seems like many of the spicy dishes are made with similar sauces, so try not to order too many of them or you&#39;ll be getting very similar flavors.

Yum! Mama Ji&#39;s never disappoints. Owners are super friendly and accommodating. The food is delicious - particular favorite is the wonton soup with extra noodles. I&#39;d like to see a few more non-spicy options on dinner menu (more for kids than me) but besides that all fantastic.

A little bit off the beaten track but easy to get to and in a nice neighbourhood. Great experience and delicious. It&#39;s a nice touch to be able to choose from a menu instead of the old cart thing. I don&#39;t get to enjoy dim sum often enough but I really liked their choices and preparation. Definitely recommended!

Quick update, now that Mama Ji&#39;s has had a few weeks beyond their soft opening. They&#39;ve smoothed out the service and salt issues, and seems like it&#39;s already habit-forming for a lot of people in the neighborhood, including us. Hard to walk by and not be tempted...The atmosphere is relaxed and friendly and the food is SUPURB. The owners take care of customers without being overly solicitous.I honestly wouldn&#39;t go anywhere else in the city for Chinese food. And when it comes to dim sum, they&#39;ve aced out Yank Sing: Better quality, better selection (you can order from the menu instead of waiting for a cart to come around) and bargain pricing.

We&#39;ve been waiting for a great Chinese place to open near us and now we got two in one. Dim Sum is great, really any time of day and the Sichuan is...spicy. And very good. While an odd combination, there are some great Belgian beers in bottle and on tap. For after dinner there&#39;s Ritual coffee and small pastries available.

OMG first time there and it was great! Good beer selection (it goes really well with Sichuan). Had the onion cake, boiled beef in fiery sauce, and crispy eggplant. With custard bun for dessert. Service was excellent as was the food. And the price was really reasonable - our bill was about $20 less than I thought it would be. Good value.

Not your typical Chinese restaurant. It didn&#39;t have terrible customer experience or semi-grungy decor! Super cute family-run place! It&#39;s very obvious that the owners really care about providing a good customer experience.However, the food was lacking.. We came for dinner and was really hoping for a good Szechuan experience in the Castro. We ordered:- Green tea - excellent!- Pea sprouts with garlic - decent- House cold noodles - a little lacking in sesame/ peanut paste- FIsh fillet in chili oil - extremely spicy, which was good, but unfortunately was too sourThis place is no Z &amp; Y :(Will return to try the dim sum!

Menu is very basic but delicious. I dare say the chili bean paste noodle is the best I&#39;ve ever had of this kind. The owner is a nice guy. They haven&#39;t opened for a long time but from the queue waiting tonight it seems they are doing pretty well already.

I have to say this is one of my favorite chinese restaurants in the city and I am happier to go pick up food to go from here than have delivery at home. They get three stars because the last two times I have gone here I have had service issues. The first time was a to go order where the worker after running my card gave me the receipt which showed an extra item that I didn&#39;t order. To save time I told him not to recharge the card, and the extra chicken dish was amazing..but still not really good service. The next incident was in the restaurant. My date and I sat down and promptly order, three tables around us were seated and order shortly after us. I think they forgot to put in our order as the three tables around us order the same dishes and were eating and almost done before we finally asked where our food was. Again the food here is AMAZING...just have low expectations with the service.

Amazing place - great dim sum with Belgian beers to complement. Menu isn&#39;t too overbearing like many other places, so you get a great, homemade feel and taste. Highly recommended and the owners are great and offer helpful tips. This place is a must.

Seriously good dimsum comes to the Castro. We&#39;ve been here three times and can&#39;t wait to come back again. Favorites are sweet rice with shrimp, sausage, and egg in lotus leaf; turnip cake; and steamed BBQ bun. Authentic and value!

Finally, an authentic Chinese place in the neighborhood! Great service, kind owners, and awesome spicy food. If you want the real deal (hint: beef broccoli and orange chicken are NOT the real deal), come here. My favorite was the fried pumpkin with salted duck egg. Yummy.

A fantastic selection of Belgian beers, with a very knowledgeable bartender (who I believe was the owner). Pork buns were light and fluffy and the house special spare ribs were fall off the bone tender. The dim sum overall was very impressive given that this used to be a coffee house. The Chongqing chicken was super spicy and perfectly crispy. I will definitely be coming back.

I was a big fan of the Dim Sum at Mama Ji&#39;s before the remodel and, so, was really anxious to get back to try the new Sichuan dinner menu after returning to SF from a month long vacation. We went last Saturday evening around 7:00 and were surprised to find the place pretty crowded. One of the owners (&#34;The White Guy&#34;) greeted us as we sat down and took time to explain each item on the dinner menu. NOTE: This is REALLY helpful as it is often so really understand what some Chinese dishes are! My husband and I don&#39;t eat red meat so we stuck to the vegetarian and chicken and fish/seafood dishes. The Hot &amp; Sour Soup--vegetarian--was fabulous and a great way to begin. It&#39;s really hard to find a good, vegetarian version of this dish here. We continued with the Ma-Po Tofu, the Chongqing Chicken and one of the fish dishes (can&#39;t remember what it was called but it was amazing). The Tofu dish was delicious--large cubes of silky tofu perfectly cooked in a spicy, delicious sauce. I&#39;d never had Chongquing chicken before but I&#39;m a big fan now. It&#39;s deep fried and, then, cooked in the wok with lots of Sichuan peppers. Yum. The Castro has really been lacking in decent, let alone really good, Chinese food. I really think that Mama Ji&#39;s is going to make up for thatThat said, they really were very busy on Saturday night and the place filled up just after we sat down. But, while there were some service issues--and this is to be expected in a new restaurant--the owner went out of his way to apologize for any lapses in service and even offered us complimentary wine and dessert (a very generous gesture). So, I&#39;m going to be going back again and again for the great food. All new restaurants need a bit of time to get their momentum going. The really good food makes Mama Ji&#39;s stand out. Service issues can be fixed! Give it a try--you won&#39;t be disappointed!
