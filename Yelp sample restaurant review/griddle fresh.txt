Griddle Fresh reinforces my belief that paying for brunch is a good idea.Yelp&#39;ers, I cannot make &#34;6 hours corned beef hash.&#34; Can you? One time I tried to use the slow cooker, my beef turned into a rock. I know this isn&#39;t supposed to happen in a slow cooker so don&#39;t ask me how it happened, it just did.Anyway, you get my hint? Order the 6 hours corned beef hash. It&#39;s damn good. It&#39;s what I ate, it&#39;s what I could vouch for. Next time I eat here, I&#39;ll probably be adventurous and try something new. I&#39;m sure I won&#39;t be disappointed.Otherwise, it&#39;s a tight, homey spot that is filled with tasty smells and the food watching ain&#39;t bad either. Food watching - checking out someone else&#39;s plate of food. I just made that up. Genius.

Everything on the menu looked extremely delicious so it was hard to choose! I didn&#39;t have much of an appetite therefore I got something super simple, but nonetheless amazing!I ordered...CHIA SEED PUDDING: This was a bit sour towards the end but overall, I loved it. The peanuts added a nice crunch &amp; all the fruits were really fresh. The fact that their yogurt was home-made was pretty cool as well.My friends loved their hash browns &amp; it&#39;s cool that you can substitute for hash browns or add it to any dish. Definitely recommend doing that!CUSTOMER SERVICE: There was nothing too special about their service. I appreciated that they were quick &amp; friendly though!

Real cool spot!It was a Saturday morning and this place had a long line but luckily it moved pretty quickly and we were seated in 15 mins!It was fairly small on the inside but very very crowded. You could tell they wanted to get you in and out, but I didn&#39;t mind it so much since we had other things planned in the day.The service was good and consistent the entire time and they made sure to be attentive to our needs.I ordered an omelette and my fiance ordered a benedict. He really enjoyed his and while I didn&#39;t necessarily mind my omelette it just wans&#39;t anything special either. I kept seeing all the pancakes around me and those looked amazing but I just don&#39;t have a sweet tooth for breakfast. If my portion had been smaller I think I definitely would have gotten those to taste. The hash browns that came with my omelette were too greasy for my taste and the girl next to me ordered the fresh fruit on the side and it was such a generous side of tasty looking fruit I wished I had substituted. It definitely seemed like a place where you need to know what to order, so take your time and review or ask someone who&#39;s been there!I also ordered a pistachio latte because I love pistachio flavored things and wanted to try it. It tasted like a pistachio alright but after my fiance compared it to pistachio ice cream that was microwaved I lost my taste for it :/ The server was kind of enough to return it and just give me coffee instead.Overall it was a good experience and I liked the vibe of the place. Pretty decent brunch food at an affordable price in a good area.

Spontaneously decided to get brunch and did a quick search on Yelp for a place that would still be open and still serving brunch by 2pmish on a weekend. This place was our first choice!Wait was about 20 minutes, so we walked around the neighborhood for a bit before coming back. Once seated, he ordered his Crab/Shrimp Eggs Benedict and I ordered my Pistachio Latte and Lemon Ricotta Pancakes.The Pistachio Latte was delicious! If you like pistachio ice cream, you will like this. I thought it was a little too sweet for my taste, but I still love it.The Crab/Shrimp Eggs Benedict was great! I love how they make their hashbrowns, the crispiness is perfect! This is by far the best crab benedict I&#39;ve ever had and the added shrimps were a great addition! It adds a different texture, adding a juiciness to the dish. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!I wanted to love the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes but I really didn&#39;t. It tasted much too eggy and not sweet enough. Drinking my Pistachio Latte with this was good, but once I ran out I had to add some sugar. I would never get this again but am still curious about the other stuffed pancake option.Overall a great experience! Delicious food for the most part, I&#39;d love to eat here again!

Cute little spot in a cute little neighborhood! I&#39;ve had this place bookmarked for a while and I&#39;m glad I had the opportunity to finally try it. It was a Wednesday, so it wasn&#39;t crowded at all. Got a table right next to the window and the door. It&#39;s a small place, I&#39;d say at least ten tables inside and one outside (not really sure). There&#39;s a small window that looks into the kitchen with cute decorations. We were greeted immediately and got our food very quickly.We ordered:* Rustic Flat Omelette (Bacon, gruyere cheese, asparagus, garlic, shallot and grilled tomatoes) served with choice of toast and hashbrowns)* Tiramisu French Toast (special menu)* Corned beef hash with poached eggs on top and potato wedges* Bottle of Mimosa* Hot chocolate with whipped cream* Soy LatteEverything was delicious and the portions are just right; good enough to share amongst your peeps if you want. The service was fast since it wasn&#39;t busy &amp; wait staff constantly came to check in on us. Only one restroom but clean. It&#39;s such an adorable place! Definitely gotta try their Banana Mascarpone Pancakes next time.

With all these glowing reviews, I was hoping for something better. This place is tiny. We came at the perfect time for breakfast and got one of the few remaining tables left. Service was so busy, and barely around, so I can&#39;t say many good things about that.We went with some simple choices since everything was so expensive on the menu. We got an order of pancakes and scrambled egg whites. I gotta say that the egg whites were the fluffiest, biggest egg whites I&#39;ve ever had. It was actually pretty impressive except that some in the middle was a bit undercooked. The pancakes were okay, but they were the chewiest and densest pancakes I&#39;ve ever had... In a bad way.Maybe we should have gotten one of the more extravagant/expensive dishes. But then again i think that even the simplest of dishes should be made extraordinary...

Went for an impromptu brunch to avoid the line at Mama&#39;s or Zazie&#39;s. Despite being noon, we only waited about 10min.Ordered the Parma Benedict; eggs ben with ham, grilled asparagus, and a hash brown (got mine extra crispy).Eggs were poached properly. Hollandaise sauce could have been richer and more generous. Asparagus portions were small and texture was woody / stringy (def stalk, not tip). Hashbrown was tasty.Service was quick and friendly.Best for parties of 2-4; hard to see how a larger party can fit inside though.Overall this is an above average brunch place.

My boyfriend and I ate out for every meal on our 7-day vacation to SF, and our brunch here was the absolute BEST meal we had in the city. I randomly found this place on Yelp, and when we got there, the wait was 30 minutes, but it was absolutely worth it. I would probably fly back just to brunch at this place any day of the week. And this is coming from someone who never goes out for brunch, let alone waits 30 minutes for it.I got the &#34;banana mascarpone souffle pancake with vanilla curd and candied walnuts&#34;. It tasted as amazing as it sounds. The pancake was unlike anything I&#39;ve ever had, truly feeling like a cross between a souffle and a pancake. They must&#39;ve folded in beaten egg whites to give it the texture of a cloud--all I know was that it was delicious, and I savored every bite. The vanilla curd and banana paired perfectly with it. It was beautifully balanced and not too sweet at all.My boyfriend ordered the tiramisu french toast, which was one of the specials that day, and it somehow managed to outshine my outstanding souffle pancake, that&#39;s how good it was. It was easily the most decadent French toast I&#39;ve ever had, with each bite tasting equal parts crunchy, creamy, gooey, sweet, salty, and with deep caramelized flavor. My boyfriend has super high french toast standards, and even he was moved by their rendition. It even came with ladyfingers (bonus!) on top and a dollop of mascarpone.We were stuffed after both dishes and left with giant grins on our faces, our days now complete. Both dishes were reasonably priced for how big they were, around ~$12, and will easily keep you going for the rest of the day. The wait can be long, but this is one time where it&#39;s worth it. Service was great, and I loved walking around the surrounding neighborhood (Noe Valley) afterwards. Very yuppie, but also charming at the same time. If you&#39;re looking for brunch and you&#39;re anywhere near SF, you have to eat here!

The short: didn&#39;t like the original benedict.I wanted to like this place. The space was cute and there were a lot of items on the menu that looked appetizing.I ordered the original eggs benedict. When the order arrived, I noticed the potato hash brown and knew I wanted to add some ketchup for flavor. I got a lady&#39;s attention and the lady silenty stuck her finger at the condiment carousel, as if I should have known the ketchup was in a white and blue stripe container. Whoa lady. I proceeded to eat the rest of the hash brown, which I ended up enjoying with the ketchup. For the eggs benedict, the egg was a bit undercooked in that the whites were still a bit runny, but my friend (who also ordered the same dish) had a well cooked egg. In hindsight, yes, I should have gotten the silent lady to kindly take back the benedict, but I ate the rest of it anyways. I also wish there was more hollandaise sauce, though that&#39;s personal preference. And I probably prefer ham because I felt indifferent towards the Canadian bacon.An interesting take on the benedict, but I&#39;m not convinced that I would go back for the benedict, as I have other places that i prefer.

It has become normal to wait 1-2 hours for brunch on a weekend in San Francisco...that means the food should be worth the wait! A solid four for my overall experience here.Our group of four waited for about forty minutes for a table at 11AM on a Saturday. Thankfully that was not too bad at all. Always try to go early for brunch. This is a pretty small restaurant with only a few tables inside. Service was pretty fast and our food arrived quickly.We ordered and shared two savory and two sweet dishes. We got the smoked salmon tartine ($16) the 6 hrs. corned beef hash ($16) the banana mascarpone pancakes ($13), and the tiramisu french toast ($13). The smoked salmon tartine was okay. There was not enough salmon and lots of egg. The cream cheese also masked most of the flavor for me. The potato wedges came with both savory dishes. They were nice and crispy. Corned beef hash was alright. I guess I am more of a sweet tooth because I really liked the sweet dishes more. The tiramisu french toast was okay. Nothing too special and I couldn&#39;t really taste the tiramisu flavor. The best part of this brunch were the pancakes! Definitely don&#39;t miss out on these. They were sooo fluffy and light!! Not your average pancake.Prices here were a bit high for the food we were getting. However, the quality and presentation of the food was there. I enjoyed my experience here.

Everything was pretty good but the pancakes were amazing; it looks like a regular pancake on the outside but more moist than fluffy on the inside. The other dishes have some nice ingredients and nice presentation but some were little too salty or just ordinary.Go for: some unique and awesome pancakesDon&#39;t go for: a budget breakfast

This place is super popular. The interior is also really small so expect long waits on the weekends, especially if you have large parties. The servers are very nice though, and kept giving me approximate time estimates when I asked them to update me on the wait time.Here&#39;s what we ordered!Pulled pork scramble:This is pretty good. The scramble is a tiny bit spicy which makes it super yummy! The hash brown is also pretty thin and crispy, just how hash browns should be.Smoked Salmon Tartine:This was also really good. I couldn&#39;t really tell what was on the bottom (it was some sort of loaf), but it was topped with smoked salmon, avocado, and some kind of sauce. It was delicious!! This also comes with potato wedges which are AMAZING.Corned beef hash:This was very flavourful. The corned beef was a bit salty but it&#39;s actually pretty balanced due to the bland-ness of the potatoes. Also comes with potato wedges.Lemon ricotta pancakes and banana pancakes:YUM the panckes are so unique! The lemon ricotta and the banana pancakes are both delicious. The pancakes are super fluffy and the texture is really unlike any other pancakes I&#39;ve had before - they don&#39;t feel carb-y at all for some reason (I think it&#39;s because they use ricotta IN the pancake).

This is truly my favorite breakfast spot. Banana pancakes are delicious. I also ordered the salmon cakes with hash browns. Salmon cakes tasted a little burned but the hash browns are great. I didn&#39;t wait too long but there is always a wait so it&#39;s best to come early.

I love Griddle Fresh! Their service is attentive, and the food is always amazing. The 6 hour corned beef hash is the legit my favorite. It has real chunks of meat and tastes really fresh. The eggs are always runny (favorite thing) and the sauce that tops them provides an interesting flavor. It generally comes with wedges but I always sub those out for their crispy hashbrowns. Oh and I add avocado on top because it fools me into thinking I&#39;m eating okay-ish lol. Try their fresh squeezed orange juice. Last time I got it, it was perfectly sweet and it was so refreshing.One of the shorter waits for brunch in the city. But definitely still a wait on weekends. It&#39;s a pretty small place so I wouldn&#39;t bring a big group. Pricing is pretty standard for brunch, not too expensive in my opinion. Most of the parking is metered but there are some free street spots if you&#39;re lucky.

4 words: Banana Mascarpone Souffle Griddle.Okay so this griddle was the most uploaded picture on yelp for Griddle Fresh, so it should taste hella good. I was thinking, hopefully it&#39;s not one of those basic overrated dishes typical of certain restaurants. Good thing I ordered it because it was amazing!Came on a Saturday morning during Pride Weekend around 9:30am with a group of friends, and the place was already packed. It&#39;s a small restaurant that seats a limited amount of people, and I came with a party of 6 and waited about 15 minutes. What&#39;s interesting is that their menus are printed pieces of paper held together by a clipboard. Who needs to be mainstream and laminate their menus with fancy graphics am I right?Between two of my friends and me, we shared a banana mascarpone souffle griddle ($12.5), a savory reggiano griddle ($13), and a smoked salmon tartine ($13). So we were lazy and didn&#39;t want to ask for extra plates, so we rotated dishes and eating 1/3 of each plate. Thank God for non-germaphobic friends.1) Smoked Salmon Tartine (4/5): Delicious smoked salmon on top of a thick omelet with plenty of avocado slices underneath.2) Banana Mascarpone Souffle (5/5): It&#39;s so fluffy! The combination of a fried banana, candied walnuts, and fluffy souffle pancakes really hit the spot! Savory and very delicious. Btw it jiggles if you were wondering.3) Savory Reggiano Griddle (3/5): This is a nicely sweetened griddle, but I don&#39;t think the ingredients worked well together. The small cuts of bacon bits and mini arugula leaves didn&#39;t really match the texture and size of the honey toasted bread.I&#39;ll be back for more!

Yum-o. Got the lemon ricotta pancakes, rustic omelette and the salmon tartine. We were only two people, but we totally killed the dishes. My favorite was probably the rustic omelette because of how fluffy and how much veggies was in it. The pancakes came in as a close second. It was so light and fluffy that it kind of melted in your mouth. Lastly the salmon tartine was dubbed &#34;probably one of the best smoked salmon breakfast dishes I&#39;d ever had&#34; by my boyfriend. I wasn&#39;t a huge fan of that dish, but everything else we had was beyond good.

I wish I was able to come here more often, but the line would be ridiculous for the time I normally wake up for breakfast! The service here is great - so kind and patient. The omelettes are fluffy, the corned beef perfectly corned, and the lemon ricotta pancakes were weightless (but shoutout to the reviewer to gave the heads up to share them. They really are quite sweet!) So glad I came with a crew so I could try a little bit of everything!I think Griddle Fresh has the best hash browns, which are perfectly crispy on both sides with just enough chew on the inside. I can always count on a breakfast place if they have good hash browns. They also have fun latte drinks as well like matcha, red velvet, and pistachio!

I was looking for a decent place for brunch, saw this on the top of the list, went to try it out, and was absolutely impressed with how large the portions were, how flavorful everything was, and how friendly the staff and overall vibe was here!It does get busy here, and with it being a very small interior with a few outdoor seatings, do expect to wait a bit, but it wasn&#39;t too bad as there are waiting seats by the door and you can look at the menu to order faster when seated (trust me, you&#39;ll need that extra time to decide!).We waited about 20 minutes, then got seated and served by a very helpful and friendly waitress who answered all our questions and helped give recommendations to give us the best choices. I couldn&#39;t decide between sweet or savory, because they&#39;re most known for their decadent mountain of pancakes! But I ended getting their french toast, which was both sweet and savory with a fried egg, arugula, bacon, basil, strawberries, and honey. (wow!)I also had a pistachio latte which was silky and smooth, aside from all their other enticing specialty lattes like red velvet.Overall, the place is tight, but it is clean, well lit, and the service does not lag at all. Definitely worth checking out once you&#39;ve seen those pancakes!

I am a huge fan of this place...so huge that I came here TWICE within two days. If you need a recommendation for a comfy, down to earth breakfast joint, look no further. Can we discuss how intensely flavorful the corned beef hash is? OMG. Huge chunks of corned beef- it&#39;s literally and ridiculously to die for. The following day, I ordered the chorizo tartine...I can&#39;t even begin to tell you how friggin&#39; good this was. You&#39;re just going to have to take my word and GO. Like run.Bonus shout out to GF...thanks for accommodating 18 of us on that busy Sunday morning, ya&#39;ll rock it hard core.

The corned beef hash, salmon tartine and lemon ricotta pancakes are phenomenal! 5/5 starsI&#39;m not a huge pancake fan, but these fluffy pieces of heaven are a must try.Florentine Benedict is a healthier option and merits 4/5 stars.Be sure to get there before they close at 2:45pm on the weekends. Some people showed up at 2:15pm and got turned away. I think 1:45pm or 2pm on Saturdays is probably the best time to go to minimize wait time during prime time weekend brunch seating (likely 15 minute wait at that time). Otherwise be prepared for about an hour wait!

I&#39;m a true believer in the magic of crispy hashed browns. Griddle Fresh&#39;s hashed browns? Thin and crispy. ALL.THE.WAY.THROUGH. That&#39;s the whole point of hashed browns right? Grated potatoes mean maximum surface area for all the nooks and crannies to become fried potato perfection!Griddle Fresh is nestled in the heart of Noe Valley and is surrounded by a plethora of boutiques, coffee shops, and bakeries. It&#39;s a very &#34;San Francisco&#34; neighborhood. And with all great SF spots, come 1-hour weekend brunch waits. If you come on a weekday morning though, you can stroll right in for immediate seating.MY RECOMMENDATIONS:1) Lemon Ricotta Souffle Pancakes w/ Strawberry Coulis - Light and fluffy with a meringue-like center. Just be aware that the airy center tastes more like egg white than whipped cream as it appears!2) Salmon Tartine - Smoked salmon, avocado, and scrambled eggs on a fluffy toasted bun, topped with dill hollandaise and pickled red onions. The tartine comes with seasoned crispy wedge potato fries that have a delightful coating similar to curly fries. You can sub them for hash browns if you&#39;d like.3) 6-hour Corned Beef Hash: chunks of flavorful, tender corned beef and potatoes, topped with poached eggs and hollandaise sauce. The wedge fries seemed like carb overload, but they&#39;re so delicious you can kiss your diet goodbye!Griddle fresh is a solid brunch spot! 4.5 stars rounded to 5 for some of their standout menu items, including the hashed browns, souffle pancakes, and salmon tartine. Good service, cute striped ketchup bottles, and tasty raspberry jam are the icing on the cake!

Best for smaller groups but our group of six came on a Sunday around 10AM and was seated by 11AM (I think we got lucky that adjacent tables left around the same time though).We got the Parma Flavor Benedict, Florentine Benedict, 6 Hrs Corn Beef Hash, Smoked Salmon Tartine, Lemon Ricotta Pancakes, and Banana Mascarpone Pancakes. Overall the food was good but not super amazing.The Florentine Benedict didn&#39;t have much flavor. The Corn Beef Hash and Salmon Tartine were both generously proportioned. The pancakes were smaller than I expected but really fluffy and sweet enough that you don&#39;t even need to add syrup. I liked how the hashbrowns were really thin and crispy.

I live in Noe Valley and have wanted to try Griddle Fresh since it opened....and since there have been lines out front.On a Sunday morning, we arrived at around 11 a.m. (worst time to wait in line for brunch). After putting our names in, we went for a coffee at Bernie&#39;s....returned to check where we were on the list. Griddle Fresh is tiny so we ended up waiting ~1 hr and 45 minutes. That is not a typo, that is for real.I know people say to evaluate the food separate from the wait...but if you can&#39;t experience the food without the long wait, then the two go together. I ordered the corned beef hash and instead of home fries, I got the hash browns. The corned beef hash was standard, nothing to write home about. The hash browns are quite good, very crisp and very thin; I tend to like a bit more potato on my hash browns but appreciate how thinly they are fried.I have had take-out here before, and I think that&#39;s the way to go. Otherwise, the long, long, long wait is not worth it.

While I was in labor... I texted my friend that I want the souffle pancake from Griddle Fresh right after I give birth. My friend delivered (yes she&#39;s awesome). The morning after I gave birth, she brought me souffle pancake and a savory dish I forgot. I was one happy mama.It helped that I gave birth at St. Luke&#39;s hospital which was nearby.Those pancakes are rich. I could not finish it in one seating. I think I ate it for 2 days. Looking forward to having some again.

For most people, Griddle Fresh is not the most conveniently located brunch spot, but if divinely fluffy, melt-in-your-mouth pancakes are remotely appealing to you, it&#39;s worth the trek out to Noe Valley. I don&#39;t really know what else to say about these pancakes; they are phenomenal, and if you have any love/appreciation/respect for yourself, you should check it out ASAP. My friend and I shared the banana mascarpone pancakes and the lemon ricotta pancakes. Both were delicious, and though we were really glad we got to try both, next time we visit, we&#39;ll probably do a sweet/savory split (they had a crab/shrimp/garlic spinach benedict that caught my eye).It&#39;s a cozy (read: very small) spot, so if you don&#39;t like waits, I&#39;d recommend 1) coming as a party of two or 2) going a bit later (there was no wait at 1:00 PM for parties of two when I left).

One of my absolute FAVE things to do: get brunch in the city.I&#39;ve tried a lot of SF&#39;s popular brunch places &amp; this place was another one on my food bucket list. I went on 4th of July around noon and the wait wasn&#39;t too crazy. I&#39;ve definitely been to other spots in the city that had crazy hour long waits so I was quite pleased.I ordered the Salmon Tartine which is open-faced with soft bread at the bottom, eggs on top of the bread, topped off with smoked salmon, avocado, and sauce over the eggs. It also came with a side of potato wedges on the same plate. The portions were huge for around $13. I made myself finish the whole thing cause it was SO good but I was extremely full afterwards. The fries were a bit salty to my liking but I still really enjoyed it&#39;s crispy yet soft texture.The service was pretty good too - our waiter checked up on us and re-filled water before us asking and the food came rather quickly!

Another brunch spot to try! It&#39;s overwhelming and fun at the same time! On this particular day, I was told about this Noe Valley gem. I wanted to venture out from my norm so this was totally happening!Be prepared to wait! In all, the place isn&#39;t very large and I probably had a 45 minute ticket wait. It&#39;s just something you have to expect here. Cool thing is that they have outdoor and indoor seating. Their decor is simple, frames on the walls and a bright yellow to pop out. Service was alright. Not really personable but cordial of course. They were efficient enough so that made me happy!Although they do not offer bottomless mimosas, they do offer bottles of mimosas for $20, ample enough for our party of 3. For brunch, I got the 6HRS Corned Beef Hash for $14. Big chunks of juicy beef brisket, corned, with bell peppers, read potatoes, onions, wasabi dill topped with 2 poached eggs and served with toast and an orange wedge. The flavors were good. I think for me, the potato chunks were pretty big which made me fill like they were using it as a filler to make the plate bigger. Especially since the plate was also served with toast AND potato wedges on the side, maybe make the hash potatoes smaller so you have a more balanced plate than just carbs. Just my opinion.I&#39;d definitely be back for another go at it. Curious to try another dish and see how well that goes! Come check them out :)

With my folks staying on Diamond and close to 24th, I told them all the great spots in the neighborhood, but for their Sunday brunch, there was no option other than Griddle Fresh. So long as we got there before the rush - and fortunately I got my folks out the door at 10, with the short walk we got there before 10:30 and thus before the big rush, just FYI.Once inside, don&#39;t expect a lot of space, but expect a lot of service. Our waiter quickly came over for drinks and to explain the menu, which is organized in a few different sections. Page for benedicts, one for sandwiches, one for regular breakfast stuff, one for cocktails as they do have a decent bar.My father got the Sea Board benedict, which did not skimp on the crab or shrimp. My mother got the smoked salmon tartine because she pretty much got smoked salmon at least once a day. My sister got a special that had like french sourdough toast and strawberries that was actually really good.As for me, I went ala carte with an order of the salmon cakes and potato wedges. The Salmon cakes are delicious - full of salmon and breadcrumbs, topped with a nice aioli, definitely good if you want something lighter than a burger or sausage. The potato wedges are a must order. Thick cut, crispy fried, and well seasoned. Exactly what you want in a fry. I didn&#39;t realize the ketchup was on the table, but that finished the perfection.If you are in Noe or the southern portion of San Francisco, I highly recommend this spot, but make sure you arrive before 10:30 or be prepared to wait. Hitting up the liquor store next door does make the wait go faster.

Had better hopes for this place but there really was just nothing special about it.Ordered the Smoked Salmon Tartine, the Corn Beef Hash, and the Ricotta Pancakes. The Corn Beef Hash was okay and their hash browns were good. But as for the Salmon Tartine, they stacked it with WAY too much scrambled eggs that it over powered everything else and made the dish feel too heavy. The layer of avocado was minimal and all bruised and black (really though?). There also wasn&#39;t much smoked salmon to begin with -- I guess piling on the scrambled eggs was what was supposed to fill you up.The Ricotta Pancakes were pretty burnt and tasted more like whipped egg whites rather than ricotta pancakes itself.The service was alright, given that our food came pretty fast. But they never tried to refill our water even though our cups were empty. Servers weren&#39;t very pleasant either. You can definitely find better food and service elsewhere. And on top of that, their food ended up giving me the runs! Never. Again.

Love this place, quick friendly service with the best looking best tasting breakfast meals ever!Their super thin hash browns are to die for. The scrambled eggs are so fluffy and cooked right and not over cooked. Love the coffee and the staff and yes, get there early or you have to wait.

One of the B-E-S-T breakfast/brunch places that I&#39;ve had in SF!Given, I&#39;ve been to Zazie&#39;s, Mymy&#39;s, &amp; Kitchen Story - I think this place is definitely in my top 2.We ordered:- Salmon Tartine +8.5/10Craving for something savory and less sweet? This plate is the best best for ya! The sauce on the salmon was amazing &amp; the potatoes - OH MY LORD. I don&#39;t usually like potatoes &amp; usually ask for a substitute for fruit but completely forgot to - but I&#39;m glad I didn&#39;t! The potatoes are delicious &amp; my friends gladly finished my leftovers.- Lemon ricotta pancakes +9/10So... fluffy.. I&#39;m.. going.. to ... die!! This was the first pancake in my life that I ate that didn&#39;t require me to use a knife - it&#39;s THAT soft. A MUST TRY when visiting this spot!We didn&#39;t bring a car but parking did look difficult (as any brunch spot in SF would have) - so try to bart around the city if possible! The service was superB and the ladies serving us were extremely attentive &amp; nice. Can&#39;t wait to recommend this place to others!

THIS PLACE WAS AMAZING! We came around 9:30ish before pride, there was a short wait and your party must all be present before seating. I think the line can get pretty long though.Very interesting menu with mimosas, pistachio latte on the drinks side.I got the mozzarella, prosciutto, tomatoe eggs benedict. I seriously moaned when I ate this. Ahhhhhhh the melting mozzarella really gave it the kick. Omg I would get this over and over again. But the HASHBROWN WAS BOMB. So cripsy all around, ATE IT ALL and i usually never finish my potatoes.To top it off, the banana souffle pancakes are also the star of the show. So fluffly, floats in you mouth, you don&#39;t even have to try and cut it with a knife because it&#39;s just like air. And I don&#39;t know what cream fraishe they use but it is sweet and packs a punch in my tummy.I was so happy.

Hands down, best brunch food in the city. If you&#39;re not here early, expect a 30 min to 1 hr wait. The entrance gets really crowded and there&#39;s not much waiting room either so you&#39;ll most likely be waiting outside. I usually order the smoked salmon tartine and it is delicious. The hash browns are also unique. Flat, crispy and take up your entire plate. The service is very efficient. This place is well worth the wait.

The family and I visited early one Tuesday morning, there were plenty seats available and it never quite filled up while we were there. Inside is nice and cosy but still room to move.I had the eggs Benedict, it wasn&#39;t perfect but I would still have it again. The eggs were nice and runny, although some egg white was too, the hollandaise was tasty but wasn&#39;t too exciting and the hash brown was good but a little too crispy for me. My wife had the pancakes which was a tower of sweet goodness, I only tried some once it had got a bit cold but it was still tasty.I didn&#39;t attempt to get a cappuccino and stuck with standard coffee. I did try my wife&#39;s hot chocolate, it was alright.Overall a nice place for breakfast.

Came for Brunch on a Saturday &amp; expected a long line.. but actually only waited about 15-20 min? Not too bad for brunch on a weekend!I ordered the Smoke Salmon Tartine w/ a side of hashbrowns, and YES, the hashbrowns and thin and crispy andddd delicious! I&#39;ve read so many great things about their tartine - I had to try it &amp; boy am I glad. The lemon dill aioli was the perfect match for the smoked salmon, along with the avocado (cut beautifully) placed underneath. The omelet was seasoned &amp; fluffy - but I seriosuly wonder how many eggs were in there cause it seemed like such a large portion.I barely even finished my plate of food and left feeling VERY full and satisfied. Definitely one of my favorite brunch places in the city!

Finally got to try Griddle Fresh. There&#39;s no way to come during prime time and get seated timely so we decided to come an hour before closing. We were sat within 15 minutes which was pretty nice. Interior is more rustic than some other kitchy, modern brunch options in San Francisco now.I ordered the lemon ricotta souffle pancakes which were unimaginably fluffy. So cloud like! The lemon zest definitely help to cut the sweetness too from the provided frosting, powdered sugar, and syrup (haha). I also tried a bit of my mom&#39;s benedict. The eggs were perfectly poached but proscuitto wasn&#39;t as substantial as Canadian bacon/ham...so I&#39;m not sure how I feel about this.Brother and dad seemed to enjoy their choices as well. Everyone found their meal to be more than filling...definitely going to come back to try other menu items!

One of my favorite brunch spots! I&#39;ve been here a couple times and normally I go with one of their benedicts, it comes with their hashbrowns (WHICH I LOVE because they are so thin and crispy!!) Their lemon ricotta souffle pancakes are also very good. They are surprisingly light, but I wouldn&#39;t be able to finish it myself, it&#39;d be way too sweet.

Came here with my boyfriend the day before Mother&#39;sDay and at first we weren&#39;t too excited to see the wait. We stopped by Starbucks to kill time, and honestly the wait after that trip wasn&#39;t too bad. We sat inside, where it can be a little cramped with all the tables so close together, but nonetheless, it was still fine.My boyfriend ordered the grapefruit mimosa and garden scramble, while I got a green matcha latte and the fried egg sandwich. Seriously, our meal was so delicious that I think we found another breakfast spot to add to our list. Usually, we head to Savor a block or two away from Griddle Fresh, but it&#39;s nice to know we have options!

This place changed my life. BEST BRUNCH I HAVE EVER HAD ON ONE PLATE.Rustic Flat Omelette bacon, leeks, shallot, asparagus, gruyere, swiss cheese, mushroom, topped with grilled tomatoes. English muffin. Lemonade. Flat hash brown.Delicious. Fluffy eggs. Fresh ingredients. Came on a plate with this thin, crispy &amp; delicious, light potato hash brown thing - omg - incredible.The english muffin was cooked on the griddle and tasted just like a savory pancake. It was unbelievably good.I still can&#39;t believe the eggs/veggie combo. I enjoyed every moment of eating it. I am still thinking about it. I VERY RARELY get this excited about food, but those eggs....And an orange sliced. Had a fresh lemonade too. It was strong and sweet and I like it that way.

What To Do If You Want Birthday Cake for Brunch:1) Go to Griddle Fresh during a random weekday. (Weekend lines? No thanks.)2) Order the Lemon Ricotta or the Banana Mascarpone Souffle Pancakes ($12.50).3) Admire the poofy stack of sugary goodness.4) Express your disinterest in the savory breakfast items your brunch buddies are enjoying.5) Enjoy the sugar high before you crash.6) Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz(6/2015, 10/2015)

Came here on a Friday morning, place was filled but we were seated quickly and drink orders were placed immediately.I had the Florentine Eggs Benedict with an addition of shrimp (cause who don&#39;t love some shrimp with they eggs) Food was fresh and warm coming out no later than 10 minutes after ordering. The hash browns were slightly burnt on the edges but very crispy without having the burnt oily flavor. Yolk oozed out of the eggs perfectly and tasted amazing with the spinach, tomatoes, and mushrooms.Our waiter kept filling my coffee cup without even having to ask and service was great! Will definitely making regular trips here...

I got the lemon ricotta souffle pancakes. People rave about it in the yelp reviews and i gotta say it was pretty good. It was cooked well and i enjoyed it.Friend got the original eggs Benedict. He said it was good. I got to try some of his hash browns and they are yelp noteworthy.Feel like this was a standard brunch place in SF. It was delicious and I food coma-ed afterwards.Only downside was that my friend got his food way sooner than I got mine. My friend finished half of his food before I got mine.

Bustling brunch place that&#39;s on a super busy part of the strip on 24th st.The rustic omelette with bacon, onions, and cheese was decent but a bit too greasy for my taste.The hash brown is awesome. My favorite part of any hash brown is the crunchy surface portion. Here they did the hash brown so thin that that&#39;s all one gets on the plate. Ingenious. Well done!

Oh my goodness this place is amazing. I always try to look for places that have good pancakes and good corned beef hash but usually it ends up being one or the other. This place is (so far) the only exception to that rule.The corned beef hash is beyond delicious. It&#39;s got a nice soft texture - the only kind that you can get by slow cooking it for hours and hours and an awesome tangy taste. I thought that adding a side of potatoes was a little bit too much but they were still delicious so I&#39;m not complaining. It&#39;s so soft and really good and I definitely recommend trying it.The pancakes were pretty decent and if I hadn&#39;t tried Bea Beas in LA I would say they&#39;re amazing but sadly I&#39;ve already tried the best BUT it was still pretty good. I definitely recommend paying extra for the 100% maple syrup because it&#39;s worth it.All in all I had a good experience. The line wasn&#39;t too ridiculous and the service was somewhat attentive so I have nothing to complain about. Will come back again when I&#39;m back in town.

Other than the wait, everything was pretty amazing. My date and I got there before 11am. Our wait time was about 45 mins. That is not a long wait time for Sunday brunch. When we got our food, the line got longer. Lucky to be up a littler earlier, less of a wait.My eyes are always bigger than our stomach. We ordered 3 dishes, I wanted to order more. We got the Lemon Ricotta Souffle Pancakes. I really enjoy it but its more of a souffle than pancake. My date wanted more pancake so he did not like it as much as I did. But it was so soft and not too sweet. We were sitting outside, everyone outside waiting and walking by couldn&#39;t stop staring at it because it looked amazing too.Also got the Smoke Salmon Tartine and the Italian Omelet. Italian Omelet, meat in every bite. I really love their hash brown too. Thin and crispy. Their fresh fries are good as well. Everything was super yummy!Parking can be tricky. Drop your party off and look for parking.

I&#39;m pretty sure Agnes was referring to the souffle pancakes when cried out, &#34;It&#39;s So Fluffy...&#34;Food: I come here for the infamous lemon ricotta souffle pancakes. Light, spongy and delicious. These are hands down the best pancakes I&#39;ve ever had (outside of my home). This is my standard whenever I eat pancakes outside of my home. The reason why I love them so much is because they&#39;re light, I don&#39;t like heavy/dense pancakes, so these are great. I can eat the entire stack without feeling terrible, especially because they contain more egg whites than most pancakes. However, I will admit there were a few things that could have been better, for example, the flavor in the pancakes are a bit inconsistent. I tasted hints of lemon in some bites, but not all. Similarly, the ricotta was concentrated in some bites of my pancakes, not spread out amongst the entire stack. They&#39;re topped with fresh cut strawberries (though not enough, imo) and strawberry coulis. The coulis is sweet, I didn&#39;t really use any of the syrup that came on the side. The presentation is perfection. This meal heightened all of my sense and I was definitely eating with my eyes &amp; mouth. So pretty, you won&#39;t want to cut into them. My boyfriend ordered the Banana Mascarpone Souffle Pancake topped with fired bananas &amp; candied walnuts. These had a similar texture to mine, but his were a bit too sweet for both of us, they&#39;d be better with raw walnuts.Service: Hit or miss. Sometimes the servers are friendly and attentive, other times they&#39;re just doing the bare minimum, but this is usually during the peak brunch hours or anytime after 9am. I highly recommend coming at opening if you don&#39;t want to wait in a long line.Ambiance: Rustic, clean &amp; darling. However, a very claustrophobic spot. Be prepared to basically share a conversation with the people next to you. I&#39;d recommend getting one of the corner tables or the side tables for a bit more privacy.Price: Most dishes are about $11-14, the pancakes sitting on the lower end. Fairly reasonable for the quality, but portions are not the largest.Overall: Though service can be hit or miss &amp; portions aren&#39;t the biggest, I&#39;d come back here time after time for the pancakes. Always consistently delicious &amp; high-quality! Definitely an underrated SF brunch spot that deserves more attention!

One of my FAVORITE brunch places. I found out that the owners of Mymy and Griddle Fresh are related (brothers and sisters), which is probably why their menu is very similar to Mymy&#39;s.They don&#39;t take reservations, so be prepared to wait. This small little brunch place is in Noe Valley and easy to spot as it always has a bunch of people waiting outside. Now, you would think coming with a party of 2 would be faster, wrong. They have more tables for parties of 3-4 than tables for 2. Expect to wait 1-2 hrs on weekends. You can shorten the wait time by either going very early (they open at 8am) or closer to closing (2:45pm).They have a clipboard system where you write your name, number in your party, if you have any preference for outside or inside seating, and if your entire party is present. Your entire party has to be present in order to be seated and you have to be present at the restaurant when they call your name or else you risk losing your spot/table.Now, to the good part, the food. I died and went to heaven when I had their corned beef hash and the banana souffle pancakes. The pancakes were HUGE and super fluffy with that delicious souffle center. And even though it sounds super sweet, it wasn&#39;t overbearingly sweet. It definitely satisfied my sweet cravings. It&#39;s a great dish to share. The corned beef hash was also delicious with giant chunks of soft tender juicy corned beef. Both dishes are a must order.Next time, I&#39;m getting the salmon tartine.Service is very friendly. Although the food doesn&#39;t come out right away, I mean it does take time to make, the staff is very prompt.Price is very reasonable for the amount and quality. Prices range between $10-20.If you haven&#39;t been here, you must try it. Actually I take that back, if more people find out about this gem the wait would be redonkulous!

This is my go-to spot from breakfast/brunch. When visitors are in town, I suggest going here. It&#39;s always consistently good food and affordable.On this particular visit, we had the Corn beef hash, SF omelette, and Salmon Tartine.Corn beef hash - I haven&#39;t found one equal to this in this city. You usually relate this to filipino corn beef hash... Have to say, this is much better. There are serious chunks of homemade corn beef. It&#39;s substantive, filling. And poached eggs.... perfect golden yellow runny! You know that&#39;s legit.SF omelette - GF&#39;s omelette are big and hearty, but light in texture. Filled with every bite with sausage, tomatoes, cheese. My brother thought it was a little sweet, like had some maple syrup in it... I tried it again, and damn, he was right. How could I miss that? Maybe HE should be Yelping! A little disappointed in myself for missing that, but not disappointed in the dish.Salmon Tartine - very light and tasty. Smoked salmon was on point, and (again) as my brother said, that dill makes the dish. Gives it the pop it needs. Eggs are fluffy and the bread added some substance and crunch.Pet peeve: Dishes coming out one at a time, piece-meal, so only one person gets a dish and then next one does after some minutes... Please bring them all out at once. It&#39;ll avoid that awkward angry time when you want everyone to be eating with you... Plus, the food gets cold when they all come out! it&#39;s not like a family style chinese restaurant where that may be OK....I&#39;d come back again... hopefully, it&#39;ll all come out at once as it usually does. Maybe it was an off day. And maybe I should take my brother again too. He paid, so it&#39;s all good.

Worth the wait, but don&#39;t expect any level of service. I ordered the fried egg sandwich, and it was okay. The bread was too spongey so it broke apart pretty quickly, so be prepared to eat your sandwich with a fork. The sausage patty was too smokey/fennel-y for my taste. I&#39;ll definitely try this spot again and get the pancakes or French toast. Did I mention the service was non-existent?

I have nothing but good to say about this restaurant. I think I&#39;ve found my absolute favorite breakfast spot. And favorite is a very strong word. And now I am deeply saddened I live a seven hour drive away :(We thought it would be crowded for brunch but arrived and were seated right away. But let me say, this place must be underrated or not yet heard of by many in the area. You can tell when you eat the food here, it was made with care and love for each customer.I got the smoked salmon tartine and it was so good. The egg was so nice and fluffy, with enough salmon topped with onions and sauce. I like the way everything on the plate came together, each layer in one bite. I usually get egg benedicts but definitely glad I tried different this time. It just all tasted so good. Even the wedges were nice and crispy but perfectly soft on the inside.AND my friend ordered avocado as an extra touch to go with his corned beef, which was also very delicious - soft and not completely shredded and well seasoned - and they served a whole half of an avocado. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve seen any other restaurant do that. People are pretty stingy with the avocado. That says a lot about this restaurant in my opinion.Yeah it&#39;s a little tight inside. And no there is no fancy patio seating, but the food and nice waitresses that come ever so often to fill our cups of coffees or ask how we&#39;re doing with a smile made my experience here better than fantastic.

Ate brunch here on a Saturday, the wait was pretty long cause inside it is small and narrow, not many tables. I ordered the lemon ricotta pancakes which were pretty good, light and fluffy and it wasn&#39;t too sweet that you get sick of it. The portion was perfect, 3 pancakes. My friend had the salmon tartine because we saw it was a favorite and that was equally good and came with good fries! However the extra side of hashbrowns is not worth the price , it is super fried and is a really thin sheet. Overall the meal was great, however there&#39;s nothing super special so I wouldn&#39;t wait over an hour to eat here again.

Yes, please!Right after flying in from LAX, a friend picked me up and brought me over yonder. Wait, but this isn&#39;t...in the cool part of SF. Why....are we here? Oh, the store may not look like much and the cups might not be mason jars, but do NOT underestimate Griddle Fresh! This was everything I was hoping for and more. And bonus points? Parking is not too bad.Smoked Salmon TartineLook through the pictures on Yelp. It&#39;s even better. And the potatoes are delicious too.Banana Marscapone Souffle PancakeOrder it. I kind of don&#39;t want to spoil this one for you, but order it. And then cut into it. Don&#39;t unstack them, just...don&#39;t. And be amazed.Corned Beef HashCorned beef? Isn&#39;t that what the American families eat for dinner? UM MAYBE, BUT THIS DISH IS GREAT. Throw a poached egg on top and some potatoes on the side, and you have something that I would gladly eat on the regular. This dish kinda makes me wonder what the hipster brunch places are waiting for on their stale &#34;unique &amp; local&#34; menus. Nom nom nom...Get these three things. Doesn&#39;t matter how big your party is. It&#39;s delicious and worth it. That&#39;s right, one of the more amazing and unique breakfast/brunches I&#39;ve had in quite a long time comes from this little shop, not the latest gentrified brunch and specialty coffee shop. Which kinda makes sense when you think about it, since those tend to all be the same...Anyway. If you&#39;re in the area (meaning the bay), do yourself and a friend a favor and visit. It&#39;s worth it.

There was something magical, or maybe it&#39;s something about Griddle Fresh, but the experience was kinda awesome.Me and about 12 other friends decided to get brunch, and when you roll 13 deep, it&#39;s hard to get a seat anywhere. We decided to meet at Griddle Fresh at 11, with the expectation that we&#39;ll probably wait at least an hour, maybe more.It must have been the perfect storm of unlucky number 13, the rainy weather, and somehow bumping into long lost HS classmates because we were seated in 30 minutes. Unheard of with my SF brunch experiences!So we sat, and we ordered, and we ate like no tomorrow. Everything was delicious, from the tartines (chorizo ftw!) to the souffle pancakes (super fluffy) and those hash browns (extremely thin means extremely crispy).Am i still afraid of getting brunch in the city? Yea .. but if adventurous me decides to venture out again, I would definitely head to Griddle Fresh.

Great neighborhood place for breakfast or lunch!! Husband loves the hash. A lot of hash is super fatty. Theirs is lean but also super moist. Husband says it&#39;s the best hash he&#39;s ever had. (Very close to mymy&#39;s).I thought the veggie scramble was awesome. Pesto and tons of veggies.The hash browns are only the crispy part. Super clever!

I came here really wanting to try the crispy hash browns haha! Since I&#39;m allergic to eggs I couldn&#39;t try a lot of items on their menu. I got the corn beef hash, the flavor was good but definitely oily. The hash brown that I so wanted to try was sitting on a layer of oil thus turning soggy! Service was okay just your typical brunch I&#39;m glad I tried it but wouldn&#39;t come again.

All time favorite brunch place in San Francisco.Like every place on the weekend, there&#39;s often a wait, but it&#39;s always been more than worth it.Everything I&#39;ve had from the turkey club to the beef hash has been perfection. But the real clincher is their hash browns. Absolutely cannot be beat.

IT&#39;S SO FLUFFY I&#39;M GONNA DIE! Remember when that happened in Despicable Me? Yeah, that thought rang through my head too when I had the ricotta pancakes. The amazing fluffy pancakes, generously stuffed with ricotta and topped with strawberry, melted in my mouth. It&#39;s so filling but oh so addictive as you encourage yourself to just have one more bite, and then one more, and then the huge stack disappears before you realize it.But my friend and I didn&#39;t stop there - after all, brunch is all about balancing the sweet and the savory, right? We debated among the few scrambles on the menu, and decided in a split second as someone&#39;s steaming plate of pesto scramble passed us by. As a huge fan of pesto, I was pleased with its strong taste. The scramble was well done - not too funny but not over cooked either. I do believe that eggs are one of the hardest dishes to cook because it takes skill to make the dish stand out. In this case, Griddle Fresh succeeded.As with all other SF brunch hot spots, the line is your main obstacle to your food. Come early, leave your name, and then walk around Noe for a bit. Enjoy your afternoon away from the hustle and bustle of the city.

Went there on a Saturday, mid-morning because the line at Tartine was too long. It wasn&#39;t a long wait here and the food was well worth it. The service can be inattentive at times, but I will definitely come back again. The Tiramisu Stuffed French Toast was sublime.

Came here on a Saturday around 12:30pm. The wait wasn&#39;t too bad. The food was good. Make sure to try the lemon ricotta pancakes. However the service SUCKS. I ordered a side of eggs, never received them. My food came before my boyfriend&#39;s. By the time his food came, I was already done with mine. We asked for a side of chipotle aioli for his Tex Mex scramble and she just threw it on the table saying &#34;here.&#34; Kind of rude if you want my opinion. I gave 3 stars because the food is okay but they have some rude ass waitresses unfortunately.

My boyfriend and I decided to come here for brunch earlier this week and absolutely fell in love! I love that the waitress were so attentive and friendly. We got our water and coffee refills every time our cups was close to half-way empty.The reason for the trip to Griddle Fresh was for the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes. Instead, we saw that they have Banana Mascapone Souffle Pancakes and decided to share that after also seeing the beautiful pictures of it on Yelp. It was amazeballs. The texture was nice and fluffy and the bananas on top made it perfect.I ordered the Smoked Salmon Tartine instead of my usual order of Eggs Benedict when I go out for brunch. I am soooo glad I ordered the Smoked Salmon Tartine instead! The bread was nice and crispy, along with the perfect amount of smoked salmon on top, everything complimented each other. The dish was flavorful and filling. On top of that, the wedges were nice and crispy! I originally planned to substitute hashbrowns instead since I am not a fan of wedges, but I forgot to mention it during the order. I was not disappointed with the wedges and even my boyfriend, who doesn&#39;t like potatoes as much (whether its hashbrowns, wedges, etc) even enjoyed them and finished all of his wedges!I would definitely come again to try more of their other dishes. However, the dishes are a bit pricey but well worth it!

I grew up pretty darn poor and now I live in the most expensive place in the country and buy $20 plates of eggs Benedict.STARTED FROM THE BOTTOM NOW WE HERE.JK. I&#39;m actually pretty ashamed to say this isn&#39;t the first time I&#39;ve paid $20 for single plate of Eggs Benedict in San Francisco.Flashbacks of being in grade school and not having enough money for the standard $2.10 daily lunch and then pretending like I just wasn&#39;t hungry or like when Lunchables were really cool but my family couldn&#39;t afford them so my Dad would valiantly make me lunches with random Ritz crackers and American cheese wrapped in so much aluminum foil that it&#39;s a miracle I didn&#39;t have early onset Alzheimer&#39;s at 12 and then basically being laughed out of the lunch room by the kids who were only moderately less poor than I was have me more than a tad riddled with guilt after a Griddle Fresh breakfast.But in a place where $2700 is the going rate for a 400-square foot studio apartment that comes with nothing, I only have my own madness to blame for ordering the most expensive dish on the menu... and also a $5 matcha green tea latte... oh, and the $12 Gooey Boule French Toast With Sweet Cream.What can I say? B*tches gots to eat.Those will probably be the words on my tombstone and/or cardboard box in a few months when I&#39;m homeless because I ate a few too many $40+ breakfasts while on a sunshine high because California, man... it just puts you in the mood to not eat hobo food in your dark, dank apartment when it&#39;s 75 degrees in winter and the sun is shining on your face at 9 in the morning.While I clearly splurged on the Sea Board (Dungeness Crab &amp; Shrimp) Eggs Benedict, fancy new age latte, and second sweet back-up breakfast, it is entirely possible to have a reasonably priced breakfast brunch here with pretty every dish except the one I ordered falling in the $8-12 range.The Sea Board Eggs Benny was good, but not the best. Zazie really has the Benny to beat, but Griddle Fresh isn&#39;t shy with their crab and shrimp and I could see where it would be a $20 dish... plus, you do get a crap ton of food, mores so than Zazie.The plates are hearty as well. My big spender dish came with a threshold of thinly splayed hashbrowns betwixt the plate and the crabby and shrimp-y eggs Benedict with perfectly poached eggs.If there had been salt and pepper and/or the offer of hot sauce at the table, you wouldn&#39;t get any guff from me, but there was not and between when our plates arrived and we finished them, there really wasn&#39;t anyone who came by and gave us the opportunity to ask. One of the perils of eating at one of the two outside tables, I think, instead of condiments and spices there&#39;s a tiny little side of neglect and you will def need to ask any and every time you want your coffee refilled.The place is tiny so expect a wait and don&#39;t be a dummy and show up with more than 4 people unless you want to gum up the system and be waiting for 2 hours. There&#39;s no dedicated wait area so you&#39;ll just be hanging on the street corner and probably get pretty impatient as your morning comes to a close.I&#39;d totally go back again if in the neighborhood in the am. Parking nearby before 10 is easy peasy and the neighborhood is cute and sunny one to chill in.

Seems to be a little hole in the wall, the food was pretty good and the latte was good. I came all the way from the east bay but wasn&#39;t &#34;wowed&#34;. Don&#39;t get me wrong it was really good but nothing special I can definitely find something as good and closer to home. If you&#39;re near by give it a try if you&#39;re far don&#39;t drive all the way to the city for this place.

The food here is delicious! I&#39;ve come here 5 times, and it has become my go to brunch place.This time I got the strawberry ricotta pancakes, Italian omelet and egg sandwich.The pancakes are light and have just the right amount of sweetness. The itialian omelet is fluffy and comes with a delicious hash brown and two slices of toast. The egg sandwich was not my favorite. It could have used some more spiciness to balance the sweet patty. However, the potatoes wedges were so good! They were lightly fried with a flavorful batter. So good!

This place has a long line and food is decent.I ordered the lemon ricotta cheese pancakes. The title of the dish has souffle but the description of the pancake doesn&#39;t mention how eggy the pancake is. Seriously, I felt like I ordered a plate of egg whites. I couldn&#39;t finish the pancakes so I decided to order something else. I ended up with chicken apple sausage and fries which were good.They gave me fries on the house which I appreciated.Also ordered green tea matcha which I enjoyed.To come here you need to be in the mindset of egg heavy flavor, if you like that you shouldn&#39;t have a problem.

Fantastic breakfast! The San Francisco omelette was remarkable, with fresh avocado. The whole family couldn&#39;t keep its forks out of my niece&#39;s French toast--to die for. I wholeheartedly recommend this place for families, couples, and anyone who digs a good, hearty breakfast.* * Edited to add: We enjoyed Griddle Fresh so much the first time we went that we went back for a second helping before leaving San Francisco. This visit, they were much busier than last time. We were seated promptly. We ordered our food. And then waited. And waited. I understand that when a restaurant is busy, service will be slow. Side dishes were served first, as if they were appetizers. Two of our three breakfasts came. We waited another half hour for the third breakfast; the waitress seemed confused when we asked about it. When it finally came, it was wrong. What rapidly became clear was that when they&#39;re very busy, they&#39;re out of their depth. I don&#39;t know if it was the server in question or the busy-ness they were experiencing on a Saturday morning (which phenomenon you&#39;d think they&#39;d be familiar with), but though the food was still terrific, the service significantly suffered. If it had been our first visit rather than our second, we wouldn&#39;t have returned.Recommendation: Try to go very much earlier than you&#39;re planning so as to miss the rush. Or try to go on a morning that might not typically suggest breakfast out. They&#39;re much more on their game when things are slower.

This is the third time I&#39;ve been here and my last. The service is absolutely horrible. After ordering I had to ask for coffee twice and three times for a refill. Our food took way to long and mine was delivered 10 minutes before my friends. When I asked about the second entree I was rudely told it was coming.The food is very average and over priced.I work in the restaurant business, I would be fired if I gave this kind of service.

My favorite brunch spot in SF! Came in with friends on a weekday and were seated within minutes. The waitstaff was very attentive and had coffees and waters for the table within no time! I ordered the garden scramble with avocado and it was delicious. The pesto in the scramble makes it very flavorful and it came with a heaping serving of crispy hash browns and toast. We also got ricotta pancakes to share for the table and they were everything you&#39;d want out of a pancake: fluffy, flavorful and sweet.

Griddle Fresh&#39;s omelettes got me like, whoa! I have never experienced omelettes like theirs. Yes, it was an &#34;experience&#34; for me. Dear omelettes around the world, it&#39;s sad to think of all those wasted years I&#39;d thought I didn&#39;t like you. You were just &#34;okay.&#34; Now I&#39;m like, schwwwwwiiiing! Griddle Fresh makes them crazy fluffy and airy.Now, let&#39;s talk hash browns. I&#39;m generally not the biggest fan but they do them super thin and crispy. Like, just the edges of a normal hash brown. This intrigues just because I&#39;m one of those people that like the burnt end pieces that other people reject (mmm...gimme all the crispy carcinogens!).There&#39;s a long wait but for once, I didn&#39;t feel like another SF jerk waiting in line for 40+ minutes on a Sunday (read: hungry and freezing my butt off in the street).Ahh...those eggs, girl....those eggs. They worth it.

No lines on a weekday. Just finished my blood labwork this morning and this was nearby, so trying a new breakfast place. Banana souffle pancakes and seafood benedict (shrimp and crab)... hash browns was the best I&#39;ve tried and I don&#39;t like hash browns. These souffle pancakes are just like the ones at Aloha Kitchen in Hawaii... finally found a place locally. My wife and I give this a 2 thumbs up. Go on a weekday as the weekends are up to a 2hr wait.

About the service: went at 10AM on a Saturday and turn over was quick. Not terribly impressed with wait staff. We had to go inside to fetch condiments for our meal. Server came by maybe once then it was flagging down other waitstaff to get what we needed.About the place: Not good for groups. Pretty small but has two tables outside with heat lamps.About the food: ordered the 6hr corned beef hash for $15.50. A little pricey IMO BUT they do give you a ton of corned beef along with 2 poached eggs with really good dill (which typically I don&#39;t like) aioli. Beef is with red peppers, would have liked more of them, and potatoes. Then you also get potato wedges which next time I&#39;ll probably sub for fruit though they are really good. It&#39;s just a little too much. English muffin comes with -- was pretty good...a little sweet which was new for me.

Craving some breakfast on a weekday morning I looked through my list and picked out Griddle Fresh as my next target to try out. The reason they were there is because their lemon ricotta pancakes made this year&#39;s 7x7 list. Having just had some of Plow&#39;s delicious rendition of that dish this weekend, this seemed like a good choice with a basis for comparison still fresh in my mind.Unfortunately, I was thoroughly disappointed by the pancakes. I really wouldn&#39;t even classify them as pancakes so much as they were thin layers of dough barely containing an explosion of ricotta inside. It was just too liquid, cheesy and sweet to eat much of. Add on the syrup, strawberries and whipped cream and this was just over the top of what one person can handle. Sadly, I had a few bites and couldn&#39;t eat any more.Still hungry, I ordered the 6 hour corned beef and was very pleased with how this dish turned out. There were huge chunks of really moist and stringy corned beef topped with poached eggs and a tasty sauce. The fries that came with it were very crispy and enjoyable as well.Overall, I might be spoiled forever by great lemon ricotta pancakes and this place certainly didn&#39;t live up to those expectations. However, I did enjoy a different dish here so it wasn&#39;t a total loss. I definitely don&#39;t think that these pancakes deserve their spot on the big eats list though. Normally I&#39;d give it an &#39;I&#39;ve had better&#39; rating, but the corned beef gets this place bumped up to &#34;A-OK.&#34;

I know SF loves their brunch, but I just don&#39;t get it. Why would I want to spend $50 for pancakes and eggs for 2 people, when it only costs $5 at home? I&#39;ve given the famous spots a try, stood in line for hours, had my expectations be built, and then shattered as soon as I realized what a rip off it is.When I do bookmark a brunch place and tell V about it, the first thing he does is roll his eyes at me. Why? Because he knows that he&#39;ll have to listen to me complain as soon as we step out of the restaurant.So when we were looking for a spot to have lunch on a Sunday, I figured it was a good time to try Griddle Fresh! The pictures seemed drool worthy, and souffle pancakes aren&#39;t something I can make. It took V a little bit of convincing, and I had to agree that I wouldn&#39;t complain (hmmph).We arrived around 11:45 and put our names down on the list. The wait was about 45 min, which isn&#39;t bad compared to the more popular places in the city. Before we were seated, we (meaning I) had already decided on the smoked salmon tartine (substituting the fries for the hash browns), banana mascarpone souffle pancakes, and a side of sausage for V. The food came out relatively quick.HOLY MOLY. I took a bite of the smoked salmon tartine and it was mind blowingly amazing. The toasted brioche was fluffy, the omelet was light, the sauce was heavenly, and the smoked salmon just put it over the top. The hash browns were thin and super crispy. I started doing my happy food dance, which surprised V since he knew we were at a brunch place! Now for the banana mascarpone soufflee pancakes. NOM. So light. So fluffy. Yet not ridiculously sweet. SO GOOD. I heard tables around us asking how they do the pancakes like this, and I second that. Glad to have pancakes that I can&#39;t easily replicate ;)Out of all the places I&#39;ve visited in the bay, I have to say Griddle Fresh is by far my favorite for brunch. Do yourself a favor and come here!!!

Fellow brunchers, BE WARNED: prepare to wait a long time for weekend brunches. It&#39;s popular, and for good reason. If you&#39;re like me and hate to wait for anything, suck it up and endure the wait for this place. It was so damn good, and I&#39;m glad we waited! It&#39;s an extremely small restaurant, which explains the long wait times, but the service is quick and fast--so you really won&#39;t have to spend much time waiting for your food. Bonus points!We ordered the salmon tartine and the lemon ricotta pancakes. Because, let&#39;s be real, these are really the reasons why anyone comes here. I ordered my salmon tartine with the classic potato wedges while the boyfriend opted for their most famous hash. Tbh, I prefer the wedges over the hash (but it&#39;s because I prefer wedges/cut potatoes over hash). They almost tasted like french fries!The tartine is kind of like their twist on an eggs benedict. Which I think is way better than a benedict because I&#39;m not really a fan of English muffins. Theirs is on a brioche bun, which is amazing and soft and delicious and I&#39;m salivating just thinking about it now. Also--portions are very generous. I got a lot of salmon on mine!The lemon ricotta pancakes were good, but they weren&#39;t as good as I expected. I love pancakes and I love souffles, but something about these weren&#39;t quite right. I think we had way too much ricotta in our pancakes that I couldn&#39;t even really taste the pancake anymore. It was straight up lemon ricotta--where&#39;s the pancakes?! But don&#39;t get me wrong--they were still pretty good. I probably wouldn&#39;t reorder them next time though.One last thing: I strongly advise against bringing a large group. They don&#39;t do reservations, the restaurant is very small, and it&#39;s just not doable. There was a large group of 12 that had waited for hours before us, and they ended up leaving because there just wasn&#39;t room for them.

I got brunch here the other day, and it was very good! I ordered a latte and since I can&#39;t have dairy asked what type of alternatives they had, soy was my only option which was a bit disappointing as I would have preferred almond milk, but it was still a decent latte. I also ordered the pulled pork bowl with fruit and avocado on the side and it was phenomenal! The pulled pork was made with a chipotle sauce that gave it the perfect amount of spice and the salsa verde on top was a great touch. I was also extremely impressed with the fruit bowl. It was a sizable portion and unlike so many fruit cups at brunch places, this one looked and tasted extremely fresh (no mushy melon and withered grapes!).It was a bit expensive for brunch, but this is San Francisco, so I expected it. Overall: I definitely recommend.

the salmon tartine with avocado, onions, dill, hollandaise was delicious (and huge) and the potato wedges were perfectly seasoned and cooked (crispy on the outside, soft and warm on the inside). it&#39;s a testatment to how popular this place is that there was a 45 minute wait on a rainy tuesday morning, but it was definitely worth it. be sure to keep an eye out on the waiting time though since all the parking nearby is metered.probably a 4.5, but definitely in the top tier of popular brunch places.

My favorite meal of the day has always been brunch! And San Francisco has sooo many brunch spots that it is absolutely hard for me to pick one as my favorite. But this is definitely at the top of my list! My boyfriend also loves this place and always wants to come here whenever we are in the city.The eggs benedict are soooo yummy and by far one of the better poached eggs I have had in San Francisco. But the thing that sets this place apart would have to be the hashed browns, potato wedges, and the lemon ricotta pancakes. I absolutely love love LOVE potatoes and I must say the way they made the hashed browns and potato wedges are SOOO GOOD!! It is not greasy or oily and made to perfection! I could eat many orders of this! The lemon ricotta pancakes are sooo yummy too! So fluffy and not too sweet but better to be shared with more people because it is a LARGE portion! But omg, it is like heaven in your mouth! Soo good and so light!!!The place itself is not very big so expect to wait a while for a large party and during the weekends for brunch. Definitely should come early if you do not want to wait long! It is located in an area where you can walk around and even bring your doggy out for a walk! Outdoor seating is available if you want to get brunch with your doggy! Definitely a must try spot for brunch in San Francisco!!

Keep loving this place!Second time I&#39;ve been here -- get the banana mascarpone souffle pancakes. They are absolutely delicious! Just how I remembered them.Also had the BLT benedict and the garden omelet. The BLT benedict had a delicious hollaindaise sauce and the spinach and tomato were grilled and flavored wonderfully! The garden omelet had an array of vegetables such as fennel, eggplant, and asparagus with a delicious basil pesto. Yum yum! Fluffy eggs in each things.This place is great. The wait is pretty long on weekends. Maybe during the week it&#39;s less of a wait! Parking in nearby neighborhoods if you want a little.

Came here on a Sunday morning. Waited about half an hour to be seated. We ordered the French toast and the Tex-Mex Omelette. The French toast was so hard it was difficult to cut it with my knife. I&#39;m assuming it&#39;s because they used sourdough bread instead of regular soft bread. Worst French toast I&#39;ve ever had. The Tex-Mex Omelette was way better than the French toast. It was definitely flavorful and superb. The reason why I give this place a less than average rating is due to the long wait and their pricing. A lemonade is $4.50, like jeez, I&#39;m sure it&#39;s not even freshly squeezed either. Definitely wouldn&#39;t go out of my way to eat at this place again. Would stop by as a last resort.Also, customer service was lacking. Did not feel welcome by the employees. And my water wasn&#39;t refilled until I was done with my French toast.

I ordered the salmon tartine and it was seriously the best part of my day that day. The salmon was soft and juicy and the eggs that came with it were THE FLUFFIEST I&#39;ve ever had. Everything about this was dish was on point. It also came with potato wedges that were consistently crispy--hence, each bite was satisfying.The wait took a while being it was during the holidays, but the food was well worth the wait. Orange juice, though $5 a cup, was fresh and sweet. It took a lot of self-control to keep myself from drinking the whole thing at once.What turned me off about this place though was the fact that they wrote in our tip for us in the credit card receipt, which is why I&#39;m docking two stars despite the wonderful food. In no way are they entitled to choosing how much customer&#39;s tip. I&#39;ve seen other places &#34;recommend&#34; how much you should tip, but I&#39;ve never been to a place that actually writes it in for you.

Probably one of the best breakfast places I&#39;ve eaten at, let alone being in San Francisco. We ordered salmon tartine, original Benedict, hot chocolate, and orange juice.Pricing: the portions per item is pretty decent. My main complaint is the pricing on drinks.Taste: Absolutely delicious food portions. The potato wedges that came with the tartine was mediocre but the hash browns that came with the Benedict was delicious. The hot chocolate tastes like it came from a packet. The orange juice was sweet and refreshing.Would recommend if you don&#39;t mind spending a pretty penny and waiting in line. Small group of 2-4 people would be best.

This restaurant is part of an increasingly common and depressing SF trend: Too-cute-by-half breakfast places that charge fairly stiff prices for some occasionally quite good dishes, but forget how to do the basics. In my case I popped in for a Saturday brunch and had a pulled pork scramble (the actual name was more long and involved than that, as is typical for this sort of place). Although much more like an omelette than a scramble, it was yummy, filled to brimming with pork and assorted other goodies, including peppers, avocado and tomatoes. The problem was... everything else. The omelette was accompanied by hash browns, smashed into a wafer-thin pancake that occupied half the plate, cooked to the consistency of a potato chip. And like a potato chip, it was virtually impossible to eat with a knife and fork. Seriously, guys, if you want to serve potato chips instead of hash browns, just give me an honest bag of potato chips and spare me the hassle.My wheat toast turned out to be one pathetic little slice of toast, unbuttered and lukewarm when it arrived, accompanied by an ice-cold, pat of rock-hard butter, making it impossible to butter the toast properly. Yes, some people prefer their butter on the side, but those folks generally request it. If you must do it this way, at least make sure that the butter that arrives on the side is soft enough to spread. And an proper portion of toast is TWO slices, especially at these prices. Yikes.

One of the best breakfasts in recent memory. I ordered the Classic Eggs Benedict and it came out perfectly. I loved the thin crispy home fries. I also tried the banana mascerpone pancakes. They not only looked delicious but tasted amazing. Even though I&#39;ve grown to prefer eggs as opposed to sweets for my breakfasts, I would definitely order that again as well.This place is on the smaller side and late in the afternoon towards closing this place was still pretty full.

Best hash browns I&#39;ve had in a long while. Eggs were good and the bacon was decent. The toast was a bit too burnt for me to enjoy. Also didn&#39;t care for the ready made jam set on the table. I&#39;d rather have the tiny disposable strawberry, grape, etc containers you have to peel back. Little things aside this place was amazing. The waitress was sweet and we were in and out in under 45 minutes. Great spot. I&#39;d like to return again someday.

Came here with my bf one afternoon because I&#39;ve been wanting to try this place out! I was super happy because there was no wait and I was starrrving. It&#39;s a small breakfast place, has a really homey feel to it and the servers are pretty nice and really quick with waters.I ended up ordering the smoked salmon tartine with a side of hashbrowns, while my bf ordered the grilled bacon caprese sandwich and the lemon ricotta pancakes. I&#39;ve heard really great things about the tartine and the pancakes so I was definitely excited for this meal!!!The food came out after about 10 minutes or so and the presentations were beautiful!! The smoked salmon tartine was delicious!! Loved the lemon dill aioli, and the smoked salmon on top was extremely fresh, although there isn&#39;t a large amount of it. :( They do however give you a good heaping of avocado underneath. The chive omelette is really tasty too, I thought it would just be normal eggs, but it was so fluffy!! I also subbed my potato wedges out for the hashbrowns because i&#39;ve heard great things about the hashbrowns here! It was a good decision because they were so good!! Basically like potato chips but reminiscent of a very very thin hashbrown. The portion size of the smoked salmon tartine was perfect for me. After I finished I was pretty content, but then I went on to try some of my bf&#39;s food.....The lemon ricotta pancakes were basically like pancake clouds! So good with the strawberries and the sauce! I don&#39;t think I would ever be able to finish a whole stack on my own though, because they&#39;re huge!! The grilled bacon caprese was also really good, I loved the pesto flavoring and the crunch from the bacon, but was too full to take more than a bite haha.I would definitely add this to one of my top brunch places in the city! Their benedicts also sound really appetizing.

Such a fan of this spot! My friend and I went here for brunch, and I could definitely see why it was jam-packed with a waiting list. Griddle Fresh was tucked away in a cute little neighborhood, which was so pleasant to walk through. I had the Banana Mascapone Souffle Pancakes...and they were AMAZING. Exquisite, light texture and the whipped cream that topped it was not overwhelming at all. I often find banana flavored dishes very artificial, but Griddle Fresh perfected it. Come here for great food, good portions, and a fun time.

This is by far my favorite brunch spot in town. Everyday brunch menu that has nothing fancy about it but so utterly amazing - they seem to be best known for their lemon pancakes but I love their egg benedicts and tartines even more. Plus the hash browns are nothing like what I&#39;ve had my whole life! It&#39;s located in a quiet little neighborhood which gives it that homey and less crowded feel as well. Definitely a Noe Valley gem.

Wow. I haven&#39;t given a 5-star review in a while, this must be good.The first time I went here I had the Salmon Tartine and although it was delicious, I didn&#39;t get to fully enjoy it because it was such a large portion that I wanted to throw up by the time I left the restaurant. Obviously, I could&#39;ve just stopped eating like a normal person but 1) I&#39;m a monster and 2) I didn&#39;t want to waste a single bit of it!Did I really just complain about their portions being too big?Anyway, my second time around me and my roommate split two dishes: the salmon tartine once again and the lemon ricotta souffle pancakes. And it was the perfect amount for the both of us.The eggs that come with the smoked salmon are cooked exactly the way I like them: a little runny. The salmon itself is perfect, not too intimidating, and that lemon dill sauce they put on top makes me want to throw a chair at someone it&#39;s so good. Lastly, I love the touch of pickled red onion they put on top. It&#39;s a great compliment to the overall taste of the dish.Next up, one of my top 3 favorite pancakes I&#39;ve ever tasted - and I&#39;m not even a pancake person. These puffy clouds of orgasm are sweet enough to eat without syrup (although I like to drizzle a tiny bit on to have a different sweet taste), and definitely sharable.My only real complaint? The space is tiny, so I wouldn&#39;t suggest coming with a party over 4. You&#39;ll also want to get their early esp on the weekends. Otherwise, you&#39;ll end up eating your own arm while waiting to be seated. Still, it would probably be worth it. I can&#39;t wait to try toe Sea Board and banana mascarpone souffle pancakes next!

Wait: 1-1.5 hour wait for a table for four arriving at 11 am on a Saturday for brunch.Atmosphere: Small-sized restaurant with a decent number of tables.Food:1. Banana Mascarpone Souffle Pancake (mascarpone flour pancake with vanilla curd, fired banana, candied): Soft, fluffy, and creamy pancakes, which is very different from your typical pancakes. I was not a fan because the texture was too non-cake-like and bready for me, but everyone else at the table loved it.2. Tiramisu french toast (french toast served with lady fingers): Typical french toast with hints of tiramisu and coffee. Not too special.3. 6hrs Corned Beef Hash (juicy corned beef brisket, bell pepper, red potatoes, onion, wasabi dill, two eggs poached, with toast): Salty, crispy and delicious beef hash goes really well with the toast its served on top of, eggs, and potato wedges. Very big and filling plate.4. Smoked Salmon Tartine (smoked salmon, neufchatel, avocado, sweet pea sprout, red onion, thin chive omelette, lemon dill, aioli on brioche bun): Beautifully plated dish with pink colored smoked salmon and bright green avocados wrapped in a blanket of eggs. However, the dish was very bland tasting because the eggs were not seasoned well enough. The salmon was good, but the saltiness was not strong enough to dress the eggs.

I wanted to believe the hype. I mean, come on - SOUFFLE pancakes? It sounds like the most perfect creation in the world. The execution, however, is not done as well as I&#39;d hoped.LEMON RICOTTA SOUFFLE PANCAKES.Presentation is definitely a 10, but the taste is pretty mediocre at best. The lemon is barely noticeable, and the ricotta isn&#39;t sweetened, so the pancakes themselves are rather bland, like big, doughy pillows. Dousing them with syrup makes it a bit too sweet, almost sickeningly so. The one redeeming quality of the dish is the macerated strawberry coulis (which ended up being about 5 paltry strawberries, thus unable to save the dish in the end).SEA BOARD BENEDICT.The boy&#39;s choice, and so much better than the over-hyped pancakes. The eggs were perfectly poached, there were large, hearty chunks of crab along with garlic shrimp, and was a filling, tasty breakfast overall. The hashbrown was an interesting add-on as well.Note:Get here VERY EARLY (re: before 9:30 am) if you don&#39;t want to join the huge crowd of brunchers waiting outside for a table in this very small restaurant.

I was so excited about this place...the reviews, the pictures, the Banana Mascarpone Souffle Pancakes, &amp; the 6HR Hash, etc.It&#39;s a quaint, little cafe in a beautiful neighborhood. I love it because it&#39;s cozy &amp; intimate but very friendly. The servers were attentive &amp; helpful.The Banana Mascarpone Souffle Pancakes were visually delightful. I mean who could go wrong with those ingredients?! At first, the pancakes were delicious; they had a light &amp; fluffy texture that I liked. But then it began to have a strong eggy flavor. The sweetness mixed with the egg flavor became sort of unpleasant.The 6-Hour Corned Beef Hash also looked and smelled scrumptious. I loved how tender the corned beef was and how chunky it was! It wasn&#39;t an ordinary corned beef hash that looked like dog food. Texture-wise it was awesome and the poached egg was cooked perfectly! It all went well with the Wasabi Hollandaise Sauce. Unfortunately, as a whole, the dish had WAY TOO MUCH SALT. It became a little overwhelming in the end.I still have yet to try the other dishes. I&#39;m still glad that I gave them a try. I highly recommend the crispy potato wedges. Super crispy and light! So addicting! I&#39;ll be back. Hopefully I enjoy the next visit.

Came here on a weekday just few days ago. We were driving around to a few of my favorite brunch places, but lines were out the door. So, I searched around yelp and remembered that I&#39;ve been wanting to try this place for the longest time.Upon arrival, there was no wait and we were seated immediately. Right when I looked at the menu, the banana mascarpone souffle pancakes caught my eye. I debated on those for the longest time because I usually can&#39;t finish my food and I knew I wanted to order eggs benedict because its a staple for me whenever I get brunch. But, ended up going with the Salmon cake benedicts because it was something different to me. And, I couldn&#39;t resist how delicious the pancakes looked and went with those. My boyfriend ordered the frisco omelet.When we got our food, it looked pretty overwhelming.. haha. But, I dug into the pancakes first and they were so fluffy and light. I&#39;m usually not a big fan of heavy pancakes. The yolk of my benedicts were runny and done right, just how I like it. my boyfriend enjoyed the frisco omelet as well. Surprisingly we finished majority of our food and I had enough room to stuff my face with the lightest pancakes ever.

So good I teared up. This is not an exaggeration - I honestly literally teared up while eating their Lemon Ricotta Souffle Pancake. You could rest your fork on top and its own weight is enough to cut through the entire stack of pancakes. Incredible.When people ask what my favorite new restaurant is - I point squarely at Griddle Fresh.

I&#39;ve never even noticed this unassuming place before but I heard it&#39;s packed on weekends. Guess I&#39;m not that in tune with the brunch thing. During the week though you can just swan right in.I came for the lemon ricotta souffle pancakes - split with a friend. There were good, egg-y and souffle like. However, I&#39;m not sure if I like them enough to order again. It would have been better to have a souffle. I felt like the flavor was overpowered by the strawberries and the pancakes were a little dry. I would have liked twice as much syrup. Interesting - glad I tried it - not sure I loved it enough to come back.We also ordered the Mambo Italiano Tartine with hash browns instead of wedges. It was just bacon scrambled eggs on a slice of toasted bread. Wasn&#39;t particularly Italian. It was okay. Hash browns were amazing. Theirs are just a super flat pancake cooked super crispy.$15.55 per person for two dishes split, including tax and tip

Good food, friendly staff!My friend arrived at around 12:15pm but I was running late; couldn&#39;t be seated until the whole party&#39;s here but the server was nice enough to put my friend on hold on the list until I came! The menu is pretty self-explanatory and lists out all the ingredients in each dish.-) Italian Omelette: A-. Omelette wrapping around italian sausage, oyster mushroom, olive, rome tomato etc; I liked how the italian sausage was chopped instead of coming in whole pieces so I could taste the sausage in every bite. Oyster mushroom was a good choice making the whole omelette more unique than coming with standard mushroom. Rome tomatoes was fresh and its unique taste enhanced the whole experience.It also came with flat, fried hash brown which was crispy and smelled good. The whole wheat toast was hot and fresh.I wanted to try the orange juice but it cost $4.5! Although it said its fresh squeezed but I would rather just have water and get Philz coffee down the street.Service was good, I will go back and try their pancakes next time!

Simple and delicious menu targets anyone who likes it fresh and original. I came here on thanksgiving lunch. Even though the place was full we did not wait long to be seated and then for our meal to come. The staff is very customer and detail oriented. Chipotle chicken sandwich with seasoned French fries was juicy and flavorful. Mimosa with grapefruit juice was an excellent cherry on top. Strongly recommend.

Luckily, there wasn&#39;t much of a wait when we came here and found parking nearby. Sweet! Came around 1:30pm with a 15 min wait and one party ahead which was enough time to browse over their menu.They don&#39;t take reservations ahead of time so you write your name down on a clip board- it asks for your preference of indoor or outdoor seating and if everyone in your party is present.If you&#39;re a party of 2, sit outside and enjoy your meal al fresco on a nice warm day and it&#39;s less cramped than inside.Got the 6hr corn beef hash with poached eggs, Frisco omelette, and had to try the banana mascarpone souffle pancakes with candied pecans.I love anything with bananas so I had to try these banana pancakes. I wouldn&#39;t say it was the best pancakes I ever had or its life changing, but they were light and fluffy, not too sweet, and a good balance to my main dish which was more on the savory heavy side.The corn beef hash had a lot of flavor and very filling, but my poached eggs were a bit overcooked - not as runny I would like but still good.Overall, big portions, decent food, and attentive friendly service. Would come back if I am in the area but don&#39;t think it&#39;s worth longer than a 15 mins wait.

In the spectrum of SF Brunch Spots, while Griddle Fresh wins in portion size and value, their dishes did not grow on me as much. Tried the Smoked Salmon Tartine - my biggest complaint was that the dish was smothered in sauce and overall took away from the flavors of the individual components. I wish the base of this tartine offered more crisp or contrast as it became hard to eat a mass of egg and sauce and salmon. The Potato Wedges were a win on the side, great crispy-ness and seasoned well. The lemon ricotta souffle pancakes were OK but I run into comparisons again as I prefer lemon ricotta pancakes elsewhere- though I did appreciate how light and fluffy they were the strawberry coulis was a bit too sweet for me.

LEMON RICOTTA SOUFFLE PANCAKESHonestly, I wish there was more texture to this. Guess that&#39;s why I&#39;m a waffle kind of girl. I really wanted to like it but every bite felt so darn mushy (mushier than regular pancakes). The egg whites were more prevalent than the lemon ricotta flavor. There was no hint of crispness to the pancake, even on the outer layer. I was able to finish it while stealing a few of my friend&#39;s fries to crisp up my life between mushy pancake bites. I guess I should&#39;ve expected this because &#34;souffle&#34;, maybe I need a lemon ricotta waffle.6HR CORNED BEEFBig chunks of corned beef! But there&#39;s no way I could eat the corned beef without the help of starchy foods. I mostly had the fries which were pretty good in flavor and in crispness.Got here around 12:30p, hoping there&#39;ll be a short wait (based on the reviews) but turned out horribly long. It was an hour wait! So we walked around and got a banana walnut muffin from Noe Valley Bakery to kill some time. We were seated in about 45 minutes.

With babies in strollers and puppies on leashes outside, and bouquets of flowers inside, this is easily one of the cutest brunch spots I&#39;ve ever encountered. Very Noe Valley.standouts:- freshly squeezed orange juice is sweeter and pulpier than other varieties I&#39;ve tried- omelet was cooked to perfection with avo on top (they understand that a cool avocado paired with warm eggs is a winning contrast)- hash browns were nearly brittle- like: crispy through and through and wafer-thin, like a large crispy chip

I just had some Banana Mascarpone Souffle Pancake leftovers this morning and it made me realize this is seriously one of my favorite brunch places. While every single thing we ordered was excellent, those souffle pancakes really catapulted this quaint little brunch spot to one of my favorites of all time. I&#39;d recommend it even if you lived outside of SF--it&#39;s worth the drive and the standard 30-60 minute wait (what do you expect, people love their brunch).Oh goodness, can I indulge you more about those souffle pancakes? People fling the term &#34;orgasmic&#34; and &#34;foodgasm&#34; all the time on Yelp, but these pancakes deserve any and all positive description. It was like having a rich, gooey, fluffy, crunchy, warm cake for breakfast. I typically do have cake for breakfast, so the level of sweetness was perfect for me, but I can see this dish being a little much for normal folk who aren&#39;t addicted to sugar. For such people, I recommend the luxurious and eggy French toast, with its perfect balance of crispy borders and a soft, delicious center. I think it may come with maple syrup or butter, but the bread is so good and the flavor so robust, I don&#39;t think you even need these standard accoutrements.Another thing worth mentioning is the hashbrowns. They look like a thin matrix of fried green onions and tasted amazing! Nary a crumb survived on our plate even though we were stuffed out of our minds. Now, people who like hashbrowns for their heavy potato-y goodness may not like Griddle Fresh&#39;s take, but for me, I found them to be perfect. Hands down the best hashbrowns I&#39;ve ever had!To echo the other reviews, service needs improvement. Popularity is a double-edged sword--the staff here appears overwhelmed and very unhappy. Also, my order came after everyone else had finished with theirs. Granted, my hanger dissipated the moment I took a bite into those heavenly souffle pancakes, but here&#39;s hoping service/management improves next time we visit.

The short: there&#39;s hope for scrambles and hashes, don&#39;t be misled by the souffle pancakes.The food: the hash brown comes in a super thin layer crispy and buttery, perfect, but $4.50 is a bit much if you&#39;re ordering it as a side. The corned beef hash was excellent id go back for seconds. The souffle pancake are more like under-cooked pancakes with a meringue in the middle to make it puffy. There was quite a bit of raw batter on the plateThe service: Average, nothing horrid, but nothing amazing either. Waitress confirmed that the souffle pancakes are normally undercooked and stuffed with egg whites.Ambiance: The setting in very nice in Noe valley, the interior is also very average, nothing amazing, just very standard.Overall: If a friend wanted to go, I&#39;d warn them about the souffle pancakes. Would I go back? If a friend asked, but I wouldnt be the first to suggest it.

There are a billion brunch places in SF, and nearly all of them have LOOOONG waits. Griddle Fresh is no exception, but if you have just 2 ppl, you&#39;re in luck! Griddle Fresh is a small restaurant, but nearly every table is made for just 2 ppl - your wait won&#39;t be too long if come with just 1 other person. On a Saturday, we came by around 10:30 and waited maybe 10 minutes, but I saw some 3-4 person parties waiting much much longer.Now onto the food - the 6 hour hash is amazing, with its big chunks of tender juicy corned beef, and the lemon ricotta pancakes are SO FLUFFY. I was a bit amazed that the texture was very souffle-like. Other places claim they have a souffle pancake, but it&#39;s more fluffy cake than souffle. I thought Griddle Fresh&#39;s version was legit. I&#39;d recommend getting a salty dish and a sweet dish so that it can balance each other out. I think if I ate just one of these by myself, I might have gotten too much saltiness or too much sweetness.The bathroom&#39;s kinda dingy, and service was decent. Parking wasn&#39;t too hard to find either. I&#39;ll be back to try more stuff on the menu.

There&#39;s nothing I love more than a great brunch, and Griddle Fresh is my new favorite brunch spot evah! (Over the span of 6 years I&#39;ve pretty much brunched at every brunch spot in LA and am now living in the bay area.)Ordered the Eggs Benedict and the beau ordered the Tex Mex scramble.ABSOLUTELY loved both.Get the potatoes and the hash browns...to diiie for and worth the carb overload. I am not normally a fan of wedge fries/potatoes bc I feel like they&#39;re never cooked properly or evenly. However, these wedge potatoes were perrrfect. They were cooked thoroughly but held a crunchy outside! The hash browns were on another level. They were served surprisingly thin, but that is what made all of the difference. It was like only being served the best/crunchy part of hash browns and needless to say they were devoured.Portions are large. Food is made hot to serve.Ingredients are fresh!! The scrambled eggs melt in your mouth and the poached eggs are runny to perfection.Small and crowded restaurant but the vibe makes it comfortable and casual (aka, you don&#39;t feel awkward eating so close to another human being that you do not know). Also, the small size makes it easy to flag down a busy waitress but they serve you with an attentive smile.Will we be back? As often as possible.

MUST GET: hash browns! Drool. I don&#39;t know when I ever had such perfectly crispy hash browns EVER in my life.I shared the egg florentine and the banana souffle pancakes. I was pleasantly surprised when my eggs florentine came out with tomatoes and mushrooms. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve had an eggs florentine with those extra additions. I was a bit disappointed with my poached eggs - it was overcooked so I didn&#39;t experience the creamy yolk. But nevertheless, I still enjoyed my dish.The banana souffle pancakes looked SO delicious. I might even add it looks more delicious than it actually tastes. I was able to eat more than half, but couldn&#39;t finish the rest since it was a bit heavy for brunch. It was literally like eating clouds.. but pancake clouds - fluffy, but not too sweet. The portion is fairly generous. I recommend that you share with 1-2 people.Orange juice was fresh and delicious. Extra brownie points since I could bring my dog with me to eat outdoors.

At 1 pm on a Sunday the line was still insane. I was on my way to SPCA to volunteer but needed to check this place out. If its busy, most of the time its because the food is good. I was by myself so i was waiting for a table for 1 lol. After 30 minutes i was like mam i&#39;ll take anything i&#39;m alone so she kicks the old guy sitting in the chair in the table outside.The waitress disappears for 10 minutes and remembers she didn&#39;t give me a menu (smh). According to Yelp the Salmon Serpatine or some pokemon named shit like that was a good choice since it was different from the smoked salmon eggs benedict you can find anywhere else. 20 minutes passes and my dish arrives. It came with either a side of home fries or the very thin hash, i got the hash. It was useless, pointless, tasteless, mostly just burnt. The egg was scrambled and soft, should have not taken more than 5 minutes to make this. The salmon was blah, I engulfed it cause I was hungry but to wait for this was disappointing.I will come back for the pancakes another time but I will stay away from their egg dishes next time.

You shopping around for a brunch place? Just put your phone down and head over to Griddle Fresh. I men&#39;s warehouse guarantee that you&#39;ll like the way you eat.You know what? I&#39;ll do you another favor and tell you what to order. Go ahead and get the Banana Pancake. It&#39;s very fluffy. How fluffy? It is Agnes-from-DespicableMe-ITS-SO-FLUFFY fluffy. The pancake is also lightweight sweet and loaded with cream so maybe its a good idea to order one to share with the table.Get the Salmon Tartine too. They put some smoked salmon on top of a bright yellow omelette and many slices of fresh avocado. The omelette was fluffy too, but it&#39;s different. It was pillow fluffy. They basically rolled up an omelette to several layers, and when you sink your fork in, you can feel the elasticity through your silverware. Now imagine eating that.And when you have the option, always choose the Hashbrown. They make it very thin so that you can easily feel the crisp on both sides of the bite. It sounds like I&#39;m talking about a potatoe chip but it&#39;s definitely a hash. And it&#39;s good, so try it.Listen. I&#39;m not one of those brunch-believers who wait two hours in line every Sunday to break bread at Mama&#39;s. But I&#39;ll come back to Griddle Fresh because their food is amazing grace. Just stop reading and head over right now.

The service is fast and the portions of the food was great!!!! You have to order the Parma Flavor With Hash is a must! Hash is amazing and super thin and crispy, just how it&#39;s suppose to be! =P I have yet to try their pancakes, that also look good too! Can&#39;t wait to come back and see what else to try on the menu!

A friend and I took advantage of a big game day, when much of the city was holed up at home or at a bar preparing to watch the game, to come here for brunch, waiting no more than 10 or 15 minutes before being seated. With neither of us too hungry, we opted for (and didn&#39;t even finish) the:* Banana Mascarpone Souffle Pancake - While everyone else seems to love the fluffiness of these pancakes, we found it a little too soft for our tastes, especially combined with the bananas, as the only more textured component of the entire dish were the nuts, leading to mouthfuls of mostly, well, mushiness.* Corned Beef Hash - This dish, on the other hand, was quite a tasty pick, and reminded me almost of a deconstructed eggs benedict, in a way. Good flavors, with some excellent poached eggs on top, the only flaw being that the potatoes were a bit on the harder side (the fries, however, were excellent).Portions for both dishes were quite generous, so, given the normal (high-ish) price of brunch, there&#39;s good value to be had here.***Accessibility Info***Venue - While the walkway between tables is a bit on the more narrow side, as long as someone else isn&#39;t trying to squeeze by at the same time, a wheelchair should have little trouble fitting.Bathroom - Didn&#39;t check them out.

Food good but staff had major attitude. For example, I asked for ketchup and she snarled and showed me where it was on the table (it was in an opaque bottle that looked like it could contain syrup). Also, when I asked where my food was, she gave me attitude about asking. My husband&#39;s was brought out 5 minutes before mine and they didn&#39;t say it was coming. Could use some training on how to talk to customers.

Breakfast is breakfast and you really can&#39;t mess it up but the menu here is taking breakfast to a whole new level!My boyfriend got the matcha green tea latte and it was to die for. He also ordered the savory French toast which is the best of both worlds, sweet French toast with strawberries and then a side of arugula with Parmesan cheese and a runny egg.I ordered the San Francisco omelet made with egg whites and it was delightful! I love avocado and chicken sausage so I knew I wanted that omelet right when I saw it on the menu.We went on Mother&#39;s Day around 10:30 and the wait was like 15 minutes not bad at all, I was expecting much worse. If get tunes seated outside is quicker, take the opportunity because it&#39;s heated so you&#39;ll stay warm. Friendly service as well!

Delicious mimosas, amazing food, and sweet customer service. Thankfully we came during the week and did not have to wait in line. I had the spicy pop pulled pork scramble with hash browns, and it was savory. My friends had the parma flavor benedict and the chorizo jalapeno tartine, and they both enjoyed them immensely. I&#39;d highly recommend this place as long as you don&#39;t have to wait too long.

I have tried a bunch of brunch places in the city and I&#39;ve definitely had better than Griddle. I ordered the Savory Reggiano and it was way to oily and sweet. It literally came with bacon bits and arugula which seemed to come straight out of a box.The orange juice however was amazing.Don&#39;t think I will be coming back.

Got here a little before 9am on a Saturday, resulting in over half an hour wait for 2! Yup, they are popular, but deservedly so. I had the best souffle pancake ever here (lemon ricotta with macerated strawberries). So light and fluffy, with a delicate lemon touch. However, the sweetness on the pancakes adds up; probably should&#39;ve held back a little on the syrup. I think it&#39;d be better to share the plate and another dish with a friend, such as their corned beef hash. It comes with the best fried potato wedges, two poached eggs w/ an herbed sauce, nice hunks of meat that you can pull apart easily, more potatoes an a few token onions and peppers. Lastly, they have great crispy hash browns, too. I need to come back and try more stuff!

On a Thursday afternoon, this place was just the right amount of crowded but not enough so that my girl friend and I were able to snag seats towards the register right away! I decided to go with my sister&#39;s recommendation of the Salmon Tartine, which is like an open faced sandwich with a big chunk of salmon topped with vegetables, avocado, and their spicy aioli. It&#39;s a HUGE portion for $13 and they come with house fries! All I can remember is that I only ate half of everything and was super full. The staff was very accommodating and always kept checking up on us.Decent place for brunch, not sure if it would be my number one choice but you wouldn&#39;t be disappointed if you came here during their non-peak hours.

Takes forever to get a seat here, and you&#39;ll likely need to wait outside so be warned if it&#39;s cold out. But it&#39;s pretty good. Salmon Tartine and Lemon Ricotta Pancakes were great. The place is small and crowded though, you&#39;ll probably start feeling claustrophobic at some point. Good luck trying to get a table for any more than 4 people.

Small place, no reservations. Just put your name on the list and wait. The wait wasn&#39;t bad. Waited about 15 mins for two people.Salmon tartine was really good. I would go back for that alone! Think open face sandwich with scrambled eggs, avocado and smoked salmon. We subbed the potato wedges for hashbrowns. They make them nice and crispy here. So good!Classic benedict was nothing special. Would not order again.Lemon ricotta souffle pancakes was one of the best pancakes I&#39;ve ever had. It was light and fluffy.Service was good, they were always around to refill our water or pick up plates.Street parking isn&#39;t easy but not impossible.This is now one of my top brunch spots!

This place was bookmarked on my Yelp page for a long while, and the BF and I finally got to try it. He ordered the the 6 hr corned beef hash and I ordered the lemon ricotta pancakes with strawberries!We came on a Friday morning, so of course there was about an hour wait - which was okay because it was a beautiful day in the city. When we were seated they promptly took our order and our food was brought out quickly! This place is small so if you&#39;re kind of weary about sharing a little bit of your personal space with strangers, then this place may not be the place for you. Regardless, the food and service were great! I definitely will be coming back!

My friend and I ordered the lemon ricotta pancakes and the tiramisu french toast (special). They were both delicious, but we couldn&#39;t finish either of them because it got overwhelmingly sweet by the end. I prefer the tiramisu french toast because it had a nice sweet vanilla crust/taste even before using syrup. We also got a side of the hash brown which was good, slightly burnt on some spots, it&#39;s fried paper thin so I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s worth the price but was a good balance to the pancakes and french toast!

Even though they&#39;re open until 2:45, they stop seating at 2:30, which is not specified on their website or Yelp listing. We got there at 2:31 and they wouldn&#39;t seat us. Poor customer service.

Griddle Fresh is a super solid brunch option if you find yourself in Noe Valley, a cute little neighborhood tucked between the Mission and the Castro. Griddle Fresh is a small and popular restaurant, so naturally, expect to wait, especially on the weekends. The ambiance is cute and simple, complete with yellow walls and touches of wood. For starters, their drinks are really tasty. The matcha green tea latte was a fan favorite of my group. My best friend and I split an omelette and Griddle Fresh&#39;s infamous lemon ricotta souffle pancakes. The omelette was huge and packed with tons of delicious stuff (I don&#39;t remember the exact omelette we got.) I was most excited about their souffle pancakes which received a lot of praise from the many SF food Instagram pages that I follow. Unfortunately, they didn&#39;t live up to the hype in my opinion. They kind of have the consistency of uncooked meringue and they more or less fell apart into a foamy, gooey, mess. I expected them to either be fluffy or crepe-like, but they were neither of those things. The taste was great, but the texture was a little off-putting for me. The pancakes get a lot of hype, so try them for yourself, but the next time I go, I&#39;ll stick to the egg dishes!

I&#39;m surprised this place doesn&#39;t have more reviews! Came here Monday after yelping a place to eat.We got seated fairly quick, it wasn&#39;t too busy. Plenty of parking if you don&#39;t mind paying the meter. Neighborhood is really nice. Our server was great and attentive.Food was the superstar of this place! Got the plates that yelp reviewer often raved about and it was not a disappointment!6 Hour Corn Beef -- was amazing. Not salty at all. It was a little on the heavy side but no complaints because everything went really well together. The sauce they added to it made it real unique tooSmoked salmon tartine - I loved it! Couldn&#39;t finish the whole thing but I would order it again in a heart beat.Looking forward to coming back for the pancakes!

This was our first stop in Noe Valley and I was truly impressed with the delicious food that we had for lunch. We had a pretty short wait as it was already 130pm in the afternoon and our food arrived quite soon after we ordered. I had the very tasty BLTA - thick slices of bacon on sourdough with tomatoes, lettuce and lots of fresh avocado. I tried my friend&#39;s burger and the grilled chicken Caesar and everything was so juicy and tender and really hit the spot. The fries are perfect - soft on the inside with a crisp exterior.The space is small and cramped inside but this lends to the bustling vibe. A tasty intro to Noe Valley - thumbs up!

LOVE!LOVE!LOOOOOOVE!!when they say souffle pancake they actually mean souffle. lots of places advertise souffle pancakes but fall short (pun intended). at Griddle Fresh the pancakes are super light and airy with just a little crisp on the edge (my favorite part). when you cut into the middle you actually see white like an actual souffle. fantastic! it comes with carmelized bananas, walnuts and some type of sauce along with syrup. GET THIS!the french toast was equally as delicious. verrrry well executed. nice crisp with a custardy center. probably in the top three french toasts ever alongside Nopa&#39;s and Canteen&#39;s. GET THIS TOO!the corned beef hash was pretty good. big chunks of corned beef with potatoes and peppers topped with perfectly poached eggs and a wasabi hollandaise. they serve it with wedge potatoes but i asked for the hash browns instead because they looked so crispy. i&#39;m happy to report that i made the right choice! very crisp thin hashbrowns. yum!canNOT wait to go back. by the looks of it they are quickly gaining notice as i saw a lot of people waiting for tables. service was quick and all tables full, so it must mean they are just busy. good for them!

First things first, parking is a nightmare. It&#39;s the city. It&#39;s expected. You&#39;re also probably going to be behind a couple of groups already on the wait list.My boyfriend and I got a little lucky. After 15 minutes of being behind 6th on the list, we got tired of standing and sat down outside to wait. Little did we know, we could have brunch outside.The waitress came out and asked if we&#39;d like menus, and since it was nice out, we graciously accepted. It was awesome, and even though it was packed inside, we were not neglected :) major brownie points.The food was delicious as well. I&#39;ve never had mascarpone but it went well with the banana pancakes. The pancakes were definitely a dessert dish. We ordered it as a second dish, and the salmon tartine as the first.I love, love, love smoked salmon. I wish they had put a little more on there, along with a fresher avocado, but the aioli went well with the dish. The fries were also perfectly seasoned.The only con is that there were too many people and too little seats. It was a very small place and with its growing popularity, I wish they could be bigger. But it&#39;s understandable.Great food. Great service.

Love to Brunch and shocked that I don&#39;t write reviews more often. These guys put out a great product and seem to do a good job of running through the wait list.Arrive and immediately add your party to the wait list. Once seated the service is moderately quick. Two of us ordered their eggs Benedict, one with crab meat &amp; shrimp and the other was their Parma Flavor I believe it was called. Plus we ordered blueberry pancakes. All 3 dishes arrived within 15 minutes and the kitchen was hopping.The Parma Flavor was the winner. Tomatoes were great, eggs and hollandaise sauce were superb. Mozzarella cheese &amp; ham was tender &amp; wonderful. The hash that came with both is served flat on the plate and is divine - very different from almost anywhere else I&#39;ve brunched. Pancakes were a B, nothing special and the maple syrup wasn&#39;t served warm nor did it taste real.So, I gave them 4 stars, would have preferred 3.5. Service was great so I guess that would be the extra .5.

We waited for two hours and we&#39;re finally seated. I got the Italian omelette or something like that and wasn&#39;t a big fan. The hash browns were really good though and so was the service. They were very fast paced because they&#39;re trying to get people out so they can have the table but I didn&#39;t feel rushed. Overall the service was good but I didn&#39;t enjoy the food and wouldn&#39;t wait another two hours to have it again.

I also got the crispy wedges which I personally felt like they tasted like the ones from kfc. So unfortunately it wasn&#39;t that special.My bf got the French toast &amp; side of crispy hash browns. I really liked how nicely designed bothain dishes were. &amp; the fresh toast was flavorful with a slight crisps &amp; the granola &amp; cornflakes were a perfect touch.

The food is amazing on so many levels! it didn&#39;t affect the experience as much but for my burger i was not asked on how i would like my meat cooked. Also i came with a party of five and i was going to tip above 20 percent but they wrote down the tip for us for less than 20 percent. From where i am from gratuity is for parties of 6 or more so this was the only thing keeping me from writing a 5 star review.

Quaint little brunch spot in sunny Noe Valley. There&#39;s quite a wait but luckily a friend arrived first to snag a spot. Although they&#39;re busy, they don&#39;t rush you to leave.Had the chicken Caesar salad, pancakes, GR burger, salmon Benedict and hash browns. Great texture for each dish - salad was moist, pancakes were fluffy, Benedict had that oozy egg and burger was juicy. I didn&#39;t have OJ but my friends did.Not too pricey. $69 for 3 peeps. Don&#39;t know about the boys but I was stuffed.

My girlfriend and I came for brunch on Saturday. The highlight was the banana mascarpone pancakes which were super soft and sweet. The walnuts were a nice touch. We also orderd the Parma Eggs Benedict which was pretty good - the eggs were overly runny, but tasty nonetheless. Tomatoes were very sweet and seasoned well.If you come on the weekend be prepared to wait at least fifteen to twenty minutes as the restaurant is not that big. Parking is tough, especially if there is a street festival going on.Side note: I was not so happy with two men coming in and cutting us. We noticed they put their name on the wait list ahead of ours in place of someone who had left and crossed their name off. Decided not to say anything as we got seated soon enough.

While I am generally fairly apprehensive about trying new brunch places, I decided to give this one a shot from all their positive reviews. I was PLEASANTLY surprised by the quality and taste of food here.We got:- 6hr corned beef house special: This was AMAZING. I have probably never had better corned beef before. They provided generous chunks of fatty, tender, glorious corned beef. &#39;nuff said.- chorizo jalapeno tartine: The chorizo tartine dish was pretty spectacular as well, but I personally liked the corned beef hash more. Great aioli spread on a very soft and yummy brioche. The only thing the dish is missing is some avocado, which you can order as a side.For not liking wedges, they do a FANTASTIC job with making them seasoned well and crispy. I highly recommend getting these while you&#39;re here. I also got the hash browns which comes in a very thin, crispy layer of deliciousness. Between the wedges and hash browns... tough choice. IMO you must get both! Their fresh squeezed orange juice is damn tasty too and ranks as one of the better fresh squeezed OJs around.The wait on a Saturday afternoon (around 12:30 for 2) was about a half hour wait. Compared to most brunch places, that&#39;s not bad. Great food, great portions, great prices. A bit far for most of SF in terms of commuting, but I think it&#39;s well worth the trek and will probably find myself coming back here soon!

Best (fresh-squeezed) orange juice I&#39;ve ever tasted. Best (house made) breakfast sausage I&#39;ve ever tasted. And the pancakes were certainly in the top 20 percent. Finally, they managed to seat me very quickly for a busy Sunday at noon. Well worth what you pay. Wish I lived near there.

I came on a weekday morning and there was plenty of free residential parking and no wait! I ordered the Frisco omelette with hash browns and it was one of the best breakfasts I&#39;ve had. The omelette was flavorful and came with sausage, cheddar onions, tomato and avocado. I&#39;m usually not a huge fan of omelettes because I don&#39;t like eating too much egg but this one was delicious! The hash browns came in a sheet that covered the whole plate and were super crispy and tasty. Service was great and I can&#39;t wait to return!

Hmm, another brunch place!I took a day off of work (not even sure why now, maybe an appointment or something), or just needed a Friday away, and ended up coming to Griddle Fresh - mostly because the souffle pancakes sounded amazing.Ordered the lemon ricotta souffle pancakes and it was absolutely delicious. So flight and fluffy, but also sweet and really satisfied that sweet tooth of mine. Definitely will have to come back to try some of the other breakfast options, but any of those souffle pancakes are sure to please.

Griddle Fresh is a very nice place! The restaurant is clean and quiet, the service is quick as well. My friends and I went for Sunday brunch and hardly had to wait to get seated. The water carafe was made of plastic but looked glass, which I appreciated. I just hate heavy carafes that you are worried about breaking!The food was great too! The pancakes were a bit too fluffy for me, and are different than any pancake I ever had. However, if you like pancakes a lot I would recommend it.The eggs Benedict was good too, in fact, it was the second best Benedict I ever had, and I have had many a Benedict in my day!Finally, the rustic omelet was phenomenal! I hate eggs but I loved this omelet. It had asparagus in it.One more thing, my friend went to the bathroom and told me it smelled wonderful for a unisex bathroom. It&#39;s safe to pee here.

Absolutely delicious! This place is amazing! I came on a Saturday morning so we had to wait about 15 minutes but it wasn&#39;t too bad. The tables are very very close together so be prepared for that. The food came out relatively quickly and it was quite delicious! Eggs Benedict and a side of hash browns and it was so yummy! If you&#39;re looking for a great brunch place this is for you!

Alright! Here it goes...Griddle Fresh is officially my favorite brunch place in San Francisco. Olea might be tied with it for food, but based on the fact that Griddle Fresh is open for brunch on all days of the week and has ample seating, great service, I would rank it as #1.Came on a Tuesday at 10:30 AM with no wait. Given this place just opened not too long ago, I expect this no wait business to quickly change as it gains more popularity. Super nice wait staff and very attentive.Enough about the details, let&#39;s get to the food.JJ had the 6 Hr Corned Beef Hash (substituted the potato wedges for hashbrowns): If you&#39;re a corned beef lover you will adore this dish. JJ was in heaven! Personally I find corned beef a bit too salty for me, but the fact that it comes with 2 poached eggs and nicely caramelized potatoes and onions made me reach my fork across the table a couple of times to food steal :D.I had the BLT Benedict (Bacon, Spinach Tomato): DELICIOUS. I loved the combination and didn&#39;t find my benedict too heavy. They definitely didn&#39;t skimp on the bacon and I pushed a lot of my bacon off to JJ haha. Comes with a crispy hash brown.We also felt obligated to order a plate of the lemon souffle pancakes given everyone&#39;s rave reviews, and are so glad we did! Holy moly... how do they make pancakes like this?? I spent much of my time trying to deconstruct the pancake to figure out what was making it so fluffly and delicious! Is it the egg whites? The ricotta?? I have had some really good lemon ricotta pancakes in New York, but I think Griddle Fresh&#39;s blows it out of the water.The crispy hashbrowns deserve a little mention all on their own. It&#39;s so refreshing to find a brunch place with a more unique breakfast side. The hashbrown is so thin and crispy and fried to perfection. Perfect with a small dab of ketchup. I would come back just so I can get more, yum yum yum! I am also a big fan of the english muffins they serve here! Thin and lightly browned. It was perfect with the raspberry jam they had on the table.The best part was that we had enough food to bring home two boxes of leftovers. Everything was mighty tasty as a late afternoon snack later in the day, and I savored every bite :)As you can tell, there was nothing I didn&#39;t like about my meal, and I will definitely be back in the near future! I caught a glimpse of some cool specials on my way out like a Meatball Benedict. Can&#39;t wait to bring more of my friends here.

The. Best. Hash. Browns. Ever!Okay, I admit I secretly love McDonald&#39;s oil-dripping hash browns as much as the next fat kid. But Griddle Fresh&#39;s fresh hash browns are the bomb! Okay, they&#39;re basically the same thing as what you&#39;d get at any other diner, but made into a thinner layer and seasoned. That&#39;s it. That&#39;s the secret guys. But the difference it makes!! It eliminates the unseasoned and unfried bits of poor potato hidden in the middle of an average pile of hash brown. Every tiny strip gets to turn golden brown and crispy, and eaten! No potato left behind. And I didn&#39;t even need ketchup.And my side of Smoked Salmon Tartine? Also delicious. Comes with practically one whole avacado on brioche bun.On top of that, service was great-I definitely recommend this place!

How can you not love this place?! Everything I&#39;ve ever had was delicious. Don&#39;t let the wait discourage you it&#39;s definitely worth it.My favorites are the tartines with their super awesome flat and crispy Hashbrowns and the banana mascarpone pancakes.I&#39;ve tried majority of the brunch places in San Francisco and this is still my favorite!Service is also efficient and friendly. Parking in he area isn&#39;t that bad either or maybe I&#39;ve just always been lucky. Thumbs up all around.

My sister and I came here over the weekend and we got there around 9:30am ish? We thought it wasn&#39;t going to be much of a wait but I think we still waited for about 45 minutes. Just FYI parking kinda sucks in that area...in my opinion. The restaurant is pretty small and cramped. We got to our table and they lady gave us the menus. I already had in mind what I wanted b/c I was looking through yelp ahead of time lol. I ordered the strawberry souffle pancakes with an order of fries on the side. My sister ordered Smoked Salmon Tartine with hash browns on the side. We also ordered fresh orange juice. It took quite awhile for the food to come because it was busy but I was super duper hungry. Unfortunately, when my pancakes came out, it was quite burnt. I was going to ask for a new one but I was thinking it&#39;d take longer so I just ate it. It was good but burnt part kind of killed it. :/ I put a lot of syrup on it so the burnt won&#39;t taste as bad lol. My sister&#39;s food was really good. The avocados and the salmon tasted amazing!!Overall, it was a good breakfast except for my burnt pancakes. I definitely will come back to try other things on the menu! :)

If Heaven served pancakes, I&#39;m pretty sure they would be catered from here.PARKING: (because that totally factors into whether you go somewhere or not) There is some street parking (residential), and metered parking on adjacent streets. There are quite a few shops in the area so parking CAN be difficult, we just got lucky after circling a few times.THE WAIT: Came here at 12:50p on a rainy day and waited 35 minutes for a table of 2. The place is pretty small so you&#39;ll likely have to wait.THE FOOD:Lemon Ricotta Souffle Pancakes: 5 stars. YOU MUST GET THIS. The pancake comes in a stack of 3 and in between each layer is fluffy whipped souffle goodness... It is unlike any other pancake I&#39;ve ever had and ridiculously delicious (and I didn&#39;t get tired of it like 4 bites in like I do with regular pancakes!). Even better was the fact that it wasn&#39;t that sweet (if you skip the maple syrup).Corned beef hash: 4 stars. Perfect hash, not too salty, eggs were made perfectly and lots of potatoes to go on the side.Tip:Order a savory dish and a sweet dish and share!Another plus was the food came out super fast! I believe we waited 10-15 minutes to get our food.

Exemplary! This place is delicious and fresh and fabulous. Their salmon tartine is just the best so I don&#39;t think anyone needs to take a menu. You got this.Okay, but say you&#39;ve had fourteen tartines in a row, and you&#39;ve also had the various Benedict offerings and you&#39;re still curious for more? Go for the chicken Caesar salad. Go quickly.Bonus round: I&#39;ve had a nice egg plate here, with those shaved potato kind of hash browns that are just a little brown and just a little salty and just completely perfect.If you just say no to Noe on the weekends, that&#39;s cool, too, because everyone knows that the best time to get brunch at a popular place is definitely weekday o&#39;clock. Luckily, not everyone actually knows that, technically, but as long as we keep this our little secret, you&#39;ll be golden. Like a salmon tartine. Boom! Full circle!

This place is fantastic for brunch. The 6 hrs corned beef was delicious, but a little too salty. It&#39;s fresh big chunks of corned beef served with poached eggs and crispy potato wedges. Based on other reviews, I asked if they could put less salt on the corned beef, but the waitress said it&#39;s already seasoned. We also ordered the smoked salmon tartine which was another good choice. Everything was fresh and tasty. I would definitely order both again. The orders were $13 each, not cheap but not super expensive either. I wanted to try the famous pancakes, but I&#39;ll have to save that for another trip. There was a long wait for a table, probably close to an hour. I walked over to Noe Valley bakery while waiting and bought some macarons. It was a great dessert after the meal.

Food is amazing, service is tip-top for the amount of patrons going in/out, and they also take time to take a group shot for you.Our experience began with the sign-in page. We were behind 21 parties so we decided to get snacks at Noe Valley Bakery and the Farmers Market, while waiting for them to call us. I had enough food and sweets in my system, but still enjoyed their food - that&#39;s how amazing it is. If food is alright, my body would have said &#34;I&#39;m full&#34;, but I wanted to keep eating. Hello Gluttony.The banana marscapone cream pancake was just right to the palette. I had a taste of the salmon tartine, which was ahhhmazing. My friend also gave me a piece of bacon from his two eggs order, and another shared his hash brown. I loved both!! The bacon was nice and hard like how I like it, and the hash browns were more like the top of the hash browns. It was uber crispy and yummy.Definitely worth the wait and try. And definitely easier to get a table if you&#39;re in a party of two. We were a party of five.

Food:Rustic Omelet, Frisco Omelet: Heaven in your mouth. Huge portions. Come hungry. Everything is not too greasy and full of flavor. The Frisco comes with so much guacamole. Remember to use the jam for the toast! The jam is gold.French Toast, Banana Souffle Pancake: So sweet and so fluffy. Also huge portions. For me, it doesn&#39;t need any more syrup but add away!Service: Friendly and attentive staff. Don&#39;t be afraid to ask for substitutions.Atmosphere: Cozy and pleasant. Good for big and small groups. I came on a weekday 11am, which was not busy at all. Good for casual, yet impressive brunch date.I would come back and get the exact same thing.

Came here to grab brunch with my brunch pal about a week or two ago. This was both of our first times here and we ordered the strawberry pancake and I ordered the roast beef I believe?? Everything arrived and looked really amazing. The pancakes tasted alright compared to its look. My friend and I both agreed it was too fluffy for a pancake and it was too easy to break apart and bouncy texture??? And roasted beef was delicious though and I enjoyed the wedges very much. Beef had a lot of flavor to it and the potatoes that accompanied it was very good as well. I think the pancake really disappointed the both of us or not what we had expected~

Can I just say that brunch is basically the meaning of life? And that Griddle Fresh knows this very well. LITERALLY THE GREATEST MOST SPECTACULARLY DELICIOUS BRUNCH OF MY LIFE. I love this place. I came here on a Sunday for brunch with a friend. There was about a 20 minute wait before we were seated, but it wasn&#39;t too bad. The restaurant was packed though and it was around 11:30 am so be prepared for a wait if you come on the weekends. I ordered the smoked salmon tartine and green tea. Wow. JUST WOW. I wasn&#39;t sure what a tartine was at first so I googled it, but its basically a fancy open face sandwich. So there were eggs topped with smoked salmon, a creamy white sauce, onions and some other greens. There was also a layer of avocado between the eggs and the bread. But GOSH. literally the eggs were the softest and fluffiest eggs I&#39;ve ever had. The sauce added a perfect creamy touch to the whole dish. The combination of the smoked salmon and avocado and eggs and sauce and everything was just perfection. The portions were very hefty as well. I also had potato wedges on the side and they were perfect. Sometimes you go to a restaurant and the wedges are soggy or not flavorful -- not the case with these wedges. These wedges were expertly crafted, had the perfect amount of crispiness and just the right amount of flavor. I didn&#39;t even bother putting ketchup on them or adding extra salt or pepper. Overall everything was delicious. The prices range from $10-$20 depending on what you order. I want to live in this restaurant and eat brunch here for the rest of my life. Forever.

My favorite time of day is brunch, and Griddle Fresh was calling my name. Or more like screaming it loudly at the top of its lungs. I was so excited when I discovered this little gem, and I knew I had to try it ASAP.I came here with the bf on a rainy Saturday around 2pm and drove around forever trying to find street parking. It was surprising that so many people were out that day. We got to the restaurant around 2:20pm, and we were seated within 10 minutes, so all was good.I ordered the smoked salmon tartine, which was just delicious. Call my cheesy, but I&#39;d say it was like sunshine on a plate. It consisted of a brioche bun topped with a light cream cheese, avocado, fluffy scrambled egg with chives, thick slices of smoked salmon, and sprouts. It came with a side of potato wedges, which were crispy and seasoned perfectly.The bf ordered the parma flavor eggs benedict. It had generous slices of prosciutto, mozzarella, tomato, asparagus, and a poached egg with a chive hollandaise. It was presented beautifully, but overall, it seemed like a pretty standard benedict. It came with hashbrowns, but it wasn&#39;t as big of a portion as other people&#39;s pictures. It was nice and crispy, but the bf would&#39;ve been happier if he had a bigger serving of it.The highlight of this breakfast was the banana souffle pancakes. It was love at first bite. It was the perfect portion for the two of us, and we were able to finish it all, along with our own main dishes. The pancakes were so fluffy and slightly creamy, almost with the consistency of marshmallows. They were topped with a macadamia nut sauce, which added a touch of sweetness. I&#39;ve never had anything like it. They were delightful, and I wish I could get them delivered to me in bed right now.I was so happy with my breakfast that I inhaled my whole meal, which really never happens. I&#39;m the type of girl that always brings home leftovers. Everything was so light, but oh-so-satisifying, and I can&#39;t wait to go back to try some of the other items on their menu.

I LOVE this place. I&#39;ve only been here a couple of times, but each experience has been a great one! The food here is amazing! Upon walking in and seeing food being delivered to tables, you&#39;re already wondering what you should order; it all looks so good! The Savory Reggiano French Toast was deeeeelightful! The salad it came with was tossed with the perrfect amount of dressing. I&#39;ve had a bite of the Parma Benedict. That was good too. I&#39;ve tried the herbed fried chicken. Omg. I&#39;m salivating thinking about it. The salmon cakes Benedict I ordered were amazing as well. You cannot go wrong with their menu selection! Matcha Green Tea Latte was good too. I can&#39;t wait to come back and try more of the menu!

Advice: Have someone get out the car and put down your names before you circle around that half hour to find parking. You&#39;ll definitely have enough time and not get skipped over.Came here on a Saturday for brunch, and after putting my name down, it took an hour before my name was called. Luckily, I killed the perfect amount of time before returning.I ordered the Banana Mascarpone Souffle Pancake and my oh my, definitely the best pancakes I&#39;ve ever had! AND, THEY&#39;RE SO FLUFFFFLLLYY!!!! *Said in the voice of Candice from Despicable Me* Every bite was absolutely delicious!Babe got the Salmon Cakes and it was just as amazing! The hashbrowns were crispy to perfection. The spinach added the extra umph to the flavor and the entire dish was absolutely delicious.I would LOVE to frequent Griddle Fresh if it weren&#39;t for the lines. But hey, they have lines for a reason. And a plus, the food comes out quite fast as compared to other places. So thats a thumbs up. They probably know how long we have to wait for their food and don&#39;t want to deal with hangry customers. ;)

Insanely delicious!!! The worst part about this place is making an actual selection as each item sounds incredible. Our group ordered the frisco and tex-mex omelette a and a pork egg burger.

Gave this place a second chance and came back recently right when they opened. Food is still delicious and service was much or way better than the first time I came. Big improvement and I left happy except for my wallet (because spent about $70 for breakfast for two, which was tip included, two meals and one bottomless mimosa).

I suggest you come here with a friend, get the pancakes and another savory dish and split it so you can try a little bit of everything. definitely one of the best brunch places in the city. I want to come back to try the french toast!

All I can still taste is the fluffy, warm goodness of those Banana Souffle mascapone pancakes. For $12, you get amazing on a plate for breakfast. I can&#39;t help but love how light and delightfully done these pancakes are. It&#39;s a delightful twist on traditional pancakes. The glazed bananas and walnuts on top complemented the pancakes very well. You could vary up your sweetness by dumping (or not) as much syrup as you&#39;d like on it.Logistics:-PARKING: Street (Metered) or Free in the neighborhood. Parking isn&#39;t too bad if you&#39;re willing to parallel park and maybe circle around a few times in the heavy peak times.-WAIT TIME: 2pm on a Sunday afternoon right before closing = about a 15 minute wait, which was what the lady quoted as &#34;fast&#34;. It&#39;s a pretty small place - probably sits about 30 ish people. Not too friendly for large groups.-FOOD WAIT TIME: Food out in about ~15 minutes when the place was dying down.I can&#39;t wait to come back here again for more pancakes! I think I&#39;ll be having dreams about this place for awhile. If you come for anything, please come for the pancakes!

Food is great here! My favorites: 6hr corned beef hash, salmon cake benedict with hashbrowns and banana mascarpone pancakes... So far. I&#39;ve tried the salmon Tartine but wasn&#39;t a huge fan since the salmon was more of a lox-type it was pretty fishy. The hashbrown lives up to the hype. It&#39;s thin, crispy and deliciously deadly. There is usually always a wait here, especially if you&#39;re dining with other people. I get my orders to go since I work in the neighborhood. The food is usually made pretty quick for to-go orders.

Such a good brunch. I&#39;m still reeling from the deliciousness of it all.I&#39;d come here just for the:A) $12 souffle mascarpone banana pancakes. Please cut this even if pancakes aren&#39;t your thing. This baby is magical.B) $11 French toast. Soft delicious middle couples with yumyum toasty outside.Both are served up until about 2pm or so, so come here early(ish!)We also got hashbrowns? that came out like a green onion pancake. Also would recommend, though it&#39;s much less potatoy than your typical hashWe waited about 20 minutes on Black Friday around 1pm? Not too bad of a wait, though I&#39;d imagine the small venue would be crowded on a normal day.Only downside was one of the waitresses.. she seriously death glared us every time we added something to our order.

Hubby and I FINALLY were able to come here for brunch this past Sunday! Wait time... 45 minutes for a table of two. By the time we sat down, my arse was starving. Anyway, interior of the restuarant is quite small. Maybe holds about 10-12 tables? What&#39;s cool is that it&#39;s a semi open kitchen. So you can peek through to see them make your food.Now let&#39;s see... what we ordered:Frisco omelette and the 6 hour corned beef hash. Frisco omelette had chicken apple sausage, diced tomatoes, cheddar cheese, with sliced avocado atop. All of this was sitting over the crispy golden hashbrowns that were pan fried to perfection. You can opt to sub for fresh fruit, but it does already come with a slice of cantelope.The 6 hour corned beef has was potato overload, but oh so worth it! The corned beef was chucks of tender tenderness that was oh so juicy! It came with potatoes as the hash and then delish fried potato wedges. My only gripe, not enough corned beef!Next time we come here, we&#39;re definetely trying the lemon souffle pancakes. The table behind us ordered it and it looked so fluffy and scrumptious!

I love moseying down this dog-friendly street of Noe Valley on weekends but there simply isn&#39;t any good brunch places... until Griddle Fresh came along. It is the little sister restaurant to Mymy Coffee shop, so similar menus and my, my is it scrumptious!Ooey gooey French Toast- They were going for a creme brulee feel, so there was caramel cream along with some vanilla mascarpone and blueberry jam intertwined. They also offered a jar of jam on the side. But what I really liked about the french toast was it was littered with vanilla granola and different types of nuts!Banana Mascarpone Souffle Pancakes - You wouldn&#39;t think one could stuff so much mascarpone into a thin pancake, but oh, they did! (The mascarpone was stuffed in the middle of the pancake where there was more space as opposed to the edges.) The pancakes were so airy with layers of mascarpone in between the 3 pancakes; it tasted like a light, layered mousse cake. The candied walnuts and syrup were the icing on top of the cake!6 hour corned beef hash - The thick chunks of corned beef were melt-in-your-mouth and had just the right amount of fat. The country potatoes they sat on top of were very soggy from the moisture and retained this thick, gummy skin which was very inedible. The potato wedges on the side, though, were crisp and well-seasoned. The poached eggs were okay; one of the yolks was overcooked.The service was attentive, particularly because we were the only ones in the restaurant. Our waitress was so polite and was prompt in bringing us a jar of jam, condiments, and water. What a great addition to this neck of the woods! Other folks were peeping in the window and reading the new menu in addition to salivating over our dishes. I would definitely come back for more pancakes - I&#39;ve had mascarpone and ricotta pancakes before but never ones like these.

The only reason this place is getting 2 stars is.....I&#39;m not sure, oh the souffle pancakes that the table shared.A couple of observations made:5 tables sat before us which were after us on the waiting list. Why even have a waiting list if you aren&#39;t going to use it?Giving tables the wrong bill.Giving a guy a bill when he already paid.Apologizing after the meal for the wait, nothing comped for the inconvenience.The 6 hr cornbeef was super salty and this dish had no bell peppers or onions as listed on the menu. But it had so mant potatoes it was definitely a carb plate. Why serve it with French fries when it already has potatoes mixed with the cornbeef? Chef please enlighten me.After getting raves from my friend who wanted to go, she was right about the souffle pancakes but the service was atrocious. Did I mention it&#39;s her birthday week? Thumbs down.

I was really interested in eating breakfast at this restaurant in Noe Valley because of the response on Yelp. However, I had the Florentine eggs benedict and was not satisfied by the meal. For a place that specializes in breakfast, I noticed the eggs I had and that my friend had had raw egg white dripping from it. I have never experienced raw egg whites for breakfast at a restaurant. I was not completely full from my meal and it was a little expensive. This is not a cheap place to get breakfast. The experience wasn&#39;t that good. The worker wasn&#39;t sweet or cheerful...not very hospitable. Check out Chloe&#39;s down the street for a more delightful menu and experience.

Tough to go wrong unless you order the fried chicken. Pancakes, Benedicts, scrambed eggs are all yummy. The wait time can be long so consider ordering ahead.

This is by far my favorite breakfast place in the city! Everything that I have tried has been amazing! The only thing that I dislike is that the wait is always at least 40 min. But once you taste the food its worth it!

We shared an order of the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes and a pork scramble. The pancakes are fluffy (like it&#39;s injected with air) and light, with a hint of sweetness. The pork scramble is filing, bursting with flavors of spice, heat, and kick. The only part of our wonderful meal that I would say needs improvement is the coffee, which is burnt and bitter.The seating is a bit tight. Parties of four or less should be okay, even on weekends.Griddle Fresh is an amazing breakfast restaurant!

If I could, 3.5 stars. I started going here after my baby and I was craving more protein during the day. They have a nice burger menu. There is one burger with fried onion strings on it that is super-yummy and a couple others I want to try. Pulled pork burger? Can&#39;t wait. Yummy fries and potato wedges at brunch although borderline salty.At brunch they have a nice benedict menu. The seafood one with red pepper hollandaise was tasty. 6hr Corned Beef is the bomb if you&#39;re into that kind of thing. Noe Valley really needed a diner-ish type place (other than Toast!) with variety and fun choices. Yet... to be realistic the food is just okay. Not mind-blowing. Not San Francisco celebrity chef. But, it&#39;s pretty and fun and more than edible. The reason the food is not mindblowing is not for lack of creativity but it&#39;s because they&#39;re not using top of the line produce, meats and cheese. But, of course, this is how they can keep their prices lower than other places in a city with astronomical rents and standard of living. You can&#39;t have everything...I am a fan of the burgers and benedicts but their other specialty pancakes not so much. I wish they had regular buttermilk pancakes instead of the souffle kind as I don&#39;t like things that taste, as one reviewer put it, &#34;gelatinous.&#34; They are not that bad though if you like that kind of thing (my husband) and they give you nice fresh fruit and compote with most pancake orders. What I&#39;m pleased most about is the service. The people who work here are not overly chatty and hipster, but they know how to work in a restaurant, take your order and serve you. They are friendly enough for service people--they are not trying to get on food network or sell you a t-shirt to raise money for their food truck. I&#39;ve come in a few times with my baby (along with the rest of Noe Valley) and they are very accommodating to baby&#39;s an parents--in Noe you HAVE to be.Solid choice for benedicts and burgers. Great selection. Nice staff. Baby-friendly! Will go back to further explore menu (except pancakes).

Griddle fresh is one of my new fave brunch spots. Their service is not very up to par, but their food is. We&#39;ve had the 6 hr cooked corned beef hash, lemon souffle pancakes, banana marscarpone pancakes, and the sea board benedict. Corned beef hash was delicious; chunks of meat with potatoes in a gravy topped with an egg and a dallop of dill creme served with potato wedges. Some of my friends said they didn&#39;t like it solely on the fact that they expected it to be more of a corned beef hash and not large chunks of diced meat. The pancakes are sooooo light and fluffy and feels like you&#39;re eating a cloud. Ever seen the episode where Homer Simpson is floating in the sky amongst the clouds eating a donut with his eyes closed? Yep, imagine that. If you can&#39;t choose between the lemon or the banana, choose the banana!Get here by 10am or you&#39;ll be waiting and staring at the people eating at the window.

I&#39;ve been to Griddle Fresh a couple times now. And every time I think to myself the food is well worth the wait.I love how they flatten the hash brown, so crunchy and yummy.Egg benedict is always my favorite, but I tried the Big Papa burger last time and it was also amazing: everything just melted in my mouth.The reason I took away one of their stars is because their BBQ chicken wings special was kind of odd. Too sweet and not very crispy as I would prefer.But I&#39;m open to update my review when I get to try their other specials in the future.Overall, this is where I bring all my friends when we want brunch

My boyfriend and I came late early one weekday and there was no wait at all! We ordered the french toast, banana marscapone pancakes, a salmon Benedict, and the rustic omlette. The marscapone pancakes had a really good fluffy texture but the marscapone taste was sooo overpowering we ended up not really eating it. The French toast was really good. It came with a cream and berry sauce on the side and candied granola that was delicious! Too bad we only ordered a kids size which only came with one tiny piece. My boyfriend enjoyed the salmon Benedict. And my rustic omlette was kind of disappointing. The eggs were obviously not fresh eggs as in I could tell they were powdered or some sort of liquid eggs out of a carton. The eggs were really hard and dry, so I ended up picking all the veggies out of the omlette. The hash browns were super super thin. Almost like a potato chip. Maybe it was just a hit or miss. I would definitely give this place another try if I&#39;m ever in the area, but would probably try something else.

Solid Noe Valley brunch spot. Packed on weekends, getting a table is much easier on weekdays. It&#39;s $2-$4 more than your average diner fare, but this isn&#39;t average. The scrambles and omelette are huge, beautiful, and come with perfectly crisped hash browns. The pancake section is fancy schmancy (banana marscapone pancakes), but they will serve you straight up buttermilk with real maple syrup if you ask.Pro-tip: there&#39;s a dish on the back called the &#34;gluten-free special&#34;. It&#39;s really just hash brows with veggies and cheese, but sub the bacon for sausage, add 2 eggs and coffee and you have a gorgeous breakfast for under $15.Service is swift and polite. Didn&#39;t give 5 stars b/c the coffee is just ok and definitely not worth $2.50.

Went here for breakfast/brunch around 11am-Noon. It was still fairly busy and had to wait about 30 minutes for a table for two. It was definitely worth the wait. The food was delicious. I had the SF omelette. The other person I dined with ordered pancakes which came with fresh fruit. The portions are very large and neither of us finished our plate. The area is also nice to walk around in before or after dining. Only giving 4 stars because I was a bit weirded out by the jam and cream that just sit on the tables all day...umm... refrigeration?? Other than that, I highly recommend to anyone.

It&#39;s small and there might be a wait but it&#39;s worth it. Service is a bit slow but the ladies are very sweet!

This was the best breakfast/brunch I have ever had in SF. I waited a really long darn time to get a table for it, and I am a very impatient person when hungry, but it was worth it. The pulled pork omelet I had was so delicious. I shared some french toast with my husband as well. I usually don&#39;t like french toast because I find it too dessert-y, but this one had a good balance going on. Service is fast and efficient here. This is going to be a dining stop on every future trip I make to SF for sure.

Definitely my favorite brunch place in SF (yes, I think it&#39;s better than Mama&#39;s, or Mission beach cafe, or Zazie, or Plow)I always always get the banana mascarpone pancakes, an absolute MUST if you come. Pancakes are stuffed with mascarpone cheese and are the fluffiest ever.My fav benedict is the BLT benedict. Not a huge fan of the pam farm, I thought it was pretty bland.The tartines are really good too. They make their eggs super fluffy, along with crispy and perfect harsh brown.Wait can be long on the weekends tho, esp if you have a big group

OK OK, easily my favorite brunch spot in the city.My friends and I came here on a Sunday afternoon and we were seated right away. I do believe that they are usually packed, as with typical brunch places. I don&#39;t remember exactly what my friends ordered, but I do remember everything being REALLY delicious!I ordered the Florentine Benedict, which had with mushrooms, spinach, tomatoes and some gooey yummy hollandaise sauce. It came with a side of flatten hash browns, which paired well with my eggs benedict. Other brunch places usually serve eggs benedict with potatoes, but Griddle Fresh&#39;s crunchy hash browns were not too overwhelming.I also took a few bites of my friend&#39;s Banana Mascarpone Souffle Pancakes, and holy moly.. it was probably one of the most ingenious ideas ever created in the breakfast world. The pancakes were stuffed with vanilla? topped with bananas and walnuts with a side of maple syrup JUST TRUST ME, try it. I&#39;m usually not a fan of bananas, but those pancakes were A+.I&#39;m drooling as I&#39;m writing this review, so I&#39;m going to have to end it here. Can&#39;t wait to come back and try the Lemon Ricotta Souffle Pancakes!

Fortunately (or unfortunately, per my diet) I live around the corner from Griddle Fresh. Every time I&#39;ve gone here they have had reliable quality of food and service, though the wait can be up to an hour for brunch on the weekends.They are only open during breakfast/brunch hours, and rightfully so. They know what they do well and they do it amazing.The three most popular things here are as follows:1. Exotically sweet and decadent pancakes (often stuffed).2. Benedicts.3. Tartines.I&#39;ve tried just about their whole menu, but of the things I&#39;ve tried in the categories above, these are my favorite:1. Lemon Ricotta stuffed pancakes.2. Seaboard Benedict (I am a seafood lover, obv).3. Smoked Salmon Tartine,TIp:Try the Latte Plus. It&#39;s different, but it&#39;s good. It&#39;s like a hot cereal with coffee. I think the owners may be Korean, because it closely resembles Misugaru.

I&#39;m not a big breakfast fan but if this was how breakfast was made all the time you bet I would eat it every day.Between 3 people we ordered 3 plates of food and an extra order of bacon. I now regret not ordering an extra order of hashbrowns because they were so good and so crispy! Like chips.The Sea Board Benedict had fresh crab and sauteed shrimp which was not fishy at all. It also laid on top of the best english muffin I&#39;ve ever eaten. I wonder if they make it in house or which bakery they get it from.... I want a bag for myself...6 Hour Corned Beef just melts in your mouth. So good! And when eaten with the hashbroads and the additional potatoes they are made with... what kind of breakfast could be better than meat and potatoes for breakfast.The lemon ricotta souffle pancakes were super fluffy and light. This was the perfect not too sweet not to dense way to end a very filling breakfast.Well worth the wait.

Food was good. My friend raved about the lemon pancakes so i came just for those. I was a bit disappointed. Not lemony enough and not a fan of the egg whites not being incorporated into the flour. Also got the eggs benedict with prosciutto and they were delicious. I am usually not a fan of hash browns but these were light and crispy and really tasty. The food was all really fresh and unique and came out in a hurry.The service was lacking. Our coffee and water were never refilled and we had to flag the waitress down for everything.Super loud so don&#39;t come for conversation.

Like most of the reviewers, I sincerely enjoyed Griddle Fresh. The food really is as good (if not better) than the pictures portray, and proved worth the wait. Do expect to wait, though. There were two of us arriving on a Monday morning around 11:00, and I think we got seating around noon. The food was worth it, but don&#39;t be surprised if you aren&#39;t seated right away. The place is very small, and the staff is short, though they work extremely hard and efficiently.Pros: I don&#39;t think there is an item on the menu that I wouldn&#39;t have ordered. The prices are reasonable. The service (for being so busy/short on staff) was good. It&#39;s also located in a neat little neighborhood, and parking was easy.Cons: You will most likely wait. Due to cramped quarters, you will also most likely be very close to the table next to you.

This is one of our favorite breakfast places to visit early in the morning on weekends. My favorite is the 6 Hour Hash and I sub the wedges with fruit because you already get potatoes, you don&#39;t need a double-triple serving of potatoes early in the morning.My husband has ordered omelettes and the eggs benedict and liked both. Their hash looked odd to me the first time, but is possibly the best hash I&#39;ve had because it&#39;s crispy on top, never burnt and never greasy. I find their homemade(?) jam too sweet, BUT if you combine it with butter on toast -- heaven.With great difficulty and reluctance, I didn&#39;t order the 6hr hash the last time I went in and decided to try the Banana Souffle Pancakes with a pork patty sausage on the side. I&#39;m not a huge pancake fan, so I was more than pleasantly surprised with how fluffy and airy they got these pancakes -- I guess the souffle bit isn&#39;t just fluff -- and I would order these again. The candied walnuts were a little too sweet for me -- so sugary some of them were clumped together and definitely not going to fall apart, but it still didn&#39;t detract from the dish.Coffee is average. Service is good and can go down a little when very crowded, but the people who work there are incredibly nice, so we never feel ignored when it gets busy.

This was my favorite meal out of the ones I&#39;ve had during the week I was in the city. The souffle pancake, despite its mainstreamness on Yelp, is a must try. I ordered the homemade sausage patty on the side to go with it and it turned out to be a great decision as the saltiness of the sausage really balanced out the sweetness of the pancakes.The only thing that wasn&#39;t great was the service as I was the only one there early on a weekday and didn&#39;t get as much attention (you know, water refill kind of stuff) as I expected. It wasn&#39;t by any means bad though that it took away from the food.

I&#39;ve been here twice already, so I think it&#39;s safe to write a review. I work nearby, so I&#39;ve gotten take out for lunch. I&#39;ve had the pulled pork sandwich and the smoked salmon tartine. Both were very good and presented very well. I&#39;m a big fan of food presentation. The pulled pork was marinated in a very smoky bbq sauce which was delicious. The salmon tartine incorporated both &#34;breakfast&#34; and &#34;lunch&#34;. It was an open faced sandwich with a soft scrambled egg, smoked salmon, and a yogurt dip which was delicious as well. Both came with sides--a salad or potato wedges and a slice of cantalope.It is a tiny bit on the expensive side to be eating here for lunch everyday, but overall worth it for the amount you&#39;re paying and the portion you receive. I think it&#39;s a great place to catch up with a friend over lunch or grab some weekend brunch. Judging by the hoards of people on the sidewalk waiting for Toast on Saturday &amp; Sunday mornings, I don&#39;t think many people know about this place yet since it just opened. But that&#39;s a good thing for me. No wait!

I really do think this is a hidden breakfast gem in San Francisco. It is easy to miss this place in the Noe Valley with so many great restaurants nearby.Tried this place for the first time today and I gotta say, I&#39;m pretty impressed! I took a the advice of my fellow yelpers and ordered the banana mascarpone souffle pancakes and they were DELICIOUS. Melt in your mouth with every bite kind of delicious. You do not even need to drizzle the maple syrup on top.I ordered the garden scramble. It is nothing like what you would expect from a veggie scramble, it was well seasoned (everything was well seasoned) and loaded with veggies. I recommend getting this with their english muffin :)I forced my significant other to order the 6 hr corn beef hash and he enjoyed it a lot, it is very different from your ordinary plate of corn beef hash. Their meat is chunkier and it comes with whole pieces of potatoes.It is a little pricey for breakfast, but totally worth it. I would definitely come back and recommend all my friends here.

Lessons learned:1) There are no cabs in SF2) They are expensive3) Always go with your first instinct!Something told me that I should get the 6 hour corned beef hash. I was in a savory mood anyway. But, after reading about the delightful souffle pancakes I made a switch... Well before that, I asked if I could do a half stack of the pancakes with my hash. Hello, customers like customization, and I only had one brunch during my time in SF so I wanted to get everything. I guess the other option was just to be a fatty and order both full orders... I digress.Anyway, a few minutes later the fluffy &#34;pancakes&#34; are in front of me. The first couple of bites were admittedly pretty good, soft is an understatement for these cakes. BUT, then the rest of the pancake was basically like a fluffy scrambled egg white with syrup... yeah, exactly... I was really not feeling it. I would definitely come back to try another dish next time I&#39;m on the left coast.

I am definitely a breakfast person always looking for new brunch places to noms at. Seeing Griddle Fresh posts on Instagram all the time, why not? Came here on a rainy Sunday (THANK GOD FOR THE RAIN &#39;cause there was no wait) Was seated right away, looked over at the sweets breakfast and made my decision. Being a pancake lover, I ordered the Banana Mascarpone Souffle pancake and the boyfriend got the 6hr Corn beef hash. BOTH were excellent! I couldn&#39;t stop eating. The softness of the pancake, mmmmmmmmms. The crispiness of the potatoes, mmmmmmmmmmms. Heard the Smoked Salmon Tartine was delicious so that is definitely on my to try list when I come back! If you don&#39;t like your pancakes on the really fluffy side, I suggest trying something else on their menu or just getting regular pancakes!

My girlfriend got the Tex-Mex Scramble with white toast she thought it was pretty good a little bit on the spicier side for her though.

It&#39;s not that this place is bad, it&#39;s just that there are so many good places to eat in Noe that it doesn&#39;t stand out.You&#39;ll wait a shorter time here since they have lots of tables but the food is nothing special and depending on where you sit you might get stuck by a door or one of the plastic windows and freeze.

The lemon ricotta souffle pancakes were awesome!!! I also shared the new salmon cake eggs benedict dish.... ugh... it was so good. I wish I could eat it right now. The hash browns were so nice and crispy and the hollandaise sauce was perfectly flavored with lemon and dill for the salmon cake - which was not fishy at all. The best part was the service. The girls that were working here were so sweet and took great care of us on a busy Saturday. This place is WAY better than Mission Beach Cafe (so overrated).

This place is awesome! Believe me, I am very picky about breakfast. I had the pulled pork scramble, and it was delicious. Service was also friendly and prompt. Now, granted, this was not a busy time when I went there. Highly recommended.

Amazing brunch. There was a line outside when we arrived at around midday on a Sunday but we only waited about 15mins. The eggs Benedict was delicious. I had the BLT. I want to try them all! We also shared the lemon ricotta pancakes to see what all the fuss was about. Amazing!!! I will definitely be coming back here.

The service was a bit slow but they were packed to the brim so I waited quite a bit, but beyond that the food was delicious. Crispy potatoes wedges especially are a nice touch, I usually hate potatoes wedges but this was good.I like the restaurant itself. The wall is beautiful with painting frames that match the walls creating an affect that the objects on the wall is especially framed just as they are objects on the wall.

Omg! Everyone at our table exclaimed that the lemon ricotta pancakes were the best pancakes of their life and the rest of the breakfast food was extremely filling and delicious (can you say GIGANTIC FRUIT BOWL??), very very satisfied and would go back tomorrow if I lived closer :(

I&#39;m a huge fan of breakfast food and I was out with the fiance checking some new places. We ordered:- banana pancakes, 3 stacks, had some sort of marshmallow/creme filling, and walnuts = delicious- hashed browns and scrambled eggs = made how I liked it, nothing crazy.- latte plus = not my kind of coffee.- pulled pork scramble = I took a couple of bites and it was good. Slightly plain for me b/c I&#39;m used to having pulled pork with BBQ sauce.Great service, great food.

One of my favorite breakfast places in the whole city.I&#39;m all about finding places with great Eggs Benedict and Griddle Fresh offers that in abundance. Not only is there a whole bunch of choices but they are all pretty unique. Since I&#39;m a boring fart at times I usually just get the Original Benedict but have tried the others and they are all very nice. I love the fact they make a bed of hash browns for your Benedict to sit on.I&#39;ve also tried their Corned Beef Hash which is another great dish. The beef is moist and soft, the &#34;fries&#34; are great, and the sauce on the eggs is delightful. Not as great as the Benedicts but still a very good dish.Service is usually great but of course it&#39;s a popular place so there is only so much they can do. You can expect about a 30 minute wait to get a table but my method is usually just getting take out and going to the park. It&#39;s normally only a 10 minute wait that way.

i love brunch so i automatically wanted to try it and it was so easy to fall in love with it too! it gets pretty busy and shuts down their kitchen for brunch at like 2pm ( or 3pm I forgot ). But really small place so big crowds are not recommended. We waited for like an hour or so at 12pm.I&#39;ve tried the banana mascarpone pancakes and those were so good. Really fluffy and had the texture of a souffle. Loved it! Also tried the lemon ricotta pancakes which were just as good and more lighter than the banana ones. The strawberry and lemon were a good combination and had more flavors than the banana one. Both I recommend though!Also tried the corn beef hash which was great. Normally, not a huge fan of corn beef but I really enjoyed this! You definitely need the bread/potato wedges/starches that it comes with because the corn beef has so much flavor. Very hearty meal! Huge serving, it&#39;ll last me like two meals.I don&#39;t know how else to explain it but it&#39;s really flavorful and enjoyable, worth trying! At first I was hesitant to get wedges but they make it sooo well, just the right amount of crisp! The hash browns were also good but they are thin, so if you want something less carby it&#39;s a good alternative.Always leave feeling satisfied!

This place is really good, once you get past the old man breath odor that greets you at the front door.Tip: The waiting list can be long, but people tend to drop off so you can still get in pretty quickly. If you happen to step away before getting seated, check to see if they already called your name and let them know you&#39;re back, because they will keep going down the list if they did. There will be a &#39;c&#39; next to your name.

Hell hath no fury like a fat kid scorned.Let me set the record straight: on a Sunday morning anywhere in the city, I absolutely expect to wait for any sort of decent brunch in excess of an hour. I was prepared for that wait when my husband and I drove over from Civic Center at our last stay in the city to try this place out, as it was recommended by a friend.The place was clearly crowded and we put our name on the clipboard for two. We were told it would be approximately an hour or perhaps even more. It wouldn&#39;t be the worst thing in the world, so my husband and I sat down and prepared to wait, afraid that if we walked away, we&#39;d miss our name being called.45 minutes into the wait, a couple finishes up outside and the hostess pops out, without even looking at the clipboard, and says &#34;who wouldn&#39;t mind sitting outside?&#34; Mind you, it wasn&#39;t even close to being cold outside, and I seriously doubt anyone that had been waiting would have turned down the table outside. Two people who arrived long after us shout &#34;we wouldn&#39;t!&#34; before we even had a chance to utter the words. The waitress happily and immediately seats them at the table. So I go inside to look at the list and see that couple was FIVE names below us on the list.When I confronted the waitress, she said &#34;I didn&#39;t know. I&#39;m sorry.&#34; and didn&#39;t stop what she was doing.It was not a matter of her not knowing. She just couldn&#39;t be bothered to check the LIST for the busy brunch place she worked at.I stormed out and I will never give this place another try. It will come highly unrecommended by me.

A friend and I split two entrees here: the eggs benedict and lemon souflee pancakes.The eggs were done nicely and came with a side of thin, lacy hash browns.The pancakes were so good we ordered a second serving. They are stuffed with a creamy, heavenly sauce and topped with strawberries (though not enough). Delightful. I also had a soy latte that was pleasant but unexceptional--very mild-tasting.Pros:+ Friendly service, and they were nice about letting us bring strollers in.+ The table is stocked with jam and two kinds of hot sauces.+ It was very clean.+ Overall, the food is high-quality and a cut above most breakfast spots. This is not a hash-slinging kind of establishment.Cons:+ Small portions.+ Absolutely no vegan options, so I succumbed to hunger and went lacto-ovo for this outing. Oh please, Griddle Fresh, won&#39;t you offer a simple tofu scramble so I can come back?

Came here for Sunday brunch and the place was packed! It took us about 45 minutes before we got seated for a group of 5. It was all our first times and we were starving so we were pretty excited to eat at a 4.5 star breakfast joint. I had the Parma Eggs Benedict and the hash brown being so thin made it so crispy and delicious! The prosciutto&#39;s taste was masked by the flavor of everything on the benedict, but when eating it alone, it was delicious. It was good, but not enough to make me go &#34;OMG I MUST COME BACK&#34;. I also shared the lemon souffle pancake with everyone at the table, and that is probably one of the best pancakes I have ever had! I am usually not a fan of pancakes, but this one was so soft and the egg whites in between was so perfect with the strawberry and lemon flavor :) I definitely want to return and try the banana souffle pancake! My boyfriend had the house special&#39;s eggs sandwich and he really enjoyed it. I mostly liked his french fries which were large cuts and super flavorful! My friend had the 6hours corn beef hash and was a fan of it too, so I&#39;m glad my party was happy in the end. I will definitely be back on a less busy day to try their other popular pancake choice :)

I didn&#39;t believe my friend that there was a new brunch place in Noe Valley. Indeed there is. We waited about 5 min to get a table and our food came out right away. They have a no nonsense attitude. I got eggs and potatoes. The potatoes were super crispy. My friend was about to flip out if they didn&#39;t let her order off the kids menu, and they let her. Not a bad choice for brunch.

I&#39;m pretty sure Griddle Fresh is my new favorite brunch spot. Here&#39;s to hoping it stays relatively undiscovered (not likely thanks to all the great Yelp reviews, this one included).Came her with a friend around 11:30 on a Saturday morning and was pleasantly surprised to discover the wait time was only 20 minutes. After experiencing 1-2 hour waits at places like Brenda&#39;s and Sweet Maple, and considering brunch is now San Francisco&#39;s &#34;it&#34; thing, 20 minutes was nothing. And after 20 minutes, we were seated and enjoying Griddle Fresh&#39;s cozy and quaint interior,We ordered the banana walnut marscapone souffle pancakes and the smoked salmon tartine to share. Both were AMAZING. The pancakes were literally the best pancakes I have ever had. They were super light and fluffy and not super sweet, which I really liked because I&#39;m more of a savory girl. And the candied walnuts were great. The smoked salmon tartine is probably my new favorite breakfast item. It&#39;s basically a thin piece of bread--good bread, not like some crap Wonderbread--with avocado, eggs, smoked salmon, dill sauce, and onions and sprouts layered on it. The thing is, the eggs are the BEST EGGS EVER (and I&#39;m kind of an egg fanatic). It&#39;s basically an omelette with chives mixed into it but they make the eggs super soft and fluffy. Absolutely divine. And the potato wedges that come with the tartine are perfectly crisp and salty. We also got mimosas, which were just the cherry on top to a great brunch.The thing that&#39;s great about Noe Valley is that is has all these great eateries and semi-upscale boutiques, but it doesn&#39;t read overtly hipster like the mission or pretentious like the marina. I got the same vibe from Griddle Fresh. The decor (or lack thereof) was super simple and the staff was really friendly. Dishes are reasonably priced at $10-$15 an entree. Mimosas are $8 and my only problem with them is that there is no option to go bottemless. Parking around here isn&#39;t too terrible. There is metered parking on 24th, but there are a lot of side street with free street parking.I will definitely be back to try the rest of the menu. I&#39;m looking forward to 6-hour Corned Beef Hashes and Seaboard Benedicts and Tex Mex Scrambles. So glad to have found a great neighborhood restaurant with such delicious and creative dishes!

My friends and I do brunch every weekend and have been getting around the city a bit. Griddle Fresh is a nice little spot with a diner feel all over it. The interior is quite shabby and packed in. I wasn&#39;t a huge fan of the atmosphere.Service was fine, they simply seemed a bit hurried, which is understandable with all the tables they have packed in there. The food I have to say was quite good. I had the prosciutto Benedict. It was easily one of the better benedicts I&#39;ve had, it was creative and different. The hash-browns are also to die fore, they were flat and crispy, and not greasy at all - delicious!Overall, this place is definitely a place you should check out if you&#39;re a foodie, but not really a standout place to us as far as overall experience goes.

We waited for about 45 minutes, at this point I was thinking THIS PLACE BETTER BE WORTH IT. And it is! Their coffee was great, I had their Mexican style breakfast plate (I forgot the name), chorizo scrambled eggs with onions cheese and avocado. SO MUCH FLAVOR in every bite! I loved it! Not too spicy either! Since I can&#39;t really handle spicy food anymore this was perfect. My sour dough toast wasn&#39;t BURNT, which is really important to me because the last thing I need is the bread to ruin my amazing meal (you know how that is). My husband had one of their beers, he said it was really good as well. Next time I need to try their pancakes. Not the average fluffy looking pancakes, but almost like crepe style pancakes.

Souffle pancakes? Yes! The only complaint I have is that the bottom pancake was a little burned and did not fluff up like the other two. The two perfect pancakes were, well, heavenly. I got the ones with banana and walnuts. On my next visit (yes, I will be returning) I&#39;m going to try an omelet. Servings are more than ample, so I had leftover pancakes the next morning.

My girlfriend and I were excited to try the new neighborhood spot. The food was pretty good, but the price changed our opinions quickly. For pancakes and and a plate of eggs we spent $40 - how much do flour and eggs cost?! AND who charges for [watery] coffee refills?! That was a nice little surprise when the check came...We were a bit disappointed.

Even though there&#39;s an obsession with brunch in SF, rarely have I found a truly amazing brunch place. Griddle fresh has to be the best brunch I&#39;ve found in the city.The service is top notch. The food is amazing. The lemon ricotta souffle pancakes are phenomenal - you are basically eating a tasty delicious cloud. A friend and I split the rustic omelette and the pancakes last time we were here and it was the perfect mix of savory and sweet. Pretty much everything we&#39;ve tried here on the 3 or so times we&#39;ve been here has been great. And the prices are pretty reasonable too. It&#39;s a very Noe kind of place in that it&#39;s a crowd of kids and families mixed in with hipsters.

We put our name down and it took us 45 minutes to get seated. The hostess provided us the menu even before we were seated and asked what we would like. This was intended to save us time at the table. Overall our order took a while to come in.Food quality - it was tasty but nothing to blow my socks away. None of the items were especially unique or done differently versus a run of the mill diner.Overall, the place is a solid 3 stars.

I figured out why there is always a line outside this place and it&#39;s not because of the food. The service sucks and takes forever to get your food! Even better, after waiting 40 minutes for pancakes (not really difficult to make) my husband&#39;s meal was delivered 10 minutes after mine. Who thinks this kind of service is okay? Not me.

so to make this short and sweet. i saw the waitress DROP my leftover on the floor. heard her say sh*t loud as well. she picked it up and went came back out maybe 10 minutes later with my leftovers in a box. i open the box and noticed that my omelet was not cut(i only ate half) and was hot so i figured they just made me a new one. did not bother to call her out on it since they took the time to make me a new half omelet. so i get home and warm up the omelet the next day and slide over my avocado to notice that the omelet was indeed cut in half in the same manner that i cut it while eating that day.they dropped my omelet on the floor and warmed it back up and gave it back to me. i was speechless.i have no reason to lie about this so choose to believe it or not. i actually like griddle fresh and go monthly.

Super cool place for brunch in Noe valley. Their scrambled eggs are out of the world. A must try place for brunch if you are in the neighborhood. I will totally come back again.Note: I gave only 4/5 because the sandwich had way too much butter. Yes, I am a health freak ;)P.S: If you are a philz fan, they have a philz 4 blocks from here, you can get coffee there and then go for brunch. Their house coffee is decent too but nothing beats philz

utilitarian cultural identity crisis with a strange odor and polite-friendly waitstaff. The griddle fresh title might suggest more griddle-cake menu options but alas there are only two.. so go savory.. several unique dishes, Italian, tex-mex, asian, french.. diner coffee won&#39;t wow you, enjoy the limited window seating w no outside option. these details matter much less after you enjoy the food, which you will cause it&#39;s quite tasty!.., well presented, fairly portioned and somewhat locally sourced they tell me.. just get better coffee and you win all the stars!

I ordered the Benedict Parma - great choice! They also have really cute lattes in tall glass mugs. The breakfast menu is really creative, not the classic list you see at every brunch place you go. The service staff was speedy and polite. My friend ordered the tex mex scramble and said it was awesome - the put a lot of avocado on it. He also got the special hash which is their classic latka like hash brown (sooooo good and golden) covered in cheese and grilled veggies. Overall great experience but make sure you come at 9 on a weekday so you don&#39;t have to wait to be seated for an hour!

6 hours since the 1st and last time we&#39;ll eat at Griddle Fresh, and we&#39;re still taking turns in the bathroom. Had to cancel our Sunday afternoon plans. Would you like some prosciutto with your salt? Would you like some 6-hour hash with your salt? How about some fried potatoes with your fried potatoes? I&#39;m not kidding: One dish had 2 sides of potatoes. Would you like all the waitresses constantly bumping into you as they squeeze between overcrowded tables? And how about your bill half way through your breakfast? Then line up with the rest of the Smart-car-sized-stroller Noe Valley crowd at Griddle Fresh. I&#39;ll be at Le Zinc or just about any other place in walking distance of 24th &amp; Noe.

Small place.Good food.Okay service.Came here because of yelp ratings. I wanted to try the banana walnut souffle pancakes but I wanted something savory so I chose the Eggs Benedict. It was okay, I&#39;ve had better. It lacked some flavor, maybe salt? I don&#39;t know. and they gave a THICK cut of canadian bacon which was a bit overpowering. I know, more meat should taste better but no. The hash brown was a thin layer and it was crispy but SOAKED in oil. I would like it a LOT if there wasn&#39;t oil oozing out when I&#39;m cutting it in smaller pieces.Boyfriend had the Corned Beef Hash. YUM! Great flavor, it is a MUST TRY. But maybe a bit too much potato? the hash comes with big chunks of potato and it also comes with a side of wedge fries! But they were really good fries. Super crispy.Service was just whatever. They sat us, they gave us water, the took our order, and that was it. Didn&#39;t really say much.

After dropping my parents off at Amtrak in Oakland, I was on the hunt for a breakfast location with easy parking and good reviews. Someone had pancakes as I walked in so that was all I had on my mind, although they were definitely fancier than your average fare. I wavered between sweet and savory, and went with the lemon ricotta souffle pancakes. Jamie C. described my experience perfectly. The first few bites were great, but then the taste of eggs overwhelmed everything. I also had a side of bacon which looked like bacon I&#39;d never had before, so I had a strip or two and was done with those. The service was good, I&#39;m thinking there is something better on the menu for me than what I ordered.

Got here late in the day so apparently I missed the long lines of the brunch rush. I only waited about 20 minutes. Staff was very friendly and checked on us a few times. We ordered the banana souffle pancakes, the 6 hour corned beef hash and the italian omelette. The corned beef was delicious and tender and came with potato wedges, which were nice and crisp and seasoned well. Eggs were poached perfect with the perfect hollandaise sauce. Next time I would ask for a substitute of the wedges though, since there&#39;s already potatoes in the hash. The Italian was also good. The banana souffle pancakes, however, were heavenly. they were light and full of flavor. Perfect end to brunch. I&#39;m coming back to try the tartines

AMAZING! This place is so so so good. Although the wait is long (come on a weekday if you can) the food is so worth it. The banana mascarpone pancakes are out of this world and so different than any other pancakes I&#39;ve ever had. They are super rich and so unique. My dad got the 6 hour corned beef hash since he is not as much of a pancake fan, and also LOVED it. Both dishes were great! The interior is also very cute and charming :) Highly recommend Griddle Fresh!

I walked uphill from the other side of the Castro to satisfy my hankering for Midwestern breakfast with scrambled eggs, fresh ingredients and hash browns. This is what Griddle Fresh had to say: &#34;I&#39;ll see your Midwestern hashbrowns and I&#39;ll raise you some California eggs with ripe avocado, juicy tomatoes and San Francisco sourdough&#34;. It was well worth the hike.

Love this place! But it is small the there is always a crazy wait :( I get the GF hash browns and a side of apple sausage ummmm. However there is a man who works here I see every time I come in and he is not too friendly... Which makes the experience a little less enjoyable. There is street parking but it can be difficult to find since this is on 24th street. Weekends are especially busy, hard to find parking, and very long wait for a table. Get here early if you are thinking of coming on a Saturday or Sunday!

LOCATIONGreat neighborhood for brunch, meandering, and shopping. Street parking can be a little hard to find, but we were able to find some a couple blocks away.SERVICEWe put our names on the list, and only had to wait about 15-20 minutes. It was a Saturday morning around 11:30am, so that&#39;s so be expected anywhere in the city. Once we were seated, the staff was efficient about taking our order and bringing drinks. Our 2 dishes arrived separately, but since we were sharing, it was nbd. ;)FOODWe split the garden scramble and lemon ricotta souffle pancakes, and omg, the pancakes were amazing! They&#39;re definitely the most unique pancakes I&#39;ve ever had. For starters, I wasn&#39;t sure what to expect - souffle, pancake??? But they were soft and fluffy, and melted in your mouth. I also usually drench my pancakes in syrup but that was not necessary this time. The strawberry compote and butter were just enough. (The maple syrup that came with was also good, though - how could I not at least try it!) As for the garden scramble, a little saltier than I like, but it&#39;s likely due to all that parmesan goodness! The hashbrown was light and crispy, as anticipated, and even though the toast was hard and dry, it was a really great brunch overall. Freshly squeezed orange juice was also good, and coffee was always promptly refilled!I&#39;ll definitely be back to try their banana mascarpone souffle pancakes!!OTHER NOTESClean restaurant, even the bathroom, so check. Great neighborhood place - families, couples, friends all made this place quiet enough that you can have a conversation, but not so quiet that you have to worry about people overhearing your (sometimes embarrassing) conversations! Good service and solid brunch food with just the right amount of creativity. Overall, highly recommend!

If you are a fruit lover and go for a healthy meal, highly recommend substitute their fruit plate for extra $2 (again is huge portion!) anything they provide is generous!

I got the revered six-hour corned beef hash. It&#39;s pretty good, although it&#39;s a bit of potato overload: you have potatoes in the hash, obviously, and then a side of these potato wedges. Was hoping the grapefruit juice would be fresh, but no such luck.

This place is a fantastic little surprise of an eatery. I work down the block and tried it out right after they opened. I expected something decent but not great, but I&#39;m always a sucker for a place where I can get breakfast past 11am. But it turns out their food is fantastic! Well-made, great flavors, fresh ingredients and super friendly service. My go to dish is the BLT Eggs Benedict - poached eggs on a bed of steamed spinach, diced tomatoes, crispy, shredded bacon and, of course, English muffins. They top it with a delicious chive hollandaise and I always substitute the fruit - which is always a delicious assortment not just boring melon. It&#39;s a tasty, indulgent, but not unhealthy meal. Other great dishes include the Garden Scramble, the Chipotle Chicken Sando and a classic club sandwich. Don&#39;t be fooled by the nondescript interior, this place is a gem.

Like most decent places in SF, expect to wait to be seated.However, the food is AMAZING! I had the daily special salmon cake eggs benedict. All I can say is YUM MORE PLEASE! Also my friend had the strawberry souffle pancakes. It was not what I expected - it was BETTER in terms of how light and fluffy they were. For those with a cleaner palette, it may be a tad on the sweeter side but otherwise, great!If I lived closer to the City, I would definitely come here regularly :)

Pretty fantastic. Had the Salmon tartine, which is a medium-sized portion (more than I could eat) of pure deliciousness -- all top-quality and fresh ingredients. The avocado had no signs of brown spots and the salmon tasted like it had been smoked &#34;at home&#34; over coal. We went there during a cold day (around 45F), and so almost all customers kept their coats on. I&#39;m sure this place is less cold during warm days. Coffee was good, but not amazing. Fruit was flawless. The space is cozy and small but lively.

My experience was that the dishes were over-worked but not in a good way. Say for example you go to The Universal Cafe and have scrambled eggs. You know they will be absolutely perfect. Here at Griddle Fresh nothing is really perfect, and all of the dishes have WAY too much going on. There&#39;re trying too hard to create what they think is a gourmet experience and seem have forgotten how just to make a simple brunch.

These people are racist DO NOT eat here! On Friday January 23rd at 10:30 in the morning my girlfriend and I were discriminated against at this establishment. After waiting to be seated and given menus my girlfriend and I quickly made our selections and waited to be attended to. Several minutes later a group of 3 Caucasian people came into the restaurant and were promptly seated at the table next to us. Within three minutes of their arrival a waitress was at the table taking their order. I brought this to the attention of both the server and hostess and asked if they wanted to rectify the matter but they did not wish to apologize to me. My girlfriend and I were very offended and decided to leave. We can&#39;t support this type of racist behavior.

I was promptly and pleasantly greeted. They sat me at a table that i had two squeeze to get in to and I&#39;m a skinny guy. The neighbor about knocked mine over leaving hers (she wasn&#39;t so skinny). They sat people next to me and we were awkwardly close. I ordered the Italian omelette and I was not impressed. It was watery and there were a lot of mushrooms which normally would be favored, but they used oyster mushrooms and they weren&#39;t cooked proper to be soft so the whole thing was chewy and tough to eat. The portions of all the other fixings were scarce. The hash browns were so soaked in grease that I couldn&#39;t enjoy them and there was a distinct taste of steak in them from either being cooked too close or not cleaning the griddle from one item to the next. They served it with an orange garnish that was cut the wrong way and therefore difficult to eat and the bread was dry and crunchy. I ordered ice tea which cost 3.50. It came in a small glass full of ice and when I finished it, it sat empty the rest of my visit. I switched to the water they offered which came in an even smaller glass and quickly finished it. It was also never refilled. I&#39;m giving two stars instead of one because they were pleasant and the food service was quick, but I was not impressed, don&#39;t understand all the high ratings, and won&#39;t be back.

Okay, I&#39;ll give a shot.I&#39;m so glad I did! It was incredible, spicy and perfect. They have homemade jam on the tables which was also fantastic.

Food is great, wait can be short or annoyingly long, service spotty but getting better. I&#39;ve probably eaten here 15+ times and not sure why but they just started putting &#34;seasoning salt&#34;, aka MSG, on the potato wedges. I have a severe MSG sensitivity and was sick after just a few bites. Please stop using the seasoning salt or at least warn folks you are using it. Would be great if they started offering a gluten free toast option, even if there is an up charge. Otherwise, great resto, especially if you don&#39;t suffer from a million food restrictions...

One bite of the banana marscapone souffle pancakes and I forgot that I waited almost an hour and a half for it. I was initially worried that it would taste like dessert, but it was not sugary at all and surprisingly light. And did I mention delicious? So delicious. I would go back and wait another hour for it. My friend loved his 6 hour corned beef, but it was too much beef that early in the morning for me so I passed on it - the potatoes were delicious though.

Went there for Sunday brunch early at 9:30 and no wait. Right after we seated, there was a line, which leads to my dissatisfaction with the service as the waitress was beginning to push tables, especially ours.We had the lemon souffle pancakes and smoked salmon tartine. They were not flexible in substituting the chicken sausage link for a sausage patti....not sure why that was difficult since they offered both.The pancakes came nearly 15 minutes before the tartine, so I sat there and watched my guest eat without any coffee refills. The pancakes were a little burnt, but had a unique taste. I don&#39;t think the portion justifies $12 for 3 medium pancakes. When the salmon tartine came it was a large size and full of good stuff as other yelpers mentioned, including buttery avocado and a side of crispy fries.About halfway into my meal, the waitress abruptly comes over with the check! I was floored....literally just stood it up on our table almost blocking one another&#39;s view. They came by again two minutes later to take away a plate where my guest wasn&#39;t even finished, and just kept hawking the table as others were waiting.Honestly, the food was good for what&#39;s offered in Noe Valley, but the service was such a turnoff that if I were to return it would be takeout. To all of those critics of babies crying, that is literally half of the customers in Noe Valley, so if you do not cater to these customers, you do not have a casual restaurant business.

Tho is was not a huge fan of the dressing (I&#39;m picky) the salad was large, fresh and very tasty. The second time I had the egg sandwich. The homemade pork sausage was the best I have ever had, the aioli added a great &#34;zip&#34; and the egg was cooked perfectly. My companions meals were also very, very good. The service is a bit &#34;iffy&#34; because of some language barriers and new restaurant glitches but this place is worth a visit. No lines.....yet.

this place is so yummy! i got the frisco omelette, my friend got the 6hour corned beef hash, and we shared the french toast. the french toast was super sweet and good! it came with syrup, a kind of frosting, and granola and tasted more like dessert than breakfast. yum! the eggs on my omelette were nice and fluffy and perfectly encased the sausage, onions, and tomatoes. i love how thinly they cut the avocados -- it was just enough to eat one slice per bite of omelette. the hashed browns are the thinnest and crispiest ive ever had! i tried my friend&#39;s corned beef and it was nice and tender. we also got mimosas, and although they were yummy it could have used a larger portion of champagne. don&#39;t forget to try their jam!

Favorite plan- come with a (small) group of friends (it&#39;s itty bitty, so maybe just 2 of you or 4) order the salmon tartine, and share the souffle pancakes as a joint &#34;dessert&#34; with your friends. I&#39;ve had both of the pancake varieties, and prefer the Banana Mascarpone but that&#39;s just my taste- they&#39;re both phenomenal! It&#39;s a popular brunch place and they&#39;re a bit small so there is usually a bit of a wait. But, as I mentioned, totally worth it. Go shop at Ambiance while you wait :)

I highly recommend the banana mascaroone pancakes (I usually don&#39;t like pancakes, with this exception). Crab salad has a more than generous amount of fresh crab meat, fairly priced.

This is not your average brunch place. In fact I want to take issue with another review here which said that this place doesn&#39;t offer any unique items and is not much different than a run of the mill diner - that is absolutely incorrect, almost all of their menu items are unique takes on some classic brunch recipes. Such as homemade sausage on their egg sandwich, a pulled pork scramble, and some great takes on the classic benedict like the prosciutto and mozzarella benedict and another one with crab and sauteed shrimp. Everyone in our party enjoyed what they ordered and all of us agreed that their unique brunch fare would be worth coming back for to try some more of their great looking dishes. Some of the items we tried were the corned beef with poached eggs, the fried egg sandwich and the chorizo scramble with jalapeno relish and all were great. Even some of the little things were done well, like the high quality bread the offer for their toast and the generous portion of fresh avocado they use as garnish on some of their egg dishes. The only complaint that comes to mind for me was that my corned beef dish came over red potatoes and also a side of their house potatoes which come with most of their brunch dishes - if the dish already has potatoes in it they should serve it with a different side because no one needs two helpings of potatoes with their breakfast. Also the place is a little crowded and cramped but the quality of their food makes it more than worth it (just go early or you&#39;ll be waiting outside for awhile). I will definitely be going back again soon.

Getting breakfast at a restaurant is usually pretty standard fare. In this case, Griddle Fresh is a cut above the rest. I gauge these kinds of places on how well they can do something really simple. Scrambled eggs with cheese, hash browns, bacon and toast. Basic breakfast, right? Put simply, they nailed it. Easily the best scrambled eggs I&#39;ve ever had. Just like a make them at home, the cheese is scrambled INTO the eggs, not just laid on top. Perfectly crisped bacon, simple toast (with super fresh raspberry preserves at the table!), and nice crispy hash browns. Last week I went to Toast down the street and it was okay...but I&#39;ll be sticking with Griddle Fresh from now on.
