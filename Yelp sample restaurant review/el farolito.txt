&#34;I&#39;m hungry,&#34; said my friend. I peered over to the top corner of my phone screen, and it said 12:10 AM. So we did what any sensible San Franciscan would do: we Ubered to El Farolito.When they say the city truly comes alive at night, they&#39;re not joking. As soon as we walked in we exchanged nods with a security guard. The long line (which went all the way to the door) was filled with some peculiar characters: college students, the aspiring rapper, and a couple with a little bit too much PDA.Despite that, the line went by really fast. Every 30 seconds, a bell would ring, signifying the creation of a new burrito, or quesadilla, or tacos...or whatever the previous person ordered. Now let&#39;s talk about the nitty gritty.Ambience Rating (2.5/5):This place is super hole-in-the-wall. The booths, tables, and chairs feel quite old. I made a fatal mistake of wearing my pajamas. Let&#39;s just say I wouldn&#39;t recommend wearing the same clothes to bed after sitting in one of their booths. The busboy did however meticulously wipe the tables after each consequential meal. If you decide to eat at the restaurant, they bring the food to your table. A large TV in the corner of the dining room played live soccer (or football).Food Rating (5/5):Listen folks: there&#39;s a reason why this place is filled at midnight. The food is delicious. Make sure to get the &#34;super&#34; variant of whatever food you&#39;re getting. I think that it basically just adds meat and a few other things. While I was waiting for my food, I was given tortilla chips. In a corner was a salsa bar where you could grab from to your heart&#39;s content.I&#39;ll focus on what I got, which was the &#34;Super Quesadilla.&#34; When I took my first bite, I knew at that moment that the wait had been worth it. There was a crunchy and soft texture, and the cheese was literally melting in my mouth. The finely cut pieces of steak and occasional chunk of guacamole was glorious. At the end of my meal, I was filled and greatly satisfied.Did I mention that this was all for under $10?Summary:Just stop reading my review and go to El Farolito. Right now. They care about you, they care about their food, they&#39;re open late, they&#39;re super cheap, and the food is deliciously filling.

Love this place! Was craving a burrito, read some reviews and decided to give it a shot. Tried the el pastor super burrito and oh man, was it delicious and fairly large!Came in off-peak and it was still fairly crowded. There is ample seating inside for small to larger groups. The inside at this location is pretty beat down, but the food more than makes up for it. They have a salsa bar right next to the register. I will sample more items next time I eat here. I&#39;m a fan! :)

I ordered the super quesadilla and it was so good! It came in two pieces and I was only able to eat half. Very filling. I also love their pico de gallo that they offer with the chips. It was very spicy, just the way I like it. Their frescas are also good. I ordered the strawberry flavored one. I believe each day they have different flavors.

Late night eats after a night of drinking? That&#39;s how I messed up here. I ordered a super burrito with carne asada and lengua. It wasn&#39;t that great, and the meat tasted old.Maybe I&#39;m just spoiled from the Mexican food in OC and SD, but this spot did not hit the spot. Their chips and salsa were pretty good though.

This has been my go to spot for burritos since 2012 when my friend first brought me here. There is the more well known location located on 24th street and mission but I personally prefer this one because it&#39;s bigger and not as crowded. The only downside is that it&#39;s tad far for more as it is in the inner mission but whenever I need that burrito fix, I come here. Nothing is more worth it than getting a super burrito with chips and unlimited salsa for under $10. Seriously doesn&#39;t get better than that anywhere else as the prices in San Francisco is rising so for them to remain their low prices is truly amazing. I recommend their super burritos because it gets you super full for two people even if you think you eat a lot, trust me, you will get satisfied with only half of this deliciousness.

Got the super burrito with chicken. It was baby-sized, which is great as I was super hungry. I still couldn&#39;t finish it and I&#39;m a big eater. Their nachos and sauces was super yummy, one of them was a lot spicier than anticipated. The one negative is that I opened my burrito in the wrong end so it was kinda dry u til I got to the bottom where the sauces were hiding. Could have been marked with a marker maybe? Anyways that was my mistake. The taste was good but not great as it could probably have been if I started eating in the right end. And plus one start for calling me gringo :-) Yum!

I&#39;m born and raised in San Francisco. So if you want good Mexican food I would check out La Corneta, La Mission or Papalotes. My wife wanted to know why this place was rated so high and had over a thousand reviews...so I decided to take her here for lunch. This place sucks! The chips are always salty, $3.10 for a carne asada taco with no taste?! You&#39;ve got to be kidding me. Ok, great they give you free chips and salsa and it&#39;s open until 2-3am...if you plan to come here after the club expect long lines. Other then that poor taste in Mexican food.Quality over Quantity!!

Let me just start this review by saying I&#39;m personally not the biggest fan of Mexican food but this place blew my socks off! Definitely a hole in the wall Mexican restaurant.I got a super burrito and I swear it was the best burrito I have ever had. The rice was soft and the meat was juicy. Everything worked really well together and nothing was so overpowering. And I also liked how they wrapped the burrito in foil so nothing would fall apart and it made it easy to cut in half.In addition to the amazing food they also give you complimentary chips and salsa bar. The red salsa is actually really spicy gives everything a nice kick.Only complaint is that the tables were a little small but over all 10/10 would come back!

El Farolito is one of those must tries while in San Francisco, but I was really not blown away.Coming from SoCal maybe I am just used to a different style Mexican food, but it did not blow me away.Cash only and really busy, plan to wait a bit, though the lines moves quickly.Service was nice and while the quesadilla was pretty good and the only thing worth getting again, the burritos fell flat.We all went with the al pastor which was ok, but again I have had better.Prices and portions are fair, this makes for great drunk or hangover food, but for a normal lunch or dinner I would not bother to return.

This is the spot. Food is so on point!My favorite meats to choose are carne asade and al pastor. I always get tacos with extra cilantro. There tacos are served on two corn tortillas, your meat of choice, cilantro, onion and hot sauce. They have other selections of tacos but the original is the best. It&#39;s definitely a must try because it&#39;s simple but flavorful.I always come here and it never disappoints. Strawberry agua fresca is great to wash everything down.

I think I found my go-to burrito place in the city.This is probably the top 3 burritos I had in my life.Everything about the meal hit all the right notes.The complimentary chips were crispy and not too oily.The salsa (especially the green one!) had the depth of flavor that is only found in the rarest of Mexican restaurants.The burrito was made well.All the components of the said burrito were seasoned and prepared to near perfection.Super happy to have discovered this place.

This was always my go-to for late night Mexican. They&#39;re open until 3am.The line can get pretty long at night, but they make your food pretty quickly. I usually order a carne asada quesadilla suisa. The tortilla is toasted to perfection with a generous amount of meat! Huge portions with plenty to take home for next-day leftovers. My friends always opt for burritos and enchiladas- I&#39;m not really a big fan of either.The employees are kinda creepy but who cares? They make a mean quesadilla (or burrito or enchiladas or tacos, for that matter). They&#39;ll give you free chips too with a variety of different salsas.Actually, any time of the day is perfect for El Farolito&#39;s!Street parking is only available, but it&#39;s not too bad. The interior is a bit rundown, but it&#39;s San Francisco. The best restaurants are the rundown or the hole-in-the-walls.

I haven&#39;t been to this place in yeeeeears! I was in the area so I had to stop by. I ordered the big shrimp burrito! Mmmmm. The burrito contained a generous amount of shrimp which was a plus. The burrito overall was super flavorful and delicious! I also ordered a chile verde taco which was on point as well. The pork fell apart as soon as it hit my mouth. My food from here was so good I forgot to take a picture of my meal which is kind of odd behavior for a foodie like myself.

Came here as a last stop before leaving San Fran. This place is a truly authentic Mexican place-having such classics such as the Lengua (beef tongue) and Cabeza (beef cheek) taco. Both cuts of meat were tender as could be and paired wonderfully with the authentic salsa verde and cilantro. None of that Americanized corn and other fillings to be found, just pure meat and sauce. If you don&#39;t care much for ambiance but enjoy good food, come here!

I&#39;ve been coming to this el farolito ever since I was a 8 years old. And I can easily say this is one of my favorite taquerias.Everything on the menu is good. My only concern is that the prices for a super taco, which is about 4.50 is a little steep. Because two super tacos won&#39;t fill me up, but a super burrito can for about less than two super tacos. Also the super chicken quesadillas are really good here!

Pair that with multiple scoops of their house made green salsa and you&#39;re in for a treat.

How have I not written a review for this place sooner?This is the only place that can satisfy my burrito phases/cravings. I can&#39;t describe what it is about this place, even though they give me whole beans instead of refried beans whenever I ask, the burrito is still THAT DAMN GOOD. Orders are made fairly fast, if not there are plenty of spots to sit and wait. Parking can be a hassle, depending on what time you go there.My usual is the super shrimp and lengua burrito with everythaaang. Surf &amp; Turf is the way to go! I feel extremely lucky that this place serves lengua too because it&#39;s not always a common thing on menus and lengua is relatively more expensive than other meats. Although the hot sauce they put in the burrito is almost non-existent, you can always take a few steps to your left and fill up the to go canisters with their infamous green sauce that packs a good punch. Bag of chips do come with your burrito order and I believe they are made in house.I have ordered their tacos before but have had better elsewhere. Quesadillas are pretty packed full of cheese and the works depending on what you order.The frescas are pretty good as well. Their strawberry one seems to be most popular, although packed full of sugar.I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever like burritos anywhere else... El Farolito, you have stolen my gut and soul. I am faithfully.. forever yours.On a side note to the employees... please try to stop overcooking my shrimp though... just sayin.P.S. - To the progressive house heads in the EDM scene, this spot is Kaskade approved. :)

Can&#39;t believe there is a location within a mile of my house -game changer. Forget postmates, this changes how one satisfies after midnight cravings. The people are great, they are smaller so don&#39;t move the line as fast as the location on 24th and mission but it feels more local and homely here with enough tables for families to to sit down and have dinner. Anyways, my favorite burrito and $5 ceviche in town.Ask for a foil bag and bring home lots of the sauce - I could seriously drink that sauce it&#39;s so good.

It has been many years since i&#39;ve been to this place. I usually go to the one across the street but since my brother decided to go back to this place, i decided to give this place a try againHad the regular burrito. Only difference that the regular have from the super burrito are the sour cream and guacamole which the regular don&#39;t come with. Usually i don&#39;t put the beans in my burrito but i decided to this time. Has a a little spicy taste from the salsa. The beans kinda made the burrito a little dry. Put the guacamole that i got from sauce bar for each bite give it the extra flavor and moist. Usually, i can only eat half of a burrito but for some reason, i was able to eat all of the burrito. Its either i was really hungry or they make their burrito really small.The price is alright. $7+ for the regular burrito. I would say that its a little more expensive here when comparing to the one across the street(its a little cheaper from the mexican restaurant across the street)They make their food quick.

Let me start by saying that I&#39;m not sure if I went on an off night or something was just not right tonight , this place was definitely not what I expected especially after reading the other reviews.

If I had to choose one place to eat for the rest of my life, it would be here!This is my go to place any time I need to feed the beast that is my belly. When I come in, I feel like I&#39;m part of the family. Always greeted, the guy that usually stands at the register remembers me and my boyfriend. He let&#39;s me practice my Espanol and restrains himself from bursting out laughing.The food is always fresh, they cook it right in front of you. Since you can clearly see the food area, you never have to worry about spit in your food or having your food be picked off the floor. You may think I exaggerate, but let&#39;s face it, if we learned anything from the movie &#34;Waiting&#34; or &#34;Still Waiting...&#34; We never know what is happening behind the closed doors of a restaurant. Some guy could have touched his sweaty balls and then continued to cook your food without the washing of hands. Or perhaps, you did something truly awful or perhaps your are just a crappy human being, dandruff and lugies could get on your food. Though, let&#39;s face it, you probably deserve it. But still, you get the point (I hope), transparency is great!Honestly though, the best food in town is right here! Fill that hunger hole with a side of Coca- Cola de Mexico and you&#39;ll be in greasy heaven for the rest of your day!

This place is not very good at all. Everyone always wants to come here so I&#39;ve been to El Farolito on at least 3 separate occasions, and every time I honestly would have rather gone to taco bell.Their carne asada is really bland, and their guac isnt very good either. Their salsas I can get the same quality anywhere.I had the al pastor burrito one time. It tasted like there was ketchup in my burrito.I honestly have no idea what people like about this place.

El Farolito is the closest taqueria near my house, however, I would much rather drive further into the Mission to get my taco or burrito fix. Parking on Friday or Saturday nights can be pretty bad, so be prepared to either circle multiple times or walk from Safeway. Normally, I would get the carne asada, but I&#39;ve had the carnitas as well and an occasional bite of their grilled shrimp. The employees at El Farolito are usually pretty nice and I haven&#39;t had any complaints regarding their service, which is great! The burritos and tacos can be on the bland side at times, but hey, drunchies. A-OK for me!

This spot&#39;s carne asada burrito isn&#39;t as tasty as the original farolito BUT there was no line when I went!! It was lunch time on a Friday so I&#39;d choose not having to wait a long time for my food any day! The place itself is a little outdated- there are super old sticker vending machines and two basic pinball machines (you can win up to three bouncy balls all for the whopping price of 50 cents!). Anyway.. Must try the carne asada super burrito aaaand the carne asada nachos (pretty big serving size for nachos!) if you do get the nachos, eat it fast bc the chips get soggy.

AHH. I almost cried tears of joy while eating El Farolito last night!!SO good. My bf &amp; I ordered a super shrimp quesadilla (diff between the regular and super is the avocado and sour cream-DO IT) and also the super carne asada burrito. Both were sooo great. I&#39;ve only had El Farolito one time before this and it was still good. But last night hit the spot!! Can be a little pricey though... $11+ for just the quesadilla, but I would say it&#39;s worth it! Every time I took a bite, I was going through an emotional roller coaster. It&#39;s so good, but now my food is disappearing. But once I finished my meal I was definitely satisified and it was definitely a great portion size. The quesadilla comes with two btw. The first time I ordered it, I ended up cutting into both at the same time and wondering why it was so thick. Don&#39;t be a newb like me!They have lots of street parking and we went on a Saturday night around 12A..So happy it was open late--GREAT for drunchkies!! PLEASE GO. you won&#39;t regret it.P.S. Why are there no pictures for this review??? I was so excited to eat, I didn&#39;t snap a photo in time... And once I hit that first bite there was no turning back...WHOOPS!

Was back home in SF for the Niner game last weekend and one of the thing&#39;s I promised my friends that were flying in from LA is that I&#39;d take them to get their first mission burrito... and for me, that means El Farolito. They are the standard... I picked them up from the airport and asked them what they wanted to do and it was to get some burritos. HA! Yess..Headed to the Mission. Found parking fairly quickly on Mission St. not too far from El Farolito. I went with a regular carnitas burrito opting for no cilantro. It was delicious... Just as I remember. Full of flavor and perfectly rolled, double wrapped in foil to consume in the restaurant or on the run. The rice was tasty and the carnitas was smoky pork perfection. I loved it... It was good to be back in the Mission enjoying some El Farolito. My other friend got a chorizo burrito and the other got a carne asada suiza quesadilla. They both were very satisfied with what they ordered.As customary, you get some tortilla chips for your table. Self serve on the salsa. Green or red, depending on what your preference is. Service was friendly and fast. We got there around 1230pm. It wasn&#39;t too packed at the time but as soon as we sat down to eat, the line started growing... Looking forward to going back to El Farolito next time I&#39;m in the city. It&#39;s a must stop every trip now. Next time: carne asada super burrito... no cilantro, of course.

Saw a website that said this place was the #1 burrito place in the U.S. &amp; in my area ? So I definitely had to try it and see it if really lived up to it&#39;s name.Definitely lots of customers but they&#39;re pretty quick with their orders. Plus, every order comes with free chips! Yaaasss!I ordered the quesadilla suiza and the super burrito I believe, both with carne asada. Both came very quickly after ordering; approximately 2-5 minutes later.. Both very jealous. I definitely recommend trying the carne asada meat with the burrito. So goooood.Each was about $6-$7 and they&#39;re pretty big! So definitely worth your money

I grew up in this neighborhood.This location is way less packed than the one around 24th and Mission and the quality is just as legit, too, which is GREAT because I fucking hate waiting in a 30-foot long line with a herd of transplanted douchebag hipster tech-bros.&#34;Anyways&#34;The crowd (at 2am, obviously) is definitely more local with demographics from the Excelsior neighborhood and Outer Mission/Daly City.An Al Pastor Super Burrito is where it&#39;s at. Black beans, with chips, and all the salsa you can consume. Pepper thy angus, because the savory deliciousness will overwhelm even the most hearty of men.If you decide to eat at the restaurant, leave a goddamn tip for the busboy because you&#39;re about to drop a surprisingly unreasonable mess considering the fact that you only ate a burrito and some chips.5 Stars.

One of my go to spots if you want some bomb ass Mexican food. Been coming here for years and has never disappointed me. There&#39;s also another location on Grand ave in South San Francisco. I usually get the super burrito which is pretty dam fat and pretty cheap. And there chips are cracking! Haha The only draw back is parking. Since its on mission street which is a busy street parking can be tough.

This place is waaaaaaay over hyped in my opinion.. I rather go to the Mexican place across the street to grab my burrito fix. But I had to try it for myselfOrdered a beef burrito and my friend ordered a super burrito. Difference between a normal and the super is super comes with guac and sour cream... My burrito was extremely dry and Beef was chunks of fat and little meat. My friends burrito was definitely better than mine IMO. No guac and sour cream in your burrito is no Bueno.. Would rather you pay extra for the super..You order then you grab your receipt, find a table or wait for your food, then gotta go check back for your order. Gets packed easily. Gotta wait a bit but not too long for your food. There is free water which is awesome!!!

When I go back home to sf this is one of my first stops. Grew up in the excelsior (not all these new fancy neighborhood renames) and thankful this place is still here and although there is the inevitable gentrification, good to see familiar faces. Plus they are open late.

The best burritos I have had in San Francisco were from El Farolito. The restaurant does not get 5 stars though because I believe it could be kept in better sanitary conditions. That being said El Farolito remains among the finest options to grab Mex food in the city.

I have been there a few times with a friend who lives in SF. I do live in LA, so our thing out here is Mexican food. I know when it is good food or not really. I have been here twice and it is awesome I have to tell you. I had a Torta de Carne Asada as recovery food for the SF Marathon the last time I had some. My friend always goes here for Mexican food and she always says how awesome it is. I always want to tell people if they want to get away from the city core up in the Mission and Downtown and explore another neighborhood, to just come to the Excelsior and to come and eat there. I have to say that it is great.

Best taqueria in SF hands down. People talk about guads across the street but this is the real deal.Food is outstanding; my personal favorite is the al pastor. The steak is really good and flavorful and even the grilled chicken is pretty good. Tacos are on point, tortas are always really good, burritos are fat and packed with flavor, but of course the all time best is the quesadillas. Nobody can beat them in the quesadilla game. Don&#39;t be mistaken guys come here not guads.

I remember the first time i tried this place..1998, fresh fom germany..i never had a burrito and i never heard of resturaunts being open past 10..it was about 130am and my cousin came through with a beautifully wrapped huge burrito..18 yrs later i can still taste my first bite. since it was my first, my bar was set from el faralito and no spot in the bay down to sac has satisfied my burrito needs..so even living in vallejo for a moment, and now currently in vacaville...i still have to travel all the way to sf just to get my burrito fix...highly recommended!

This will be a quick review and to the point. Ordered the Super Shrimp Burrito which is now a whopping 11.25 plus tax. Keep in mind this is at least 2.00 more than any other taqueria in San Francisco so I would think they would be smart enough to get my order right... they&#39;re not.The workers here are pretty stupid and not attentive to your order so I suggest next time you watch how they make your food so they don&#39;t screw it up. So back to my order which isn&#39;t too hard to understand if you pay attention, which they don&#39;t do very well, unless you&#39;re brain-dead. Ordered the above item and specifically asked for refried beans and avocado instead of their whole beans and guacamole. Gave me guacamole instead and it was a pitiful serving of around a teaspoon.There are better places that pay more attention to your order like Los Coyotes and even Pancho Villa. El Farolito has gone downhill since they were the go to taqueria in San Francisco. High prices, lower quality, miniscule servings, inept workers is more than enough to try other places.

My usual go-to taqueria is Reina&#39;s, which is a few blocks south of El Farolito. However, I&#39;ve heard about how good El Farolito is, so I thought I&#39;d give them a try and see what all the hype is about.I tried their super tacos, one with grilled chicken and one with grilled beef. Super tacos come with cheese, sour cream, fresh avocado, onion, cilantro, and hot salsa on two warm flour tortillas. There was plenty of flavor in each bite, the hot sauce has some heat, and the fresh avocado slices are rich and buttery. The grilled chicken was really good, but I thought the beef was very dry and chewy, like jerky. Two super tacos is roughly the same price as one super burrito, and although I haven&#39;t tried their burritos yet, I&#39;m pretty sure the satisfaction and the portion for price is more worth it for the burrito.I also tried their super quesadilla with grilled chicken, which unfortunately, wasn&#39;t as enjoyable. The chicken was good, but the quesadilla itself was thin and small, though very cheesy. It came with avocado, but there wasn&#39;t a lot. I much prefer the super quesadilla from Taqueria Reinas.

I heard that this place serve the best mexican food in Northern CA! So I wanted to see what the hype is all about! Came here for the first time with my friends for lunch the other day, it was pretty good! But not the best best, that I&#39;d rank it as the best.As my base burrito, I got the carne asada super burrito. It was huge!! You can save some for dinner or even split a burrito with a friend. I can imagine if you do come in after clubbing or a night of drinking, this might be the besssttt place to go and the food is going to be amazing!I&#39;d come here after a night of drinking or after clubbing if I&#39;m in SF!

So I personally think the Mexican place across the street has the best burrito in SF, but for some strange reason they needed to close for 30 minutes @ 7pm Sunday night. My husband and I were bummed (actually I was devastated), and I was not looking forward to going anywhere else, but we were craving a burrito so we decided to come here. We got really lucky and there wasn&#39;t a long line (yet), but the guy taking orders was kinda rude and just stared at me waiting for me to speak. No greeting, no nothing. Anyway, I reluctantly ordered two super burritos, one with grilled chicken and the other with carne asada, and filled about five or six containers with their watery salsa. At this point I was soooooo sad that I wasn&#39;t getting my favorite burrito and did not think this one was going to even come close.When we got home I quickly opened my burrito and started eating, and to my surprise it was good. I&#39;ve had burritos from here before, but it&#39;s been a really long time, so I guess I had forgotten they weren&#39;t bad. I still think the place across the street does a better job and has a better salsa verde, but my carne asada was well cooked and there wasn&#39;t too much guacamole (I prefer avocado as opposed to guac, which may sound silly so some, but I just think it tastes better and isn&#39;t all mushy). I felt it would annoy the already irritated-looking cashier if I asked for avocado, so I said nothing and prayed I wouldn&#39;t regret it later.Anyway, this is a solid burrito joint and I won&#39;t dread coming here if I have to. They just need work in their salsas and customer service.

3.5The employees are pretty rude, but they make a pretty good super quesadilla. I got the super shrimp quesadilla &amp; it couldn&#39;t get much better ... Unless they lowered the price. $11.25 is a bit over priced for a taqueria I feel. I really enjoyed their salsa.The place itself was a bit messy. A lot of tables had trash on them from the preview guests. The area it&#39;s in isn&#39;t the greatest.Probably won&#39;t be coming back here unless they lower their prices a bit.

This place was a great spot for my friend and me to sit down and have dinner near the 24th St Mission BART. If we&#39;d been so inclined, it would have been just as doable to take away the food. As a vegetarian, I had the typical options that a Mexican food restaurant offers. My regular veggie burrito was good, but not notably tasty without the salsa. HOWEVER, guacamole came with the regular vegetarian burrito, and you had to upgrade to the super vegetarian burrito for cheese and sour cream. As someone who&#39;s low-dairy and high-as-possible guacamole, this was a pleasant surprise.My friend ordered a chicken quesadilla and it was massive. I never leave food on the table at a restaurant, and if I still ate meat, I might have left a couple bites of this quesadilla. When I lost my food ticket, the server very logically and very graciously convinced me that the food he had was my own, and he was entirely correct. I would eat here again if I were in the area, and--since it&#39;s near the BART station--I probably will be; however, I probably wouldn&#39;t seek it out.

The rough part about not living near San Francisco anymore is being far away from this place. The burritos at this particular El Farolito have been specifically engineered for my taste buds. I don&#39;t know what they do with their grilled chicken, but as long as that doesn&#39;t change I&#39;ll make an effort to be their customer when I&#39;m in the area.I generally get burritos, but my El Farolito saga started with the quesadilla suiza. Grilled chicken and cheese in a fat tortilla - this is a relatively simple combination of food items, no? Yet somehow it tasted like magic. When I transitioned to burritos, I started with the regular burrito. Grilled chicken was now paired with rice, pinto beans, cilantro, onions, and salsa. This combination is more complex and be a little more dynamic as I get mine without onions. The same result: magic. I&#39;ve since been relatively incapable of moving past the regular burrito due to less than enthusiastic appreciation of sour cream and general lack of a large enough appetite to consume a super burrito, but it&#39;s there [and good] if you want it. The regular burrito is a little dry without the super fixins, yes, but their magical salsa verde makes up for it. This is the first place I tried horchata, and while it&#39;s not even as good as the place across the street, it&#39;s worth getting.That more or less sums up the El Farolito experience for me. I&#39;ve tried other meats (asada and lengua in particular) and other dishes (chile verde mainly), but it all comes back to that regular burrito with grilled chicken, or the quesadilla suiza with grilled chicken if I&#39;m feeling nostalgic. I&#39;ve taken almost every friend I&#39;ve ever had here and most of them love the place like I do. We occasionally have to think up some thin excuses to make the trip up here, the thinnest of which was, &#34;Want to get El Farolito?&#34;The burritos are capable of standing on their own without any input from their human consumer. I don&#39;t want to undersell that particular aspect of the El Farolito experience. If there isn&#39;t any sorcery going on behind the scenes, I&#39;ll eat my shoe - after eating this here burrito.The price has gone up over the years, but I don&#39;t let that be a deterrent. If I&#39;m going to go to a place whose chefs are wizards, I&#39;m not going to be cheap. (Don&#39;t read that as an endorsement to charge more.)I have a routine where if I go during the week or on a Saturday, I park in the neighborhood above the restaurant. If I go on a Sunday, I park on the street. That part about me not being cheap doesn&#39;t extend to parking costs. If I can avoid paying even a nickel for parking, it&#39;s generally worth the effort. Yet going to another taqueria when the heart yearns for that magical Farolito goodness... the disappointment sticks for days. Weeks even. I can&#39;t betray my one true love, and when push comes to shove, I&#39;ll throw the quarters at the meter maid because this little taqueria&#39;s worth it.A note: the more popular location further up Mission is also good. The South San Francisco location is lesser tier, but good. I avoid the San Jose location despite living down the street from it.

What can I say? At a time when the most significant social improvement to me was the invention of the &#34;mickey&#39;s big mouth bottle&#34; this place really became part of my life. Growing up in the city this was one of many established go-to&#39;s.First thing&#39;s first, these guys are open into the early morning. Everything comes hot and fresh and it&#39;s always sketchy because it&#39;s supposed to be. I mean it&#39;s still in the excelsior and you should know what you are getting into when you go on a 2am burrito run. You will see folks you want to see and you will run into folks you hate to see. But again that&#39;s just part of it.Come here for the burritos or the suiza and you are solid. Don&#39;t forget your chips and salsa and don&#39;t sweat that all the cooks look like the guys from that one bathroom scene in Training Day. That&#39;s part of the draw. Point I&#39;m making is you can&#39;t tell me you grew up in the sco&#39; and not know of el Farolito.

My old neighborhood I grew up in. I wanted to try this one since I&#39;ve been to the Grand Ave one near the Airport/Candlestick Park and this place was not the same.No Chile Relleno. Hecka Salty. Strawberry Fresco Drink didn&#39;t taste as fresh and was sweeter.Ordered the Super Quesadilla Chicken and Tortilla was hard on the bottom. Super Shrimp added Carne Asada Burrito was super salty along with chips. Shrimp seemed smaller also. Salsa bar was near garbage.Just a let down since I rave about the one on Grand Ave that I bring my friends to. Now I&#39;m trying to sleep with a dry mouth.

Knowing that it was cash only and having a fair grasp of the line before visiting, I was completely comfortable and at ease in line with my money.I have had pretty much everything on the menu, but keep going back for the super burrito and the Al Pastor tacos. Employees are quick and efficient, serving dozens of people every hour. Seating is a little cramped, but eating outside has never really bothered me. I just keep finding myself going back time and again.

As a Mexican who can make killer food of all kinds..I can make better rice, beans, salsa, enchiladas, and various of the food items that they serve better at home.I came here one late night with my boyfriend and decided to eat here because it&#39;s next to my house. After receiving our orders, I asked myself,&#34;what the fuck was I consuming?&#34;The flavors are very bland. The rice sucked and my enchiladas were microwaved and the sauce tasted like it was out of a can. What a waste of money.If I would have known--I could have easily just thrown a tortilla with cheese in the microwave at home and dipped it in a can of tomato paste and called it a night.I&#39;ve been to the one on 24th and mission and BOY IS THERE A DIFFERENCE.I&#39;d rather go to Taqueria Guadalajara across the street from this joint.I AVOID it by all means.

Cashier was rude and argumentative. Ordered a burrito without onions, but got one with onions. We sent it back but the cashier dug in the garbage to dig the check up without washing his hands after, then continued to insist we changed the order and he knew better. He also insisted we ordered whole beans which we never did, apparently he fished the wrong order out of the garbage.When u place an order you get a basket of tortilla chips with it. The basket came with about 10 chips in it for 4 people. When we asked for more we were told, &#34;you only get one basket because you only ordered one taco and one burrito each&#34; we tried to tell him there were hardly any chips in the basket but the cashier refused and really never understood what was being asked. This place has zero customer service, they obviously have a long way to go with dealing with people and customers if they want to keep this business going. Too bad as the tacos are pretty good however the workers apparently don&#39;t care about repeat customers. Go across the street, and you won&#39;t have to deal with the horrible customer service. Get a clue El Favalito.

Good taqueria food, but disappointed that they can&#39;t keep the place clean enough for patrons who actually dine in. The floor was disgusting and many table tops were covered in trash from previous customers. It was mid-afternoon on a Sunday, but didn&#39;t look super busy. Five guys behind the counter and not one could clean up the mess.Just pick up &amp; take out. It looks like a health hazard in there.

DISAPPOINTED.They forgot to put guacamole in my burrito. Okay, I understand they can get pretty busy, so I went back to wait in line and kindly asked them if they can give me a side of it. The cashier didn&#39;t say much and gave me a small side.After I finished half of my burrito, the cheese was no where to be found. I really don&#39;t mean to be picky, but this is a VEGETARIAN burrito and I was really looking forward to the guac and cheese. It&#39;s like having a meat burrito without the meat. Plus, shouldn&#39;t we get what we actually paid for?So I asked them kindly again if they can put some cheese on top. The cashier was pretty unapologetic about it, claiming that there should have been cheese inside. I showed him my half eaten burrito that there weren&#39;t any..and he just shrugged. Really?I honestly don&#39;t expect spectacular service from a taqueria, but when you make a mistake, own up to it and make your loyal customers happy!Good bye El Farolito, it&#39;s been nice knowing you for the past 8 years.

I like this one better then other locations. They hook up the food. The sour cream and guac is through out the entire burrito giving you a good moist burrito with out dry spots. I prefer carne asada.

The first thing I&#39;ll say about El Farolito is that me and my friends call it &#34;The Joint&#34;. Its always available, its always delicious, and its always exactly what you need.My specific order, a...&#34;Let me get a super steak burrito with no onions, cilantro or salsa, and a large strawberry&#34; never ceases to satisfy. The cashier is always a cool dude who gets what you want as long as you can say it loudly enough to overcome whatever sound is like at the time (I&#39;ve been going there since...forever, so he rarely even needs to hear me say it).I think overall, the food is delicious (I&#39;ve had tacos, quesadillas, shrimp burritos, steak burritos, and super nachos), but the one downside is that people approach it hearing people like me talk about it and come with these ridiculous expectations. Maybe even some of us propagate the expectations, kind of like Californian&#39;s and In N Out. But El Farolito won&#39;t falter at giving you a bomb ass burrito for about seven bucks, and thats the truth.

For as long as I shall live... Team El Farlito ftw. I grew up eating this. As I child I had this once a week - pretty unhealthy but my family loved it. As a child my parents would drop me off to pick up the order they placed usually a super burrito and a super nacho. Two orders filled our family. Now a days... We need two orders of quesadilla and a strawberry drink. They cashier risky recognizes me saying how I used to be shorter than the counter and now bam.. Taller then the glass display. The food here has always been great. It definitely tested better when I was younger and not caring about what I eat. It is definitely on the heavy side but heyyyyyyyy it&#39;s totally worth it.

Best drunk food ever!I&#39;ve never had food from El Farolito sober before, but it&#39;s probably just as good! It&#39;s super cheap and portions are humongous. I always order the super quesadilla, which could easily feed 2 sober people, but we all know being hungry while drunk is a whole different story so you should probably get your own if that&#39;s the case. I haven&#39;t tried anything else because their quesadillas are so good, but I know people who like the burritos and nachos too. I&#39;m sure you probably can&#39;t go wrong with anything on the menu though. The only thing I don&#39;t like about it is the location, but I think this one is less sketchy and definitely less crowded compared to the one in the Mission since it&#39;s farther from all the bars. I actually didn&#39;t know this El Farolito existed until my friend drove over here after we saw the line out the door at the other one. It was nice that the line was super short here and there were plenty of available tables.

Great place to grab a late night burrito or quesadilla. This El Farolito is less crowded than the other ones and much more open in terms of seating. Parking is available via street meter or, if you&#39;re lucky, neighborhood free parking.If you&#39;ve been to an El Farolitos before, it&#39;s more or less the same. Huge burritos at a great price. The carne asada is a favorite of mine and they do not skimp on the beef (or anything for that matter). Make sure to maneuver your bite so you can get every bit if goodness in your face hole.Service is nice and prompt. With a menu this simple, they&#39;ve probably heard all kinds of substitutes, but they catch every word of it.Highly recommend checking this place out.

Best taqueria in the city. Hands down. Food is also well-seasoned and its always best to ask for your meat well-done (the char on it is second-to-none). Much like it&#39;s brother shop in SSF it&#39;s amazing.Oh and for those people reviewing the customer service saying its bad...I&#39;ve never had any issues and they are definitely accommodating when it comes to any food requests you have.Also, the lady complaining on here about chips has to be making this up. I order takeout for my coworkers and have eaten there many times. Each person who orders something in your group gets a bag or basket of chips. Why would you get chips if you didn&#39;t order anything? That&#39;s a backwards way of thinking. Want free Chios and salsa without obligation? Head to your local, crappy Chevy&#39;s and enjoy your second rate food.

Today is National Taco Day. So I decided to review this taqueria popular for the late night crowd. The decor is outdated and unremarkable, but there&#39;s plenty of tables and the food is good. Really great tacos ($2.25) and tostadas ($3.25). They have menudo on weekends. The most popular items are the huge burritos ($5.50+, lots of sour cream) and the quesadillas. On this recent visit I bought lengua and carnitas tacos and a strawberry aguas fresca ($1.63). Not many SF places have both tasty food and are open late.After placing your order and receiving a basket of complimentary tortilla chips, don&#39;t forget to stop at the salsa bar to the left of the register. There&#39;s only a few choices: picante (red sauce), tomatillo sauce (green sauce, not spicy), pico de gallo (less watery than competitors) and rabanos (radish).Hours:Sun-Wed until 1:45amThu until 2:45amFri-Sat until 3:45am

ordered a super el pastor burrito today- didn&#39;t come with avocado and was a little sad not going to lie. anyways, the el pastor meat was very good and made the burrito juicy ! all of the other ingredients were pretty unnoticeable though. Pretty good burrito but wouldn&#39;t go back. also the salsa/hot sauce is definitely more like a fresh salsa- not my style.

love the strawberry agua fresca. but service could be improved. also, carne asada here is never as good as pollo - just not as fresh. torta is solid. tostadas are more like an open hard taco, literally some taco innards on a 5 inch tortilla chip. will keep coming though because it&#39;s nextdoor to the laundromat, until i finally try the other taqueria across the street.

I can eat anywhere, but my heart and stomach always wants this place. I only go to the one on 24th Street/Alabama and Mission Street/Onondaga. I haven&#39;t tried the one in SSF, but not for any reason. Their staff is nice, fast, and never get my orders wrong. My favorite thing to get is always the al pastor super suiza. When I decide to go big, I love getting either the carne asada burrito or my fav, the &#34;Bosses Burrito&#34; (I think only on 24th). This one comes with all the works and al pastor with camarones. It&#39;s BIG and filling - YUM! Their salsa verde is so perfect and much better on my food or just with chips. Speaking of chips, they charge $.65 at Mission location but it&#39;s not a biggie. I have some other places, well, plenty that I could go to but while El Farolito is open, i&#39;ll be true to them when I need my Mexican fix!

Right across the street from Taqueria Guadalajara. They have got a slightly different style but taste nearly the same. The prices are the same which sort of surprised me. It would be fun if they were a bit competitive with each other but they are both incredibly similar. The colours and atmosphere in this place is far more casual and different. I always order takeaways and for the most part their Super Burritos are quite good, so are the Super Quesadillas. I love the Salsa bar, it is quite flavourful, and I think I prefer the salsa here to Guadalajaras salsa. The staff that work here are all men whilst Guadalajara has women. The cooks will shout your number when your order is ready and they want you in and out as quickly as possible. But when you are super hungry and puckish El Farolito certainly does the trick. Id give it more stars if it stood out a bit more from Guadalajara but I chose to go there first and Taq stood out a bit more to me.I like that they offer Cilantro and Onion separately!!!

True story:One night years ago, a friend came over depressed about his current relationship. Being a good friend, I sat there listening and offering support. Now mind you, I consider myself a very good listener. So I sat there and let them vent while I listened... And listened... And listened...My stomach began to rumble, but I sat there and listened... And listened... And listened.As they spoke, I began to have a conversation with myself in my head. &#34;They&#39;re really going through rough times and you&#39;re being a great friend right now&#34;... &#34;Okay, say something really wise and make them feel better so that we can talk about something else&#34;... &#34;Oh man, was that my stomach? (Glancing at my watch) Fack, it&#39;s been 5 hours since I last ate. I hope we wrap up soon&#34;... &#34;Jesus, they won&#39;t stop talking. I&#39;m getting light headed. I think I&#39;m gonna pass out&#34;... &#34;Oh my God! Stop talking! Please! Just stop it already!&#34;... &#34;If I collapse from starvation right now, I wonder if they&#39;d notice&#34;...And you know what I was dreaming about during this grueling time? El Farolito.I&#39;ve been coming here for about 20 years and this place has never let me down. And in my moment of near starvation, I wanted my last meal to be a super suiza from El Farolito.

Now this is what I call tacos! I&#39;ve been coming here since high school in the late 90&#39;s, and they haven&#39;t changed a bit (this is a good thing)I must admit, I used to be thrown off by the the fact that their decor consists of scantily clad pics of Thalia, and big-busomed Aztecan ladies with Mexican flags draped across their chests, but now it&#39;s all part of the whole experience.Here&#39;s what to expect:- Their definition of &#34;hot&#34; is consistent with what it is in Mexico, which means hot=burns your taste buds off, mild=hot, and mild=a little spicy. Please take note of this when they ask you want kind of salsa you want on your tacos.- Ceviche tostadas are damn good. They put minced jalapenos in them and they are hot (refer to definition above)- Burritos are big and they don&#39;t skimp on the meat. Good balance between dry (rice, meat) and wet (sour cream, salsa, cheese, guacamole)- Free chips and they have a salsa bar - win!- Good selection of aguas frecas - horchata, agua de Jamaica (hibiscus water for you non-spanish speakers, agua de melon (melon juice)- Tacos come in a variety of sizes to suit your taste - from plain old meat, oninos and cilantro to supreme tacos with sour cream and all- Plenty of seating inside- They&#39;re open really late so it&#39;s the perfect place to hit up after the club to fill up your belly so you don&#39;t get a hangover ;)- Nachos are ridiculously huge and chock full of toppings - they are really meant for two people, or one really greedy oneI haven&#39;t met anyone who doesn&#39;t love this place. The Excelsior wouldn&#39;t be the Excelsior without it.

We are lucky to live in San Francisco where we can get real, authentic indigenous food.Here on Mission Street, from 16th all the way down to Geneva, there are plenty of good Taquerias to choose from. However, on the corner of Mission and Onondega, there are two good Taqueria joints to choose from, and they are directly across from each other.Hey, it&#39;s a win-win situation since if one place is busy, you can mosey on over to the other side. And they are both scrumptiously delicious.El Farolito is very excellent and consistent. They are open very, very, very late and they always come in handy when that late night craving for some burritos and tacos hits you. It doesn&#39;t have to be the munchies or smoke some herb to get that craving. Y&#39;all know what I&#39;m talking about. Man, when that craving hits, you gotta satisfy that craving....pronto.Since they open late at night, there are plenty of parking to choose from; but I can guarantee you that there will be a long line. In fact, always expect a long line for something this good.Fitting name since El Farolito is translated into mini or little lighthouse. Hey, it&#39;s a beacon for everyone who gets that craving late at night and guides us safely to their door.

SUPER QUESADILLA!!I devoured this within 10 minutes because it was so bomb. Their quesadillas are flat shaped and the tortilla is so crisp! I loved how their quesadillas are flat and they still manage to have the freshest, tastiest, ingredients in their burrito without everything oozing out whenever you bite into it. Their quesadillas consist of the typical sour cream, carne asada, cheese, guacamole. Love how their cheese is all melted in the quesadilla allowing all the flavors to mix and stick together. Especially love their guacamole! Unlike most places they use pre-made packed guacamole. El Farolito uses REAL avocados! I saw them peeling and scooping from avocados! What a plus!Their burrito looked just as enticing as the quesadilla but I obviously could not eat THAT much (well maybe I can...but portion control). They give you chips too before you receive your meal.What&#39;s so awesome about this place is it is one of those late nighter places. The perfect place to get your drunk munchies on or even sober munchies on. They open till really late and still manages to serve the freshest, hot cooked food to their customers! YUM. Yay for Mexican foooood!

There&#39;s a lot of hype surrounding this taqueria so I was destined to go try it out since I&#39;m working my way up the burrito ladder.Carne asada super burrito is the go-to choice for my burrito adventures and this was slightly disappointing.- Size is good but definitely not HUGE like most people say- Carne asada was flavorful and juicy but there wasnt much of it- Meat:Everything else ratio was totally off. I felt like I was eating beans and rice half of the timeI think Guadalajara has Farolito beat in the super burrito category. Although one of my favorite burritos would still have to be the Farolito in San Jose, the forgotten Farolito located in the shady parking lot sandwiched between a 7-11 and Andrew Hill High School.

Took the visiting familia from NYC here for dinner tonight. They wanted &#34;real-authentic-california&#34; mexican food. I knew this had to be some where on the Mission. While I yelped this place previously, my brother highly recommended it! I told the familia that true-authentic means ordering at the counter and no waiter service. Like legit, hole in the wall. I was for real.However, the food was good! Everything is cooked fresh and has really nice ingredients. I had the enchilladas, one carne asada and one chorizo. I enjoyed the chorizo lotsss. Yum! Also ordered Super Nachos, they were SUPER and huge! Enough to feed three hungry people. The quesadillas look great too.Cheap food! Fast food! Good food! Yums!

OMG I LOVE THIS PLACE! why did it take me THIS long to find out about this!?My friends and I came here after a long day of wine tasting in Napa and it was scrumptious! They take card (so no need for cash, though it&#39;s preferable). They have a HUGE selection of dishes and meats, including tongue!Their meats are delicious- very juicy, tender, and perfectly seasoned. The aroma alone just makes your mouth water. I will definitely return here whenever I&#39;m in the city!

This has been my OG Mex fix for a long time! Been coming here for as long as I can remember. Right in the Mission Excelsior District, El Farolito is this is the best Mex in my opinion. Portions are big and burritos you probably can share. The nachos have always been my favorite. They take cash/credit card so no worries. I like coming here in the middle of the day when no one is here. Chips and salsa while you wait.

Been enjoying this delicious place since before high school! The prices are very affordable and the food portions are generous. I can&#39;t even finish a whole super burrito to myself (which is something I recommend for you to try).I usually get the carne asada super burrito with black beans. When I&#39;m feeling daring, I&#39;ll add shrimp. Another great dish for you to try is the super carne asada (and/or shrimp) quesadilla. Don&#39;t forget to add the fresh strawberry fresca too! YUM!!

The service was great and we&#39;re very nice on my visit. I ordered the enchilada plate, a regular taco de asada and a super taco de asada. I was disappointed with the enchiladas bc the enchilada sauce was just poured over them. I&#39;m used to having the tortilla dipped in the enchilada sauce then frying it in a pan so the tortilla really absorbs the flavor. The enchilada sauce had no flavor, I had to pour a lot of their chip salsa to give it a kick. The enchiladas were a little cold as well. The rest on the plate (rice and beans) were good and warm. The tacos were ok. I think the carne asada could use a little more salt or maybe seasoning.I think I&#39;ll stick to the quesadillas de chorizo. Side note, the bathrooms were cleaner that what I&#39;d thought they&#39;d be so good job on that.

We came here around 10pm after a whole Sunday of hitting the studies (so sad) and their burritos really hit the spot. We just got the regular carne asada burritos, but man, if we came later into the night, I&#39;m sure we&#39;d love it even more. The guys behind the counter were so awesome, and one of them actually brought our food to us (sorry guys!) because we didn&#39;t hear them call our number since we sat so far away from the register. So grateful that they did that though!!

I grew up in this neighborhood and was always faithful, but through the years they became very stingy with what they put in the burrito. I ordered a carne asada super burrito with extra sour cream. Half way through the burrito, there was no sour cream. When I approached the cashier about it they told me the sour cream is on the other side of the burrito and if I wanted even more I would have to pay another dollar in addition to what I originally paid for the extra. Uh. No thanks, you can find me at Guadalajara across the street.

Late night food and not interested in Denny&#39;s/iHop? This is the spot. Especially if you&#39;re craving Mexican cuisine! Burritos, Nachos, Quesadillas, Tacos, etc.Of course coming here for lunch is good too, but there are so many other options, so this is where it shines during the late night. If I&#39;m feeling hungry I&#39;ll go for a super carne asada burrito which comes out super hot... and when I&#39;m eating the salsa and chips the compounding combination of spice and heat is just too overbearing!if I&#39;m looking for a light hit in my stomach, I&#39;ll order a regular carne asada taco and get chips, and this does save $, less than $3!Not to mention their strawberry fresca is really good. This is definitely one of my favorite spots to be at for late night cravings.*Cash and Credit/Debit is accepted*Parking: street parking, no lot

This place rocks all times of the day from lunch to dinner, to 3am after he bar binges.Venue is on mission, and its whatever. Kind of whole in the wall but it doesnt smell or have rats running around.Service: all the workers are quick, nice, and awesome latinos.Food: BOMB, burritos, tacos, all good. I love the super quesadilla suiza, and add on atleast two tacos of either carnitas or carne asada. All the meats are awesome, and the portion sizes are great for the price. Im a huge fan of this place and always tip. Its no san diego, but makes me feel closer to home everytime i come here.

My go to spot since it&#39;s open late and the food is very satisfying. I usually order a super burrito/quesadilla/nacho el pastor with everything on it. Whichever I am in the mood for. You get lots of rice and beans with the burrito, the quesadilla has chunks of avocado, and the nachos is possibly the larger of the 3 in terms of portion. Get one if those, and a drink (fresca). I like the watermelon, since it&#39;s refreshing and not overly sweet. But that&#39;s only if they don&#39;t have cantaloup.People compare it to the place across the street, Guadalajara, both are good. But my cousin prefers el farolito since they cook the shrimp in front of you. Not sure guads does that.

I usually do not like to give bad ratings, but this is long over due. I just got home from ordering a super burrito to go and they messed up on my order, AGAIN. I am soooo tired of this happening. It&#39;s been happening a lot lately. I&#39;ve been going to this place for more than 10 years now and their burritos are usually very good and juicy when it&#39;s made the way it&#39;s ordered. They used to really care about customer service. I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on with this place now. The last time they messed up on my order, I wasted gas and time and I drove back to the restaurant just so they can make the burrito I actually ordered. This burrito they made me today is the driest burrito I&#39;ve ever had in my life. I wonder if they are under new management or something because their burritos and their customer service isn&#39;t as great as it used to be. It&#39;s to bad. I used to love this place.

Go to Guadalajara across the street !!!! Or better yet just cruise along mission for some other more appetizing dishes.Smh.

Stopped here Monday night at around 10:45pm and the place was busy. Waited in a short line and ordered our grub.The staff were friendly and professional, and seemed pleased with my friend ordering in Spanish.Grabbed a table, had a chance to look around, the place is a little run down, tables and seats have noticeable wear and tear, but it gets the job done. They have two flat screen TV&#39;s playing a Spanish channel.We ordered a steak quesadilla and shared, it came with chips, which I wasn&#39;t impressed with. The main dish was pretty tasty. The meat was mostly tender and had a good flavor (not a spice, but actual flavor) and it was HUGE. Yum.I really enjoyed their Horchata. It was grainy with a soft hint of cinnamon and I could clearly taste the vanilla as it&#39;s own flavor. My preference is the more grainy Horchata, it&#39;s a rice drink after all!Chile was also good. We had all of them, the only one lacking spice was of course the Verde, but it still had a solid flavour.Bathrooms were actually really clean, but had no toilet seat covers.When we left at around 11:30pm the line was almost out the door, but they had them moving fast.

There are countless taquerias in the Mission, how would you know which one to try? Well, you would have to know someone that live in the area or judge it by the lines of hungry patrons. I did both, and I am not disappointed. After having 2 bad experiences at Taqueria Menudo, I finally gave this spot a try and I am hooked! I&#39;ve only tried the regular shrimp burrito but I cannot wait to try the rest of the menu. My burrito was done super quick and always tasted right. I also love that they open until 2:30am on the weekends, for those drunk club goers that needed to sober up before getting their ass home!

I came here for a burrito late night because Taqueria Guadalajara was closed across the street. I must say it was tasty and slightly bigger than across the street. The reason a 3 star is they put way too much sour cream in the burrito and it seems quite dry. Good for a quick late bite but I still prefer to have my GUADS whenever opened.

Came in for a late night snack and WOW! Had to order another one for myself after eating half of my boyfriend&#39;s burrito (and this is coming from a girl with a small appetite). Their super carne asada burritos were burning hot! They cook the meat as you order them and bring them to your table for you. Of course, there was a short line (maybe 5 or so minutes of wait?) but it was worth it!

This Mexican restaurant is a:- Late night food run after the club- I&#39;m hungry but I don&#39;t want to drive far from the Excelsior area- I don&#39;t have a lot of money but I&#39;m craving Mexican foodtype of place..I always order the Super Shrimp burrito. It&#39;s less than $10 for each meal and the portions are HUUUUUUGE! One burrito can feed me 3x and be super full each time.It says it comes with 12 pieces of shrimp but I think they put more! The shrimps are not small either so it&#39;s definitely a shrimpy surprise. They are open until 3-4am some nights which is why I listed those reasons up there and I give it a 2 star rating because they are dirty.One night I saw the cooks mess around and throw a wet rag or paper towel at each other, kind of like in a basketball throw motion but he missed his friend and it made it into one of the pots that they were cooking in. The guy noticed me looking and they closed the restaurant for the night earlier than usual. GROSS.I still come here. The food is pretty good and some places are just plain dirty. Not all restaurants are perfect.

This is my favorite of the El Farolito locations. The staff is super friendly and I think the food just tastes a lot better here. You can also get guacamole too which isn&#39;t an option at 24th st.Consistency is a little bit hit or miss sometimes but most of the time it&#39;s good.

I feel as though I should have so much to say about this joint because its so delicious, but I dont, maybe the best things arent described in words, but are felt in the heart when youre chewing with a mouthful of heaven. el farolito is open super later, a good amount of seating, one of the best burittos in town. dont forget the green sauce.

The best Taqueria in San Francisco, descent prices and anything you order is delicious, open late nights and even more during the weekends for those party animals! Casual ambiance and clean. TV&#39;s available playing sports the fellas would like. The staff is great and respectful. No parking provided so you own your own for that! Although it shouldn&#39;t take too long to find parking. Cheers to all!

Eh. I have so many friends in SF and have heard so many &#34;omg..you gotta try El Farlito&#39;s..&#34; that I had to try it. And of course, i had to try it after drunken debauchery....and SADLY, all I have to say is EH.Yep. EH!Other than the extreme size of the burrito, I wasn&#39;t blown away by it&#39;s taste or thought it was anything special.Or maybe I wasn&#39;t drunk enough to enjoy it.....?

I grew up around here, and used to go to Guadalajara until someone forced me to eat at El Farolito&#39;s. Unless you live around the area or this is the nearest Mexican food joint around should you be in this neighborhood. Fa real.So my decision to switch to El Farolito and abandon their arch nemesis across the street? Mehhh I&#39;m still in between!! El Farolito&#39;s carnitas aren&#39;t dry, Guadalajara&#39;s? Kind of dry. Deduction of stars because I can&#39;t sit comfortably in there, like I hold on to my belongings real tight and I&#39;m always looking at the door. Space could be cleaner, thiiings like that. And I don&#39;t feel like that in Guadalajara.

OMG! this place is the best! Good cheap eat!! Opens late, till around 3, 4am? The area can be a little rough, but just go in, eat your delicious meal and get out.The bf and i came after i got off work around 11pm and I didn&#39;t eat dinner so we came. We ordered the SUPER NACHOS!!! omg...cheese, beans, salsa, gauc, sour cream, and your choice of meat, for $6-7? There&#39;s nothing you can go wrong. The two of us combined could not finish it. Everytime you order, you get a small handful of chips, with all you can eat salsa. There&#39;s the reg red color one, the green one, and my fav the pico de gallo which is the fresh salsa.I&#39;ve also had the tacos or somtimes i order the toastada? which is a crunchy flat taco for i think $3? and with the chips and FREE pico de gallo, i&#39;m stuffed. Absolutely love the price, the food is delicious and freshly made to order, what more can you ask for??? YUMMMM

Late night, cheap eats. Late night, good, cheap eats.Entertainment as well because everyone else around you has also partook in weekend debauchery. This one is the better location IMO because it has more seating and less aggression (I&#39;ve experienced first hand unpleasantness at the other loc in addition to hearing stories from friends)Big portions too in case you&#39;re too lazy to cook/go to brunch in the morning. It&#39;s a win win.

We stopped in here craving something quick.I decided on a couple tacos, lengua and tripe. Both were satisfying and hit the spot, but the flavors weren&#39;t too memorable the ingredients weren&#39;t as fresh as I would&#39;ve hoped.The thing that bothered me here was the cashier asking over and over and over (three times) if I wanted any of the chips. No thanks, I&#39;ll pass on the store bought chips. Once, twice and a final third time sir.Good, but not on my rotation list for tacos and burritos. Too many other good options in the city!

This is probably as authentic as it gets! Hands down one of the best burritos I&#39;ve ever had, every last bite had so much flavor!I got the pollo asada regular burrito, but it was a decent size. I couldn&#39;t even finish it! The strawberry agua fresca was also really good, the perfect beverage to wash down the awesome burrito with!Salsa bar is also awesome, and the atmosphere is so absolutely authentic. The service was just fine. The line moved quickly even though it was long, and the food was also ready rather quickly.I&#39;ll definitely be back!

I&#39;ll get straight to the point- the burrito wasn&#39;t bad, had I been more familiar with the menu I&#39;m sure I&#39;d be blown away. Folks were nice, chips were good.One thing that was a big turn off was that they did not have any spicy sauce. What taqueria lacks on hot sauce? I don&#39;t know, but I doubt I&#39;ll come back. At least we gave this place a try.

There must have been a change in customer service bc they really do suck!!For one, when a customer calls in to place an order, make sure you take down their name and number so orders aren&#39;t lost.And two; When running the cashier, being bilingual helps. Not everyone that walks into a Taqueria speaks Spanish. *It took us 15 minutes just to place our order bc he couldn&#39;t understand what I was saying and vice versa.*I&#39;m going to have to brush up on my Spanish :)THANKS to all the cooks working swiftly to get all of the orders out in 5-10 minutes flat. They definitely keep this place running :)

Very popular late night spot in the Excelsior district, since there&#39;s not many alternatives in the neighborhood. There&#39;s plenty of seats for all the inebriated clientele, but to go seemed like a popular choice.I tried carnitas, cabeza, and lengua tacos. Carnitas was pretty dry, not very good. Cabeza and lengua were decent, moist and beefy.The salsa bar looked a bit unsanitary, with a cleaning rag hanging out right on the front edge. Some of the tasty salsa verde had spilled into the oregano spiced pico de gallo as well.Chips are grainy, store bought and a good way for the restaurant to limit the intake of their salsa verde, however I found away around that and used it for my tacos.Quesadilla suiza and super tacos seemed to be popular choices. I was warned to stay away from the al pastor.

Recommend:Carne Asada burrito or Al Pastor. Both very tasty and filling.Tip: They put cilantro in their burritos, so if you aren&#39;t a fan order without.Pros- One of the top Mexican joints in the city- Multiple locations around the bay- Convenience: open til 2:30 weekdays, 3:30- weekends- Good especially after bar or club hopping in the city -- Open almost every day of the year (with a few days off)ConsLike most parking in the city can be a hassle.I haven&#39;t been there in awhile but when I used to go often it is always the same guys working there. They are consistent and make the food how you want it.

This place kicks major ass. The burritos here are huge and come with chips. Price is around $6-$7. Literally the best in the city. Plus, the guys who work here are super friendly if you talk to them. If you talk to them in Spanish they will love you forever. Especially if you don&#39;t speak spanish.I used to come here on a weekly basis as a CCSF student on the Ocean Campus. Way better than the crap they&#39;ve got on campus (minus the Pierre Coste Restaurant, that place is awesome).

One word to describe the food: salty.I don&#39;t care if people have raved about this place for years or what great things El Farolito has to offer. The meat is salty and I felt like I was in the desert searching for that mirage of a pool of water with a palm tree hanging over it. The only reason why people come here is either because it&#39;s open late or people are drunk and want something to eat. I&#39;ve been here twice and I think that&#39;s plenty of times for me to confidently say that I don&#39;t want to make another trip down here again.

I&#39;ve been coming here since about 5 years ago with my mom and her friend, who showed me this wonderful taqueria in the first place. I used to go there on a weekly basis or so for about 2 years or so, then eventually, I stopped going for a while, for reasons I can&#39;t seem to remember. Anyways, recently, starting about a 2-3 months ago, I started going there on a weekly basis again.Everything there seems to be the same. The same great tasting food, the same friendly atmosphere, and the same good ol&#39; friendly customer service. Whenever I go there, the only thing I really order is the Carne Asada Super Suiza. For roughly $7, it fills me up for lunch and dinner. In fact, whenever I go there, it&#39;s the only and single meal I eat the entire day. Everything&#39;s very convenient, made quick, fresh, and ready to go. In addition to this, chips are also included for free too! The salsa bar is a little &#34;wattery&#34; but that isn&#39;t too much of an issue. All in all, it&#39;s great authentic Mexican food! Large proportions, great prices, and quick and fast friendly service!

To the owner or manager of this particular location. Let me first start by saying your food is delicious! I&#39;ve lived in the Excelsior district for the past 28 years and ever since I&#39;ve had a job and my very first paychecks, I have always enjoyed your burritos and super nachos.With that made clear. The reason I have unfortunately placed two stars for this review is plain and simple. It is 6:35 on the night of October 26th and I have probably had the worst service I&#39;ve ever had here. I don&#39;t expect much and I&#39;ve had some so so experiences here but never anything that has made me take time out of my day to write a negative review. The cashier you have right now is just horrible. Seemed annoyed with any question I had. I don&#39;t want to say much more. I just want to let you know he shouldn&#39;t be on the register. I am not the type of person to say I will never be back but I WILL use the power of my dollar and debate whether to go in when he is at the register. The taqueria across the street has pretty good food too.

I wish this place was good, but it is not. Their late hours make them popular I guess, but their vegi burritos are among the worst in town - and I&#39;ve done a lot of research on the subject. The beans (which are often under cooked), the rice (which is often soapy tasting), the salsa all taste like they&#39;ve had a shaker of salt dumped into it. The portions are huge, but given that the food is bad that&#39;s not exactly a selling point. Plus the prices vary up to 2 dollars for the same burrito depending on who&#39;s working. I do not recommend.

El Farolito: my 3am mistressI&#39;ll admit it. El Farolito definitely hits the spot after a hard night of drunken debauchery. I&#39;m sure there has to be some science behind the pleasures of a boozy burrito or a noshed nachos. I came here with a friend at 2:30am and ordered a plate of lengua nachos while my friend ordered the carne asada burrito. The food came out fast and we were half way through everything by 2:40am before we even realized what had happened. Sure, I was full and sated but I wasn&#39;t very excited. I&#39;m not sure if that was a good thing or not, since the meal was simply forgettable. I wasn&#39;t particularly blown away by anything and I was drunk. When I&#39;m drunk, I get blown away pretty easily. They could have snuck a jalapeno into my nachos and I would have ran around the taqueria like Speedy Gonzales, pretending my fingers were six shooters. Luckily for my dignity, they didn&#39;t.While my nachos were good, they were just that: good. I couldn&#39;t vouch for El Farolito like many of the die-hard fans who live and die by their Super Suiza Quesadilla or their Carne Asada Burrito. Will I be coming back here for a bite? Maybe. Maybe not. Perhaps, on another boozy night in the city, I&#39;ll be back. So if you hear shrills and screams coming from some Asian guy at 3am, don&#39;t worry. They just snuck a jalapeno into my nachos.

I had the biggest breakfast burrito of my life here the other day. It was delicious! I was full and should&#39;ve put it down about halfway thru, but it was so good that I just devoured the whole damn thing. I wasn&#39;t the least bit of hungry for nearly 12 hours, no joke. So if you&#39;re on a budget and want to be full for most of the day for less than $10, get a breakfast burrito here!

If you&#39;re looking for taqueria standards done right, it&#39;s hard to find a better place than El Farolito. The food is flavorful and priced reasonably. Excellent veggie burritos with avocado and black beans. And if your body is up for the oil and calories, the chile relleno burrito is preposterously delicious.I only wish that they had some slightly smaller, cheaper plate options, as their plates are daunting for dinner, and insurmountable for lunch. (I suppose I could also wish for the self restraint to just eat half and save the rest for later.) Also, having to pay 50 cents extra for chips is a bummer, but the service is fast enough that chips are pretty unnecessary.

This place is next to my girlfriend&#39;s place, which is perfect for late night food runs!They have all the basics, from carne asada to lengua, tasting as authentic as it can get out here in SF. My favorite are the quesadillas because they pack so much between two flour tortillas flavor explode in your mouth with every bite. If you LOVE cheese (like me) you HAVE to get it.One drawback are the chips. They are corn chips, not bad.. but I do prefer the classical flour chip. I ordered nachos one night and man it was so hard to eat with the corn chips =[

Yes, the burrito here is good. That has been established. But what about their TORTAS?!?!?!? Fucking awesome. They easily rank as some of my most favorite in the city.Torta highlights:1) They cook the cheese directly on the grill creating that slightly crispy cheese love.2) They use thin slices of carne asada rather than chopping it up. It really does something to the texture of the sando.3) They use delicious fresh bread and tons of avocado and jalepenos.This sandwich is pure love. Try it, but take it to go. This location is quite grimy and pretty lacking in any atmosphere (hence only 4 stars).

SIMPLY the BEST Burrito in SF, making it the best BURRITO in the BAY AREA, making it the BEST Burrito in CALIFORNIA, MAKING IT THE BEST BURRITO In the WORLD.I was born and raise in SF&#39;s Mission District, so i know burrito&#39;s. I call this place La Mecca, because it is truly the holy land of burritos.Its got the size, ts got the taste, and the serivce is so quick, you might get your burrito before you settle in your seat!There are many El Farolito&#39;s but this one is by far my favorit. (followed by 24th and Alabama, and then 24th and mission)if there is one thing they could improve its the consistency of the salsa Verde, sometimes it too hot, sometimes it needs more of a kick, but then you have nights were its perfect!

After returning here late last night for my umpteenth time, thought I would jot it down.Taquerias don&#39;t get any better than this joint. The chips are good, the salsa&#39;s always fresh and because they have a salsa bar, you can get verde, picante, fresca, basically whatever your little heart desires.Since so many other taqueria joints have decent burritos but lousy tacos, I always get the carna asada (soft tacos) here. They are just done dead on. The tortilla is soft and hot, the meat is off the hook and smoking hot off the grill, and the taco has just the right amount of onions, cilantro and hot sauce on it. Perfecto!! My mouth is watering just typing this. I can&#39;t go back again tonight, can I? Can I????

Late night brain food? More like a night cap!I used to use this place as an excuse for brain food for my late nights studying, but always ended up sprawled out on my bed post-meal. So crammers, beware of failed exams or half completed essays.I LOVE THIS PLACE! When I first moved to the area, a couple of people suggested this place - after the first bite, it was love.Suggestions:Super quesadilla with carne asada.Super quesadilla with carnitas (WINNER)Tacos with carnitas.I used to always get the Super Quesadilla with carne asada, but after trying it with carnitas it was no turning back!YOU MUST get the salsa - I want to say it&#39;s pico de gallo, anyway it is BOMB.COM. Add a kick of lemon/lime and it&#39;s smooth eating from there.Once you order, you can watch them slap on the ingredients - everything is fresh and plentiful.In comparison to a lot of other taquerias I&#39;ve eaten at, this is by far my top fav! It&#39;s a perfect balance of ingredients. Not too salty, soggy, or bland. Some places are a hit or miss with the meats too - I noticed that sometimes it would taste like wet dog. (ok I&#39;ve never tasted a wet dog, but I would think that&#39;s what it would taste like). This place, however, has consistent delicious meat.For those who have had La Victoria&#39;s in San Jose, buy a bottle of their orange sauce and lay it on a meal from here.

BEST SHRIMP TACOS EVER!Every time I come here, try as I might, I can&#39;t leave without ordering a shrimp taco. These tacos come with salsa, bell peppers, cilantros, onions, and of course 6 giant, juicy shrimp! All thrown atop two tiny tortillas that can barely hold all of the ingredients together. The salsa is BOMB and has just the right amount of kick to it; these tacos definitely wouldn&#39;t be half as good without it.The old, grungy &#34;tables and benches&#34; feel of this place gives it lots of character. They&#39;re open late which great for people who live in the neighborhood because not much else is.Had to subtract a star because their burritos are pretty underwhelming to me. Yes, they&#39;re huge and you definitely get the bang for your buck, but taste-wise, they&#39;re just alright.

People have been raving about El Farolito since I&#39;ve told them I&#39;m now in SF. Apparently deemed the best burrito place around, I was expecting mouth-watering, must-have, food-orgasmic burritos. Maybe it was too hyped up for me to really be impressed, but while El Farolito&#39;s is good, it wasn&#39;t as spectacular as everyone made it out to be.The food quality is very good. I ordered the carnitas burrito and their carnitas tasted fresh and had good flavour. Overall the burrito was good. Also, when I think super burrito, I think of a larger burrito - not a burrito with added guac and sour cream and the same size.There&#39;s definitely better burritos out there where you can get more for your money, but I guess those are in SoCal and this is one of the better places up here.Still good, probably great drunk food, definitely coming back if I do need a burriot fix.

MMMM.. El Farolito! Two words: Wet Burrito. It&#39;s their normal huge burrito topped with enchilada sauce and a fresh tomato slice. The sauce has a sweet and tangy taste to it that is so good! The whole thing lasts me at least two meals, sometimes three. You also get a free side of tortilla chips.Okay, so I admit I haven&#39;t really ventured much around their menu because I have always stuck to the wet burrito, but why would I when it is so good. This is the place to go for a late night bite or a morning after hangover cure.

I hate secrets. What I hate more than secrets are things that are only slightly secretive but should be damn obvious! GRRRR El Farolito&#39;s salsa here is really really good and I can&#39;t seem to stay away:( the food here is also exceptionally deliicious.I always order the regular taco: just tortilla, meat, cilantro and salsa. How can something so simple be SOOO ADDICTING. oddly two is enough to fill me up though i always want to order more just for the satisfaction of having delicious food pile up before me, but I don&#39;t think my boyfriend would appreciate sitting with a cow stuffing her face with more than she can chew. He always orders the super burrito with rice, beans, meat, guac, cheese and of course top it with SALSAAAA. Try it, you&#39;ll never want to try anything else.

My weekly burrito lunch land here, which is also happen to be my 800th review. We can endlessly debate on the best overall taqueria. Whether it&#39;s the two 24th St. locations or the outer-Mission location, El Farolito is by a huge-margin my favorite taqueria in the entire Bay Area. And it&#39;s also a favorite of Yelp&#39;s with the sticker visibly on the glass door.The quiet outer-Mission restaurant is bigger and a lot cleaner than the two busy 24th St. locations. But all three locations make some good meats to form some amazing super burrito, tacos, nachos and quesadilla.I stuck with what El Farolito specializes and cooks best; which is the Carne Asada (Grilled Steak) Super-burrito. For $6.00, the super silver bullet has choices from one of their tasty meats and beans, rice, cheese, guacamole and sour cream in a flour tortilla. The two busy 24th street location charge $.50 for a basket or bag of tortilla chip. But with this location, the chips are also included with our meal and refills are also free. The tasty and greasy filling in my colorful burrito, make a great dip for the endless chips.I believe all three locations including the outer-Mission location, in which I paid my meal, are &#34;cash only&#34;. I&#39;m so happy that I made my 800th review to my favorite taqueria in the Bay Area.

The only place in town where I go for burritos and quesadillas. Been coming here for almost 10 years now, and the food always taste consistent. I have never been dissatisfied eating here. I usually come late night.The guy that takes your order is very nice. He greets you with a smile. So if you&#39;re thinking about some good burritos or quesadillas. Give El farolitos a try, you won&#39;t be disappointed.

Usually I&#39;ll get a super burrito with carnitas and no salsa in it. The ingredients here are very fresh and i&#39;m glad that they use fresh avocados that are sliced very nicely. I think it&#39;s probably one of the best burrito joints in the city hands down.

Since my introduction to El Farolito, I come here a lot. And I do mean a lot. Because I live nearby, it&#39;s no problem for me to drive by when the hunger pangs call and I feel like eating something really really bad for me at 12-am.I&#39;ve noticed that since coming here these past few years the quality has gone down a little and I no longer want to finish the other half of my Super Carne Asada Burrito. Instead, I&#39;ve been getting the Super Carne Asada Tacos instead. Just the right proportions for me and a little lighter than the super burrito.Their salsa bar is awesome, especially the pico di gallo. It has the perfect amount of heat. I love that I can get as much as I want because I use so much it&#39;s like I drink the stuff. Speaking of drinks, the Strawberry Aqua Fresca is sooo good. It&#39;s the real stuff, cause when you get to the bottom, you get all the seeds and everything.

I was skeptical when my sister MADE me come here to try their tacos. But boy, they are DELICIOUSLY TO DIE FOR! I swear it&#39;s better than the Socal/San Diego joints that everyone raves about. So good!We tried a few of their tacos with different meats, and they were all delicious! We were stuffed with 2 tacos each, but my sister insisted we get an al pastor burrito to go because it&#39;s THAT good. The Chile Verde was my FAVORITE! A few hours later, when it was cold, I took my first bite. Boy, it was DELICIOUS (and it was no longer fresh and hot!)I am so ready to go back and eat their burritos, and perhaps try their quesadillas too. Too bad my stomach can only fit so much food... :(

GDG: GOD DAMN GREAT! I tried both places El Farolito and Taqueria Guadalajara (Across the street) on the same day and El Farolito definitely won out! The tacos, despite being $2.25 each, they have loads of meat piled a good 2 or 3 inches on their tacos. It was amazing! The pastor was the best I&#39;ve had in the bay! and the best I&#39;ve had since leaving Los Angeles! The chile verde and the carnitas are right up there for #2 and #3 favorite behind the al pastor! The carna asada was so-so.Pros:- GDG: GOD DAMN GREAT Food- Loads of meat on the tacos- Friendly Staff- Clean (for this type of restaurant)Cons:- $2.25 for a taco (usually $1.25 at other places)Overall: RECOMMENDED! Definitely better than Taqueria Guadalajara across the street!p.s. I WILL BE BACK! IT&#39;S SO GOOD!

I&#39;m used to the round tortillas cut into quarters. Theirs are wrapped without the ends tucked in, so watch out for food falling out!

I must admit, as some people have a &#34;sweet tooth&#34; I consider myself to have a &#34;burrito tooth&#34;. I get random cravings for burritos amidst other meals that I could only conclude it&#39;s my hidden &#34;burrito tooth&#34; calling for a craving.Anyway, I&#39;ve had a fair share of weak burritos and burritos that shouldn&#39;t even be classified as a burrito, so when the whole world told me that I should try El Farolito for the best Mexican food, I did not hesitate. El Farolito definitely hasn&#39;t failed me since the first time I tried them. So far I&#39;ve tried their quesadillas, nachos, burritos and most recently their tacos.So here&#39;s the life changing moment. As I mentioned I&#39;m an avid burrito fan, BUT despite having the &#34;baby&#34; burrito size I can never seem to finish an entire burrito! And I&#39;m not really the cold food left over type of girl so I had to make minor adjustments to pleasing my &#34;burrito tooth&#34;-- I realized that perhaps it was just a &#34;Mexican food tooth&#34; rather than a &#34;burrito tooth&#34; because the last time I went to El Farolito my friend persuaded me to get the tacos instead of a burrito. At first I was a little skeptical. I mean I&#39;ve tried tacos at other places and those things seem TINY. I thought that investing my money into a burrito would be the best choice because despite the fact that I can never finish it whole, I&#39;d still be fulfilled. But somehow, I decided it was time for a change and just go with the taco instead.I went with the shrimp taco since shrimp never seems to fail. When my plate came, I already felt disappointed. I thought a six year old could eat this plate and still would have hunger pangs, but I was wrong! One shrimp taco from El Farolito does wonders. You know the story where Jesus keeps mass producing bread and fish for his people out of no where? I swear that is exactly what El Farolito&#39;s shrimp taco did for me. Even though the plate looked like it was little, somehow the Jesus behind the El Farolito kept providing me with fulfilling goodness that I was stuffed with just one taco. But to say the least, the day I tried El Farolito&#39;s shrimp taco was by far the most life changing event ever.

When late night munchies called in one time you see I had to quench my appetite after the bar. My brain ran like Speedy Gonzales from eating here because the Carne Asada tacos with the amount of chips and options of salsa provided hit the spot. The nachos were good too despite the messiness but hey I&#39;ll still eat it! Overall the prices are a great value because the food is really legit.

Boy oh boy! For some real good, cheap eats, especially on the late night creep, this is the place! Those who know, know that El Farolito is one of the go-to spots after a night out on the town.I went to the Giants game last Friday and had the best seats ever (at least for me that is). Right after, I was initially craving a burrito but when I got to the spot, I opted for a grande quesadilla suiza. I tell ya, I am never let down when I order this. Fulfilling...to say the least. Topping it off with a nice large horchata to wash it all down. Nothing fancy here, just good ole authentic Mexican food.

El Farolito is a Mission classic! Pretty much the best taqueria in SF, in my opinion.My favorite thing to get there is the simple burrito with boiled chicken. Now most folks will get their burrito meats grilled, and I&#39;ll admit boiled chicken doesn&#39;t sound as appetizing, but trust me. The liquid they use to boil the chicken leaves it both tasty and juicy and it&#39;s WHITE meat. No mean feat to keep white meat juicy.Great for late night, as that&#39;s how most people were introduced to it no doubt. But it&#39;s great for lunch as well.Financial District people here&#39;s an idea... if you close to BART in the Fi-Di, then your just a short ten minute BART ride to El Farolito which is right at the top of 24th Street/Mission BART. Skip that crappy Financial District burrito and get yourself the REAL DEAL!

One of the most popular late night drunchies stops. Huge portions at a good price. I always get the carne asada quesadilla or burrito, both of which pretty much have the same ingredients but are contained by their tortillas differently. Hits the spot when a mexican food craving plagues me. Would recommend to friends.

I can never finish it, but I love having it as leftovers for the next day.I like how they&#39;re open late and how service is quick.

My favorite taqueria hands down! Nom nom nom burnt steak and gooey cheese.....DROOLS!A loyal customer since circa 1998! They have the most delish steak and shrimp burrito! I drench it in salsa verde and limes. A must try is the steak super nachos with no beans, add rice, comes with salsa, gooey white cheese, guacamole and hot sauce. YUMS! Another must try is the steak quesadilla - you will not be disappointed. Avocados galore in there and make sure u squeeze lime into each bite.A+ for being open late on weekends until like 4am on Saturdays. If you have late night munchies, this is the place for you.YAH, for burnt STEAK because that&#39;s why I keep coming back ^_^

This place looks kinda run down from the outside, So I go there... since my friend said this place is good. I took his word for it. When you order I guess pretty much anything, you get a side of chips. Water comes straight from the tap, literally. So I order a Shrimp Burrito... it was good. The shrimp they used were fresh and hella big. :)Was not disappointed at all, will try other things next time I am in the area.

This place is kind of hidden. But it&#39;s definitely authentic. A local of the area suggested we come here. I ordered a burrito with guacamole, broiled chicken, onions, and rice. Wow...definitely plane. Why do people even bother with Mexican food if there&#39;s no pico de gallo?? It&#39;s useless. I tried to submerge the plain burrito in their delicious green sauce, but it did nothing. Don&#39;t get the burritos. Their tacos and steak quesadilla looked more promising. The quesadilla was HUGE and dripping with cheese. The tacos are more colourful and stuffed.

My friend lives directly across the street so when I think I&#39;m going to go see Nalini, I&#39;m actually thinking Super Burrito day!! MMM...I remember the days when the super burritos were less than $4 today they are about $6-7 damn inflations! The meat is so good here, the burritos are HUGE! and the salsas are fresh. I HEART MY BURRITO that&#39;s why I&#39;m fat. I will miss you during my diet, as soon as my pants are loose again I will come see you. I&#39;ve also had their taco salad, yum!

Sad how their food is quite delicious while their customer service is quite horrendous.I ordered three burritos while the cashier only gave me two bags. I tried explaining to him that the meal is for three people and should come with three bags of chips. Then this guy had the balls to tell me &#34;only one bag of chip per person and I already gave you two. One more bag will be 60 cents&#34; Did this asshole not understand what I just said? Did he want my whole family to come buy their meal separately?The attitude was horrible and I was just putting money in his pocket to teach him some customer service. If I ever eat here again my name is not Dorian!

I was seriously not a big fan of burritos and tacos till I tried El Farolito&#39;s. My boyfriend tried to persuade me into liking Mexican food so he would always take me here for lunch/dinner since he lives a couple of blocks away. I fell in love with their super nachos and carne asada super burrito. Even talking about it makes me want one now. I love how they&#39;re not stingy with their chips like other taquerias. Every time I&#39;m in my hometown and I&#39;m craving for a burrito, I think about El Farolitos and makes me miss coming here every week. Also another pro about this taqueria is that they&#39;re open late.

Its about damn time I wrote a review for this place. Where to begin about El Farolito. Maybe the fact that they have multiple locations and all of them are damn good?Well, this location is particular is down the street from my apartment so I frequent this place way too often then I need to. Since I take pride in calling myself a burrito connoisseur, I&#39;ve had my fair share of burritos.Man whatever this place is doing, they are doing it damn right. But I think the highlight for me would be there salsa. Now, when you think salsa.. its usually the red one. But oh does this place do the green one some justice! They use avocado chunks in it! WTF.. You heard me right...You know this place is doing something right when there is like 20 other taquerias in the vicinity and they STILL get a large crowd.

Carnitas Super Burrito, oh how I love theeeee. The carnitas was chopped up and spread evenly throughout the burrito, so every bite is like heaven. I really like the carnitas tacos too! Maybe I just really like carnitas.. In any case, it&#39;s delicious here!It&#39;s hard to get someone on the phone to take your order for pick-up but be patient! Parking is a PAIN so I recommend parking at the first spot you see or bringing someone else so they can go in and get it.

While there are haters out here, who rightly point out that SF pales in comparison to basically everywhere else in CA that is farther south for overall quality of mexican food, El Farolito delivers in the city. Super Quesadilla is simply unrivaled. Their burrito&#39;s have the most meat bar none.I will say that I rate Taqueria Can-Cun&#39;s burritos ever so slightly higher, because of better salsa in the burrito...but Farrolito smashes them on volume of meat. So it&#39;s a tradeoff really. Add in that at Farolito there are so many tasty options I usually just come here!Keep holding it down fellas!

I honestly didn&#39;t like the food here. I&#39;ve been to a couple taquerias around SF and this is the worst one. I order a shrimp quesadilla that didn&#39;t have any taste at all. My friend got the quesadilla de al pastor. The meat was hard and instead of having that pastor taste, it tasted like a chile or chorizo seasoning taste. Go to taqueria Guadalajara across the street which is way better, you&#39;ll thank me for this one. Trust me on this, I&#39;m a Mexicana chick who loves to grub on her Mexican food.

Add a few pueblos this area of Mission St and it would be like you&#39;re in Mexico because there&#39;s 20 Mex restaurants per block. El Faro here definitely delivers with great food starting with the salsa bar, the tomatillo salsa is one of the best around.The al pastor burrito was tasty and juicy. They forgot to put guacamole in my burrito which i didnt realize until 3/4 through eating but I got some on the side and it was worth it. The guy tries to tell me its hidden between the tomatoes, that dude must be colorblind since there was no a speck of green. Overall, good food and bad liars.

The best Taqueria in the Bay. All the locations are great. The chips are always fresh, the salsa verde is my favorite salsa in existence. Back when I used to eat meat I remember the meat tasting amazing. I now get pretty much the same thing. Veggie nachos, not refried beans, however black and pinto. Not Guacamole, Avocado instead. Add the cilantro and onion, add tomatio sauce, and there you have it. The guys who work at this particular location are really nice guys and have no problem making this altered meal for me.

El Farolito never cease to disappoint me.I generally order their super burritos with carne asada meat, super nachos and super quesadillas. Each are huge portions that&#39;s worth my money. Just add a tad bit of Tapatio sauce and I&#39;m good to go.I love this Mexican joint because of its location, easy street parking, debit friendly and the FREE chips and (3) kinds of salsa that comes with your order is fantabulous.I gotta say, their food hits the spot whenever I&#39;m craving be if it is lunch, dinner or late night munchies.oh and also, the service and staff are great. They have accommodated my needs a few times when I wanted the channel to be switched to a basketball or football game.

&#34;When I have the munchies and want burrito or quesadilla washed down with some horchata, and I know the only other things open at 1am are Jack in the Crack, Safeway or 7-11, El Farolito is my place!Living in LA for a few years, I would crave one of their super quesadillas. Their combination of cheese, steak and grease leaves me wanting more. And their portions are huge!

I don&#39;t get the big deal about this place.Well, to be fair, there was only one thing I didn&#39;t like, and that was how ridiculously salty the meat was. The price was great, the rest of the burrito was great, the portions were great, but the meat was so salty to the point of almost being inedible.I&#39;m wondering if this gets such high reviews because people come here so often when drunk and saltiness isn&#39;t an issue when you&#39;ve had a lot to drink.

1. CROWDED at 3AM on a saturday night in the middle of excelsior? they&#39;re doing something right.2. lengua super burrito. 5 star quality. rice was cooked perfectly, beans weren&#39;t smothered in lard, lettuce was fresh. tortilla was crisp. green habanero sauce was poppppin, so was the regular salsa.3. the strawberry fresca honestly gets 10/5 stars by itself, no joke.4. clean enough place to grub at, crowd wasn&#39;t starting trouble.. enough tables to go around. TV was on some old show with sofia vergara (modern family chica) hosting. she&#39;s 15/5 stars.. again, no joke.5. i left DISGUSTINGLY full.. the burrito was HUGE. and i&#39;m a big boy with a healthy appetite, it takes a lot to fill this stomach.6. yes the quality and taste out do burrito spots in san jose, however the price does not. $8 FOR A BURRITO?! you realize that for $2 LESS, i can get a drink, cinnamon twists, a 5-layer burrito, beef burrito, AND crunchwrap supreme from taco bells $5-box combo meal!?BURRITO = CRACCCCKEN. price = no bueno

This place definitely hits the spot when you&#39;re really hungry. The food tastes great and the portions could be more consistent but it&#39;s REALLY good.I always order the super nachos and they are to die-for. The order always comes with a bag of chips and salsa which are always great to have on the side or with the nachos.They open late night so that&#39;s a plus for people that are driving around looking for a late night snack. They also have a breakfast menu so I think they open early as well.

I&#39;ve only been here for one item - the super nachos. I only have one thing to say about that ... walk across the street and get your nachos at guadalajara. Their nachos are 10x better. But with that being said, the nachos here are better than most other places&#39;. Its a shame they set up shop so close to guadalajara.*sidenote yay 50 reviews!

Ahh, this place reminds me of off campus lunch in HS. It was either here, hawaiian drive in or safeway. Often it was HERE.The Super Burrito with carne asada (back when i ate the flesh of animals). Man was that shit awesome. I&#39;ve tried the taqueria across the street and it was a-OK but idk, there was a certain flair El Farolito has.I don&#39;t come here anymore because I&#39;m never in the area anymore, and because honestly if I&#39;m going to go out of my way for mexican food the only place I&#39;m going is Pancho Villa. But if you are in the area and craving Mexican, don&#39;t go across the street, go to El Farolito!

I was lost as hell looking for food one day, walked past Irving Cafe and Deli and tripped over a SUPER QUESADILLA!! Sort of...I dont think this place is as awesome as the one on 24th and Mission, hence the 1 star deduction. Same menu, same portions, just made slightly different.Everytime I come here, its always super quesadilla. Don&#39;t bother with the damn rice and beans, just get hella meat.

The portion here is huge! :) Loving the Super Quesadilla with Carne Asada. Also, if you go, you have to try the Super Burrito and the Tacos. Very tasteful and it&#39;ll definitely keep you full for the rest of the day! Chips are complimentary with order and the salsa are bomb ass!! :D Salsa is self-served so get as much as you want.

Freakin&#39; huge super burrito! Carne asada was a little over cooked so a lil&#39; chewy. The beans were perfectly seasoned and I love that they put cheese in it! Comes with real chips (not greasy at all) and as much salsa as you like and for about $7 got lunch and leftover burrito for dinner. It&#39;s no King Taco (I&#39;m a SoCal girl) but it will do when I want to be reminded of home.

I LOVE THIS PLACE!The burritos are huge, the price is cheap, and it&#39;s open after midnight! I actually saved their phone number into my phone so that my food would be ready when I get there, avoiding the usual long line! I know, I know...lazy and impatient but whatever!The staff is pretty funny too so that&#39;s an extra plus....I only gave them 4 stars because well...the place is a little dirty and the parking is ridiculous. But other than that, its yummy...My advice...a bottle of La Victoria&#39;s Orange sauce + El Farolito Super Burrito/ Super Quesadilla=A MATCH MADE IN HEAVEN.

I have finally wandered away from my usual &#39;super nachos&#39;. I didn&#39;t think this feat was possible, but weirder things have happened. Granted, my first choice upon entering had BEEN the &#39;super nachos&#39; - only to switch that over to &#39;regular nachos&#39; and then finally, upon my boyfriend&#39;s prodding because he went and said, &#34;Do you want the regular?&#34; Because apparently it&#39;s all I ever order at any Mexican restaurant or taqueria.After reluctantly eyeballing the menu for a good two minutes, I hesitated - but placed my order for the Quesadilla Suiza with steak. I expected maybe a floppy little thin piece - kind of like the kind you see from Taco Bell. I wasn&#39;t holding my breath too much, but when we got home and we sat down to eat in front of the TV. I unwrapped a lovely little surprise.Two thick, huge pieces. Cooked just right with a savory, delicious flavor that melted in my mouth with each chew. Sure, it was a little greasy but that sort of thing really doesn&#39;t go through your mind nor bother you when you&#39;re enjoying the hell out of your meal. Each bite is like the foreplay, each chew is the deed, and the swallow -- well, you know.I think I&#39;ve found my new regular.

I recalled my first or second experience here was with the quesadia. It was super good, so I had to make it a SUPER tonight. I aimed for the carne asada AGAIN (not remembering my last review about preferring the carnitas better), and it was good, but not THE BEST. However, I do love how everything thats in it. The melted cheese is MMm mMmm good. I also ordered the carne asada super taco, and it was a bit small for $3 versus the super quesedia/super burrito for 6.50. However, I saw many, many slices of fresh avocado on here and it was smothered in sour cream (more so than the quesedia for its portion). Both were good, but I think the melted cheese on the quesedia wins buy an inch.The workers were neither friendly or rude today. It could be better. I walked in at around 10:30pm with about 4 people ahead of me. Less than 5 minutes later, there were like more than 10 people behind me? Crazy.P.S. After eating the taco and about half the quesedia, my stomache is still bulging like an hour and a half later. Alright. I admit. Before going to El Farolito, this fatty had dinner already. I just had a SLIGHT craving for avocado, sour cream, and still went for it anyway. I think after this, I&#39;ll be good for a while. That was just way too much to digest.

I went here a couple days ago during early morning hours and ordred a Chicken Quesadilla Suiza. It was oh so good yet oh so bad and greasy. So if you find yourself in the area, hungry during late night or early morning, and feel like mexican food, this is a pretty good choice to go to.

over-rated and burritos are tiny.place was just okay. i like the burrito place on mission-geneva better. It is called Taqueria La Iguana Azul. the grilled chicked is way better than EL Farolito.i think this place is okay because Iguana Azul set the bar so high.if you&#39;re coming from the land of no burritos you&#39;ll probably be somewhat impressed...of the mission style assembly line

I usually go to their neighbor across the street, Guadalajara, but I decided to give this place a try. Even though I still love Guadalajara across the street, this place is still really good. Once I got in I got the sense that this place knew how to make a good burrito. And boy was I right.After my first bite in my super burrito with lengua I knew it was good. Bite after bite, next thing I knew I was food. This place know how to make a burrito and it has a lot of seatings to serve burrito lovers like me out there.Give the place a try. Price isn&#39;t too bad either.

And I love the fact that they put a good helping of avocados and sour cream.No matter what I order here I always find myself a very satisfied customer.

FOR EACH AND EVERY BITE.GOOD THING IS, IF YOU RUN OUT OF SALSA, YOU CAN JUST GET THE HELL UP AND GET AS MUCH AS YOU WANT.USUALLY I CAN ONLY FINISH 1/2 (these things are huge), SO I BOX UP THE OTHER 1/2 AND RE-UP ON ALL MY FAVORITE CONDIMENTS AND EAT IT FOR BREAKFAST THE NEXT MORNING.eating this sort of meal motivates me to go to the gym the next day b/c eating it makes me feel like a fat tub of lard b/c it&#39;s so damn good it has to be bad for you.

The absolute BEST place for quick (and I mean quick) and cheap Mexican food. Hefty portions with a great taste. You gotta love their salsas too.

I&#39;ve been to my share of taquerias and this is by far the best. Best service, best quality of food, BEST horchata, fastest, open late, dirt cheap.After a night out on the town my woman and I will stop in here to share a plate of nachos or a quesadilla and a horchata. complete meal for both of us for under $8. beat that.

Man... sometimes its good and sometimes its great! Their food is usually on point, as I can only remember one time out of all the years that I&#39;ve been here that their meat was dry. Whether its a carne asada super burrito (w/ extra jalapenos), a shrimp super quesodilla suiza, or some al pastor tacos, this place is reliable for some tasty mexican food (especially after a RIDICULOUS hangover).Their salsas is what I crave for the most though, as I cop at least 6 greens and 6 freshly diced every time I come through. And their strawberry fresca tastes like strawberry juice, where as other places make it taste like strawberry candy. If you&#39;re drunk and coming out of a club, this is a must on the way home

Conveniently a few blocks away from my house. Not as crowded as the 24th street location, which is where I used to go when I was still living in that area.

THE spot for after club grub. Not because the food is anything special (Many people disagree on that point), but because it&#39;s open late. Seating can be tricky so someone from your group needs to stake their claim while the rest of you are in line. Regardless of the food, part of the fun in being here is the variety of people. You&#39;ll see neighborhood locals, clubbers, hipsters, crossdressers, and more crackheads than you can shake a pipe at. And because the seating is so close you may make a new friend or two. I met Harry Potter here. It was most magical.Hogwarts here I come!

The burritos are delicious! The pollo and carne is always well seasoned and cooked to juicy perfection! The super shrimp burrito is bomb. If you dont know you better ask.. YELP! Sorry i think its the coffee i drank this morning.. Anyway. The quesadillas are more than enough! Two large extra cheeseeeeyy gooey flour tortillas with sour cream &amp; avocado.

I love how they&#39;re open late, but beware, this is one of the places everybody and their mamas goes to after a club, so try not to go late night on the weekend.

too good for words to describe how delectable the food was, but i&#39;ll try.i came here with two friends, one who was familiar with the place and the other was like me, new but ready for our taste buds to savour what was to come.my friend and i shared a huuuuge wet burrito with chorizo (mexican sausage) and my other friend got his usual carne asada burrito.UM, CAN YOU SAY HEAVEN?-the wet burrito just melted in my mouth and i devoured that thing (my half, at least). my friend agreed that it was pretty awesome.-nachos come with unlimited salsa. a few salsas to choose from too!-decent price for the gigantic size of a wet burrito.-friendly cooks and workers. they really work for the customer&#39;s satisfaction!YEAH--it was heaven.

Super burrito. Good. Really cheap considering its a good amount of food and very good quality. And it comes with chips + salsa to munch on while you wait for the super burrito.

My dear ol&#39; dad has been bringing home burritos from this place every so often for the past few months, and I never knew where they came from until now. Turns out that I&#39;d been here with some friends a while back. I remember having their carne asada quesadilla, and it was HUGE! I was more than happy to take home the leftovers and have them for lunch the next day. The burritos are excellent. My dad orders them sans the beans, ya know, just to keep it classy and not gassy. Kidding! With or without them, they&#39;re awesome. No need to add anything to this stuff while eating them because they&#39;re not dry. That alone deserves the extra star. I only ate half of the one I got today, so I&#39;m thinking about attacking the other half right about.....now! El Farlito&#39;s Phe*nomnomnom*enal! =)

I just moved to SF from Berkeley a few months ago and this spot has become, hands-down, my favorite burrito place in the Bay Area. El Faro&#39;s has basically ruined it for me in regards to my former favorite burrito place in Berkeley.Recommended: Super burrito and super quesadilla.Things I considered just &#34;okay&#34;: Super nachos, horchata (too grainy), and the aguas frescas (too sweet)

This is where I go for burritos in SF...they dont cost a arm and a leg and they are delicious. Super Burrito de carne asada is bomb! also try they super nachos and tortas. But if you are not that hungry a couple of tacos with suffice. Try this place if you have a chance I&#39;m telling you you will walk out of there with a smile and food coma!

For San Francisco I think this is close to the best the bay has to offer. The chips and salsa are always fresh, grilled chicken tacos are a light alternative to supreme nachos, which I highly recommend, and they have big vats of bubbling meat going all day long. Expect to wait in a short line and try the carnitas as well.

El Farolito one of the best Taquieras in the city, I like this Farolito better than the one one Mission and 24th, not as crowded with people and more closer to home.Like their Tacos al pastor and carnitas, as well as de cabeza, but unfortunately they don&#39;t serve Tacos de Seso anymore, which the other Farolito still does, but like I said it&#39;s too crowded. Their Pollo Asado Super Burrito is pretty good as well.Y si hablas Espanol toda las vezes te llaman &#34;Primo&#34; pero como yo creci en el Sur de California, La Raza de alla los llamamos entre uno a otro &#34;Compa&#34; en vez de &#34;Primo&#34;

This is the place I always go to when I have a late night craving for Mexican food. I&#39;m not sure when they close, but I&#39;ve been here at 2 a.m. and this place is still serving customers.There&#39;s a ton of other taquerias in this area, I&#39;ve tried a few and this one is the best, although it &#39;s not my all time favorite (that would be La Victoria in San Jose). I like how this place gives you free chips and salsa, you never know which places will do that.When I&#39;m really hungry I get the super wet burrito and carnitas is always the meat of my choice when it comes to mexican. It&#39;s so good with the enchilada sauce all over it with tomatoes, sour cream, and guacamole mmm.... The quesadillas are pretty good too (although I prefer the ones at La Victoria, best quesadillas ever!), they&#39;re big and so cheesy and they don&#39;t skimp on the meat.This (and La Victoria) is the place I benchmark other taquerias against. I mean it&#39;s so good here I&#39;m willing to drive 20 minutes from home to get a burrito and suffer another 20 minutes of mouth watering anticipation on the way back!

Whenever I&#39;m in the mood for a good burrito but am to lazy to go further into the mission i hit up this place or when I&#39;m heading home late night from a club/bar i also hit this place up.I can always count on my food to taste as good as it did on my previous visits here. My faves are the super burritos and the super nachos. The meat is always juicy and flavorful. The guy preparing the food is always generous with all the ingredients.Only reason why i took one star off is because the place seems like it needs some better cleaning and some times i do wake up with a tummy ache but i think that from mixing large amounts of alcohol and late night Mexican food.

This is my favorite taqueria, EVER! I go here at least once a week after school to chow down. The staff is so friendly, I always go there and attempt to order in Spanish, and the staff is so friendly even though it&#39;s really bad and don&#39;t roll their eyes at my awful accent, and actually talk back, and also so that I can understand.I would definately recomend the quesadilla&#39;s. Meat, cheese, sour cream and avacado. Yum! Thats all you need.

Their burritos and quesadillas are gi-normous. Although i&#39;m not a very flour tortilla kinda person. I usually go for the tacos or the echilladas. yummy. Their carne asada is very good and their grilled chicken is kinda sweet but also very good. You can also get your bootleg DvD&#39;s from here. There&#39;s a lady that kinda opens her bag and a million dvd&#39;s come out.Good to know that it&#39;s open late night, i&#39;ll have to stop by there again sometime.

Across the street from my favorite, Taqueria Guadalajara, this place is right up there in terms of yumminess.Although I prefer Guadalajara myself, some of my friends prefer this place. I have no problem with that. They do serve a pretty solid chicken burrito.Their super nachos are really good. It comes packed with your choice of meat, guacamole, salsa, beans, cheese, sour cream (though I usually leave this out...not really a sour cream fan), all over chips. Huge portion size, definitely sharable between friends.And they have horchata :)

You want REAL Mexican food...then this is the place to come. Their super burritos, quesadillas and nachos are as good as they get. Your get a free bag of chips with your orders and you get your own salsa from the salsa bar. Their staff is also very friendly. I am a very picky eater and they are very patient with taking the things i don&#39;t want out of my burrito. The prices are pretty cheap for good quality Mexican food. If you want a taste of Mexico this is the place to come, not Rubios, Green Salsa or Chevy&#39;s. They are also open till 1am...which is pretty good if your craving Mexican food late at night.

Have locked down two visits so far in the past week, and I must say its a hot tub in tasty town! Meaning its delicious. At least the quesidilla suiza with carne asada is. There was a bit of gristle in a couple of the carne pieces that I had to spit out, but no one&#39;s perfect. And I have yet to experience the wrath of any repercussions for having eaten there. But my stomach is pretty in tune with greasy food so I might just be lucky. Very recommended though.

So this may not the be the cleanest place I&#39;ve been to... but the 4 stars are strictly for the one menu item: the delectable steak suiza. The place itself is not the most appealing, but this suiza is the diamond in the rough. There are the usual taqueria items available and while they may be satisfying, the suiza can stand all by itself. I don&#39;t expect anyone to go out their way, but if you&#39;re in the neighborhood - have a suiza, and have a good day. =)

I&#39;m surprised this place is rated as high as it is. I thought it was mediocre at best. Maybe I just caught them on an off night. The enchiladas in particular were gross and overpriced, and smothered in bland tomoato sauce. The pollo asado burrito was not bad but not especially good either. In any case, I would definitely recommend walking across the street to Taqueria Guadalajara instead of eating here.

El Farolito (EF) is a staple in the Mission. For me, it is the standard I judge other burritos by. The place has a high quality to price ratio. The meats are always succulent and they have the 2nd best salsa in town. [I think Papalote is the best].It is a place where if you have visitors in town, you can take them for a great, quick meal and give them an idea of what the Mission is like.Go Farolito!

El Farolito is one of the best taquerias I&#39;ve been to. I used to always go to the one on 24th and Mission, however since I moved to Daly City this one is much more convenient to drive to. I usually get the super carne asada burrito since it is huge and has the juiciest steak I&#39;ve ever had in a burrito. The only reason I am not giving this place 5 stars is because the last few times I&#39;ve been there they&#39;ve been stingy with the avocado.

mmmmmm. i want some right now..and i just had it yesterday. I can not stop going to this place!Every Sunday after church, my friends and I stand around asking where we should go eat lunch--as if it&#39;s not obvious we&#39;re going to choose El Farolito. And for some reason, even though i go everyyy Sunday, I still get super excited. Most times though, once a week isn&#39;t enough.El Farolito has the tastiestttt foods. I use to always order the super burritos, but now order super tacos instead because i don&#39;t really like rice and beans, but i like sour cream and guacamole...so the tacos are perfect. Also, they&#39;re much small than the burritos so I don&#39;t end up getting stuffed, but I still end up full.I always get carne asada, but my boyfriend always gets tripas. The tripas are super fatty, so instead i eat my carne asada taco while taking bites off of my boyfriend&#39;s tripas super burrito. (it works! i dont get guilty eating his!)Their super shrimp taco is good too! they give a lot of shrimp! yea, it&#39;s more expensive, but they actually give a lot! for the tacos, they give 6! and for the burritos, they give 12! and they&#39;re BIG!Their agua frescas are very yummy too!salsa is super spicy--just the way i like it,They&#39;re opened until 2-3am!!forget about going tomorrow, I&#39;m going right now.

my favorite burrito spot in the city. i&#39;ve been to the 24st &amp; mission location. i like this spot better. open late night, and its much cleaner and not as cramped. their carnitas burrito rocks!

El Farolito has the HUGEST burrito at the most reasonable price I have ever seen in my whole life. Plus, it comes with free chips and as much salsa as your heart desires. I&#39;ve been going here for years and the prices haven&#39;t changed by THAT much. The bathroom is definitely better used somewhere else. Hey, it&#39;s not a fine dining establishment. But if you&#39;re in the Mission late night looking for a delicious super cheap super burrito to share with a friend or two - look no further. This place is it.

i guess my experience at this place doesn&#39;t parallel most peoples, seeing as el farolito has a very high average rating. i&#39;ve had only the vegetarian burritos here a few times. they&#39;re cold and pretty tasteless. for a great vegetarian burrito go to guadalajara across the street. i would, but let&#39;s just say i had an experience in there which makes me extremely embarassed to go back and be seen. hm, maybe when i graduate from college i&#39;ll look different enough to go back.

great place for a quick super suiza since its only down the block =). its open pretty late so if youre just gettin out of a party drunk as a skunk(?) this place is probably open. just dont expect to use their bathroom and find a new roll of TP.
