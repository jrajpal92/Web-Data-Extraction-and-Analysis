Came here to have a few beers before heading to the comedy club next door.$2.50 draft beers are a awesome price. They serve food as well but just had drinks here.Seating is low key and staff is alright.

Stopped in here for lunch as I had seen on Yelp they do soup and that&#39;s what I was in the mood for! $4.50 for a cup as I thought a bowl would be too much for me, however I think they gave me a bowl anyway! Tomato ravioli with delicious bread and iced water on tap.The menu looks great and the decor was cool. Not loads of places to sit - many people came in and left because there were no free seats!Will definitely return here

Came here with my family after we concluded our walking tour of the famous Lombard Street. This place fulfilled all of our picky food desires! I got the Maui Smoothie and a Hummus sandwich, both were exceptional. San Francisco has some delicious eateries, and the 901 Columbus Cafe fits the bill. The service was impressively fast and we were all very happy.

I always seem to find myself stopping here while walking around North Beach on a nice day. I was initially enticed by the $2.50 draft beer sign and outdoor seating. This little cafe has a nice selection of wraps, salads, sandwiches, coffee and pastries. I&#39;ve tried the falafel wrap, nice and spicy and quite filling with a small side salad. The $2.50 beers offered are all from Speakeasy Ales so you&#39;re not just getting some cheap PBR. Also, I think glasses of wine are around $3. Nothing fancy here just a great affordable place in the area to grab a bite and enjoy the outside.

Small and nice coffee shop in one of the most touristy parts of SF. They have a variety of breakfast items, coffees and smoothies. I went with the salmon bagel and it was great, my bf had the breakfast burrito and said it was okay. The only downside is that the service is a bit slow and they only take cash.

OMG thank you 901 Columbus Cafe for saving my tummy from what seemed like eternal starvation! Originally, we&#39;d decided on some sourdough at Boudin, but when we were told we&#39;d have to wait 45 minutes, we thought &#34;nevermind!&#34;So off we go in search of another place. Walking... more walking ... baby screaming ... hurry up and find a place ... oh look that place says $2 drafts ... let me check with Yelp first ... Yelp says OK! ... Let&#39;s go!We walk up to the counter and place our order. The guy at the counter recommended the wiseguy panini, so I went ahead and tried that. The panini was ABSOLUTELY delicious. I loved the large slices of mozzarella! Soooo good! My husband had the pastrami and wasn&#39;t too happy with it. He kept complaining about a weird taste, then he took out the lettuce and said that it was the culprit. Needless to say, I felt kinda bad that his meal wasn&#39;t as great as mine.And YEP, $2 drafts. Not sure if this is an every day thing, but it was there when we went and we took full advantage.The one thing I didn&#39;t appreciate quite as much as that delicious mozzarella, was the not-so-friendly guy behind the counter. Seemed annoyed that we were there. Is this a trend in SF?? I&#39;m starting to think so!Anywho, food was good enough. I&#39;d go back for another panini, or two!

This place has the neighborhood&#39;s best ... ... ...ATM. And the $1.50 rack of &#34;fun size&#34; chips pretty much sums up this tacky tear-me-down.In lieu of raising even a single finger to improve upon the kennelesque atmosphere or to change the meager-portioned, repulsive, overpriced dishes, this Sysco cafe instead strategically carrots in the masses with a gargantuan tarp proclaiming &#34;$2 draft specials here&#34;. The shoddy cafe has made the neighborhood into their permanent Mississippi beer festival.I&#39;ve never smoked crack, but if I had, I know it&#39;d taste just like their iced coffee.Everything I&#39;ve had here that involved the kitchen has been an equal upset to my digestive tract as it has been my wallet. I still can&#39;t figure out why even the iced coffee tastes stale, burnt, and old. If I had to point my divining rod at something, I&#39;d reason that it&#39;s because... it&#39;s stale, burnt, and old. Well, hey, consistency is key. It matches the ambiance.To me, this is the definition of the slippery-grasped total loss and relinquishment of pride. Absolutely, to the detriment of humanity, a &#34;what&#39;s the bottom line?&#34; cash cow mob business. Just slightly too tragic and not quite effortless enough to be a drug front, but it wouldn&#39;t take much work. So if you&#39;re in the market to market to cartels, you might want to make an offer.

YUMMERS!!Went here on a Saturday afternoon after visiting Lombard Street.There was no line when we got there which we lucked out on because as soon as we sat down to order, a crapload of people entered &amp; formed a decent line.Love the decor, feels so &#39;lax &amp; chill.They had the Warriors game playing &amp; a good amount of seating.You order at the front &amp; pay (CASH ONLY), they hand you a number &amp; you can either sit inside or outside. They bring the food to you.I ordered the Sinatra Warp (Vegetarian friendly!) OMG sooooooo yummers!!! A wrap with feta, olives, hummus, and avocados.FYI, lots of tourist since Lombard street is right there.

Some people see this as a great secret gem in the area but each time I have gone to this place I have been highly disappointed. The first time I went I ordered a wrap at the register and when I got the wrap it had the only two items I asked not to be on there. It made it inedible. I am not the type of person to return things so I left unsatisfied.The second time was the same deal. The register person couldn&#39;t understand what I was ordering and then brought me the wrong item again. I can&#39;t get over this happening twice and I will not be returning to this establishment.It is incredibly expensive for what they offer including lackluster salads and wraps. It is also cash only which it is not worth doing when you could go to many other better cafes in the area. Do yourself a favor and walk up the street to Cafe Sapore for lunch and Roccos for drinks. There are few places I actually refuse to go to and this is one of them.

Stopped in to do some work and just kinda hang out for a bit and really enjoyed this place. It&#39;s in a great location - not a far walk from fisherman&#39;s wharf or chinatown. I had a Chai Tea, which really wasn&#39;t all that great. But it looks more like a bar than a coffee/team place so I really wasn&#39;t surprised.

I think the beers available were Prohibition Ale, Big Daddy IPA and Baby Daddy IPA.The service was good. The food was great with a large selection.A relaxed vibe, with chilled out people and some decent tunes makes for a great experience in this cafe. I wish I could have spent more time here!

One of large handful of low key neighborhood places that are pretty low key where you can relax for a beer ($2 drafts 3-6), partake a respectable menu ranging from soup to sandwiches to breakfast. ..or slip into a great coffee and plant your self in a leather chair and chill.Convenient locale on the way to/from the Wharf and the Financial District.I always like their cappuccinos.

Tourist hotspot alert! I walked in on quite a busy day (the St. Patty&#39;s Parade), but my order was quickly taken, and I had my meal in no time. If you manage to drop in during a clear sunny day, find a seat right in front of the entry way. There is a beautiful view of Coit Tower, which makes the city feel like home.As far as the food goes, I had the &#34;Sinatra&#34; wrap. It&#39;s a healthy take with feta, olives, hummus, and avocados. The tortilla it was wrapped in was very soft and fresh. Although, I wish they had whole grain options (I have to admit I didn&#39;t ask, so not sure if they do or don&#39;t). It also seemed like they had a full dinner menu? and beers on tap.

Uhm, $2 beers during happy hour, which lasts 5 hours on weekdays? Yes, I will have that, and a little more, please. Decent sandwiches (but lackluster salads) for under $10 (I am partial to the salamocado. I wish it had bacon, but it has salami, fresh basil, lettuce, and cheese. That&#39;s already a pretty good combination. There&#39;s one couch, and it&#39;s perched in front of the small flat screen, so get there and snag a seat early. They show Giants game and other local sports teams, but the majority of people who I see frequent this place are just ordinary folks who want to work or just hang out and enjoy the weather. They even have a printer that prints pages for .75 if you&#39;re on a deadline of sorts. Cash only, though, so make sure you hit the ATM, but $2 beers! Come on. That&#39;s a win.

Terrible service and terrible pastries. Went here on a Saturday morning to grab a coffee and croissants. The guy behind the counter was incredibly rude... Seemed like he was spaced out or high or something. Forgot half of our order... Made a soy latte instead of chai. When I asked about the mix up him he just shoved it at me and told me to take it. I&#39;ve never had such terrible service. And then the croissants we ordered were 3 days stale and clearly from Costco. Would recommend to the owner to better hire his staff... The counter clearly did not belong working in a cafe or in a cafe at all.

Locals and tourists alike are drawn to this corner cafe on the cusp of North Beach and Fisherman&#39;s Wharf for the ambiance, good prices ($2 draft beers) and decent food. Characters are abound, so grab a drink, snack and enjoy the scene as it unfolds. Menu is similar to other cafes in the city, sandwiches, soup, crepes, deserts, all for under ten bucks.

Solid 3 stars.Cozy little cafe in a great spot, good atmosphere. Unpretentious. The menu looked tasty at first but my iced chai latte was sickly sweet and I&#39;m pretty sure they made a mistake on my Corleone panini (it&#39;s supposed to come with pesto, but it had a marinara sauce on it instead?). It was edible but I probably wouldn&#39;t come back for it. Altogether a 4 for atmosphere and 2 for food, so a solid 3.

Normally I love the coffee here and would give it 5 stars but I had the &#39;Santa Cruze&#39; (bagel and smoked salmon) but the cheese they used was terrible and bland. I asked the man at the register about the cheese and he just stared back at me. Zero customer service even when I went back to buy a beer. This may have just been the Friday night at 7pm atmosphere but I just wasn&#39;t impressed.

Since we are only passing through San Francisco this time around I had to find a good cafe, NOT Starbucks, that was nearby the hotel. This place did not disappoint. Everything is made with care. The espresso was just what I needed and the wraps and granola with yogurt was an added bonus. Get a wrap! They were so good that we ordered more for the road. The employees are super friendly and entertaining. I wish had more time in San Francisco.

It&#39;s really hot in here (maybe because it was pretty warm outside), but the smoothie I had was good (strawberry banana). Cheaper version of the Starbucks kind. They also serve beer, which is cool. A huge menu meets your eye on the wall behind the cashier, so it seems there&#39;s plenty of dining options to choose from. If I&#39;m ever back in the North Beach area, and needed a beverage, I&#39;d definitely stop by again.

I don&#39;t like to leave bad reviews, especially if I&#39;ve only been somewhere once but I haven&#39;t had crappy customer service like this in a while - so please excuse the rant. I just stopped by to grab lunch and realized Columbus Cafe only accepts cash. I had some cash on me but not enough for what we ordered + tip, so I asked the cashier if he could just take off one of the items. he said he couldn&#39;t b/c he had already rung it in and told us to pull more cash out of the ATM machines instead.I might have been fine with this if the cashier was at least friendly about it, but he said sarcastically to look at the clearly marked cash only sign scrawled on the cash register. Sorry, I was busy looking at your menu dude, but if service is normally like this I never plan to come back here.

As we were reading the menu, thinking about the prices, because once again, It is JUST CASH, the guy is staring at us like we need to hurry up. Me and my friends frantically ordered some salads.We were in a rush to get back to our classes, and we kindly asked the cashier if he could be a little fast with our food because of this. He was rude and did not seem like he cared. Our food finally came. The salads were large in size, and nothing special. The Iced Chai is delicious, I have to give them that.Overpriced, and touristy.

I couldn&#39;t get enough of this cafe when I was staying down the street in North Beach last weekend in San Francisco.They have great breakfast sandwiches that range from $4-$6, which was my go-to every morning. I recommend getting it on a bagel (they have croissants too... tough choice)! Grab a cup a coffee with your breakfast too because it&#39;s delicious.I went three times over the course of 4 days. Enough said.Don&#39;t forget that it is CASH ONLY. They do have an ATM, but I recommend getting money from you home bank before to avoid the charge.Now I want a breakfast sandwich...

Most of the cafes in north beach are over-priced and super touristy. 901 is pretty much the exception to this. I think it really helps that it&#39;s about halfway between north beach and fisherman&#39;s wharf, kind of a tourist no-man&#39;s land.I usually drink tea or beer when I&#39;m here, but I&#39;ve heard the coffee is pretty good. The vibe&#39;s super calm and you can just chill here for hours. Free wifi and you can print too (not sure how much that costs)Next time I go, I really want to check out some of the food. Last time I was there, I noticed a few vegan/vegetarian options that seemed appetizing.Only downside is that it is indeed in North Beach, which means you kind of have to go out of your way to get here. But hey, if you&#39;re going to see a show at Bimbos, why not stop here beforehand?

Chill little cafe - think Central Perk from Friends. This place isn&#39;t just coffee, cake and a paper. Whether you&#39;re looking to browse the web/kick your boyfriend&#39;s butt at checkers and sip a cup of coffee....OR have lunch and a beer or few (at $2 a pint during happy hour, you can&#39;t beat it!), I think this is a cool spot for anyone. Not too loud, either, and I like the music they usually have playing. They also have a couple seating areas outside, which is awesome for people watching whilst sipping your $2 beer, haha. One of those places that I would frequent if I lived in the area. Minus 1 star for the smelly, although interestingly decorated, bathroom.**White Lightning beer was good, tiramisu was eh....the lemon bar was delicious!!!

Damn, I should have come here for my 901st review!...Well, I&#39;m glad the owner didn&#39;t come up with some misconceived name like the Coffee Hut or Caffeine Express or Jolting Java for this super-casual place. Keeping the address in the name makes me remember it all the more since I don&#39;t live in North Beach. Jamie W. and I were strolling feeling a bit peckish after our paninis at Mario&#39;s Bohemian Cigar Store Cafe.We saw a group huddled around the sofa watching the Democratic Convention on a flatscreen, while others were focused solely on their laptops. They appear to serve the typical sandwiches and salads, but we went for the last piece of tiramisu in the glass case. It was really light and tasty, and I have no idea where they get it. But I&#39;d come back for that in an Italian minute.Not much else to say except they serve a good cup of joe, too. If I lived around there, I&#39;d be spending some serious slouching time there. The vibe is so laid back here that it feels like one big Valium in a martini. That&#39;s a compliment actually.COFFEE/DESSERT - 4 stars...that tiramisu was definitely homemade but whose home?AMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...casual to the extremeSERVICE - 3 stars...chill, dudeTOTAL - 4 stars...for a coffee place, sure, I&#39;ll give it four stars

A simple deli, but with truly delicious food. Warm wrap sandwich (chicken, cheese, greens) with an excellent green salad. Fresh fruit cup, even the cantaloupe was tasty. And we all know how rare that is! Flavorful and chewy oatmeal cookie. My favorite part? The homemade iced tea. Black tea, unsweetened. Superb flavor. Savor it, because refills are not free (evidently thanks to surrounding businesses who abused the privilege).

Typing as I&#39;m sitting here. Famous for its speakeasy beer, its a small gem good for studying, reading a book or playing a few rounds of chess.There&#39;s always popular music playing in the background and the coffee&#39;s not bad either.

Bestest, most coffiest deliciousness.Nothing beats this place! Absolute awesome and friendly service, amazing coffee with a great selection, good waffles free wi-fi, soothing atmosphere, I honestly could go on forever (and ever).This is a place to come to when you just wanna hang out, write, read, and drink coffee.And they play The Smiths here quite a bit too! Which makes your coffee shop way less cool, bra.

Nasty nasty customer service. Went to order at the counter and found out its CASH ONLY. Tiny sign on their cash register. We didn&#39;t have any cash on us, only credit card. We apologized and asked to cancel the order (by the way order wasn&#39;t entered yet and no food made). He wouldn&#39;t cancel it and called it unfair. He insisted we pay??? What??? The order wasn&#39;t entered and we didn&#39;t eat or take anything??? I wasn&#39;t sure what&#39;s so unfair but ignored and went to another store. Places like this that demands cash only should be on the watch list for government tax authorities, let alone on the avoid-at-all-cost for most restaurant goers.

-Cash only always is a downer.-The food is pretty good, a little over priced, but I continue to go back.-CHEAP drinks (beer &amp; wine) during happy hour, which is like all day everyday. Really good prices there, but not much of a selection.-It would be a good place to go and get some work done that doesn&#39;t require much focus (searching for apartments, jobs online, etc.), not a good place to study for tests or really do serious work though because the music is really loud and it gets pretty crowded.

I hung out for a few hours at 901 to do some work before heading over to see a Sketchfest show next door. I had never been here before so I wasn&#39;t really expecting much. I ordered a vanilla latte and was surprised at not only how flavorful, foamy and delicious it was - but how pretty it was as well!They have a lot of seating and tables, and their music selection was really great. It ranged from 80&#39;s funk to jazz standards. I believe Borat would say that it was &#34;Very Niiiice.&#34;The Godfather was playing on the flat screen, muted with subtitles so those who wanted to pay attention could. Very cool. I&#39;ll be back soon!

What cool little pace to drink coffee, enjoy some food, cozy up with a good book in the rain, imbibe in some adult libations, or do whatever other leisurely activities that might tickle your fancy when you&#39;ve got some time to kill.Over Thanksgiving weekend, the lady and I decided it&#39;d be a fun idea to get saucy in Sausilito, via cycling across the Golden Gate Bridge. The only problem... was that she didn&#39;t have a bike, so we rented one next door at some touristy spot that typically slings two-wheelers to boners from Nebraska or Ohio.The weather had been rather ominous all day, but it remained clear for the better part of the morning/afternoon... right until she&#39;d signed on the dotted line and we were about to peddle off into Marin County. It started pouring right outside the bike shop, so we decided we&#39;d wait out the storm with a tall cup of coffee across the street at 901.The interior is very warm and inviting. From the street, you&#39;d have no idea it was such a welcoming place to kick your feet up for a while. They had TVs streaming a college football game, a stocked bookshelf with literature to borrow for the day, couches, tables, armchairs and more. Of course, they had a nice selection of coffee drinks, teas, sandwiches, pastries, and all of the other goodies you&#39;d come to expect from a neighborhood coffee joint like this one. Maybe it was just the spirit of our visit (lazy day off, just enjoying the slow-moving afternoon), but there was just the most amazing vibe reverberating throughout the space, and I almost wished the rain would have never stopped.That being said, the storm passed in about 15 minutes, and we were back on the road... but not until I made a serious mental note to come back for a return visit, with at least a good 3-4 hours to spend doing nothing at all.

I always go here while waiting for a show at Cobbs around the corner, when the line reaches my table outside I get up and take my place with the herd.They can be slow here and good luck finding a table but it&#39;s a cool spot with drinks (coffee, booze, etc) and light snacks too.

This is a good choice for a neighborhood cafe in North Beach. Free wifi, lots of seating, and the lattes are pretty good. The food is fine, nothing spectacular, but it is much better (and friendlier) than Sapore at the other end of the block. Some outdoor seating for when the sun is out. Cash only, so don&#39;t forget to hit up the ATM first!

My husband and I recently spent a few days in San Francisco. We were on the way back to our hotel after walking around chinatown and needed a caffeine fix. That&#39;s when we stumbled upon 901 Columbus Cafe. The cafe latte was good and looked beautiful. The chocolate chip cookie was also very good, soft in the center. :)

Sometimes the best place to grab a beer isn&#39;t a bar or pub, it&#39;s the little coffee shop on the corner. I LOVE San Francisco&#39;s independent coffee shops that also happen to serve wine and beer.My friend introduced me to this place--they have a great happy hour that runs until 9 PM where they serve $2 pints of 3 different Speakeasy beers on tap. My friend pointed out that this is even a better deal than the Speakeasy Brewery itself!Other great things about Columbus:- free wi-fi- a bookshelf library with communal books- yummy looking treats- generous seating area- a comfortable environment

Delicious homemade tiramisu to be found here!! It&#39;s baked in a glass pan and is a tad pricey for $5 a slice, but the fluffiness of the whipped cream and the generous espresso flavor makes it a delight worth sharing. We came in late at night, bought the last piece left, and it was still delicious! Even though the place says it closes at 10:00pm, we stayed a few minutes after and no one was rushing to kick us out.

It&#39;s blissfully quiet here on a sunny Saturday afternoon. Spirited red and blue walls, worn by an undulating tide of cafe goers, stand in salute to football (as defined by the rest of the world) playing on the flat screen tv in front of a small leather couch that has seen more than its share of ebullient children and spilt beer. There are no more than a small handful of customers huddled over laptops, ambient instrumentals drifting over their heads.901 is another 1-stop shop cafe offering coffee, breakfast, lunch, beer, and homemade tiramisu. Given the breadth of offerings, you&#39;ll sacrifice nuances like yogurt &amp; granola interpreted as strawberry Yoplait yogurt layered on conventional store-bought granola (in a tiered parfait, no less), but it&#39;s acceptable if you&#39;re simply looking for a quick bite to eat and a place to rest your legs.

Stopped in for a quick lunch while walking from chinatown to fisherman&#39;s wharf. As a fan of bacon, I had to keep it simple and go with the BLTM. Delicious. Crunchy, but still meaty, salty...it really is like meat candy. I&#39;ll have to go back again one day and try some more things on their menu.Yes, their bacon earned them 5 stars.

It&#39;s apparent in other reviews why this cafe is so great.I&#39;ll just say this: If you don&#39;t totally love this place, and especially if you don&#39;t like it for whatever reason, you need to seriously reevaluate your standards as a human being. What more could you want from a cafe? Really?The only way it could possibly be better is if, instead of the 80s music, they played what would normally play on your Pandora (without the random commercials trying to get you to buy diamonds or Sketchers). But you know what? It isn&#39;t physically possible for the cafe to play everyone&#39;s Pandora at the same time-- so shut up, eat your yummy food, drink your $2 speakeasy, and smile.

North Beach is an awesome place for awesome food. You can pretty much go anywhere and the food is good there. The one thing I did notice though is that there was no AC, so on warm days, it&#39;s not very refreshing.The food was really good though, I will say. The bread was nice and toasted and fresh, and the stuff inside the sandwiches were really good too. There was just something about this place that seemed very.. fresh and healthy. Clientele looked like they were frequent visitors to the place and were very relaxed, sitting and reading, enjoying the warm day.Food was good, and North Beach is always awesome for food. I&#39;ll probably be back to this place for another good sandwich. Maybe on a cooler day though.

Very chill music and atmosphere in the evening with very comfortable seating. $2 drafts of Big Daddy. Free Wi-Fi.As a local I love meandering the city and finding cool new places. I immediately fell in love with this place and little did I know this comfortable Friends-ish style cafe was also right next to the comedy clubs and the park on Columbus Ave as well.My only complaint is it gets a little busy and is hard to find a seat sometimes, but everyone seems to keep to themselves and not get too loud conservatively.I definitely need to come by here again more often.

On a lovely Monday morning off work, I decided to revisit my old stomping grounds in Northbeach. After a long walk up Columbus, I ended up at 901 for a cup of coffee, a good book and some free wi-fi.Listening to Johnny Cash on their sound system, watching the cars drive down Lombard street and watching CNN on closed captioning was one of the best ways to start the morning. I only intended to go in for a cup of coffee, but when I saw banana pecan belgian waffles on their menu, I knew I had to have it.The cappuccino was delicious and rich but didn&#39;t have the same beautiful artwork like the pictures. The waffle was the perfect texture--crisp on the outside and soft on the inside topped with banana slices and whipped cream. It was delicious and I was all too happy to spend a fantastic afternoon in a shop with reliable wi-fi and a great cup of coffee. I will be back.

I&#39;m shocked at all the wonderful reviews, because my experience was terrible. I got a take out of the chicken wrap. It was the blandest thing I&#39;ve eaten in quite awhile. Not only that, but there was something wrong with it as it tasted off. I think it was the hummus, as it had a slightly chemical taste to it.I ended up getting food poisoning, as I had some nausea, upset stomach and mild light headedness after eating it. I felt like I wanted to vomit. I know someone else who got take out with me who got sick as well.Definitely not coming here again.

Happened to walk by here on the way to Lombard Street with a friend while acting like tourists. was drawn in by the big happy hour sign which made us sit for a few beers before hiking up the crookedest street in the world (sounded like a good idea at the time).Bartender was extremely nice and the seating arrangement was great. We sat outside (a little chilly) but was able to quickly warm up after a few drinks.Stop on by! Would give 4 stars but definitely trust a local&#39;s review.

I live and work a couple blocks away and decided to try 901 out with a couple colleagues for lunch. It was an utter disappointment.Our group of three ordered two salads and a sandwich wrap. We were one of only three tables that were occupied. It took about twenty minutes to get our food. I&#39;m willing to accept a lengthy wait if the food is stellar, but this wasn&#39;t the case.The food was incredibly mediocre. A $10 sandwich should taste like a $10 sandwich, not a public school lunch. The lettuce was brown on the edges, the flour tortilla on my wrap was gummy. Perhaps the worst offense was the &#34;chicken&#34;. Remember the grilled chicken-like product you were served in school? Basically the white-meat version of particle-board? I&#39;m pretty sure this was the same product. It&#39;s got a spongy, tofu consistency, with a bad aftertaste.My colleagues were equally dissatisfied with their salads and soup.I will probably not be eating here again, which is disappointing because I try to support as many local businesses around here as I can.If you&#39;re thinking of trying 901 out, I&#39;d highly recommend instead going to the other end of the block down Lombard to Caffe Sapore. I&#39;ve eaten there numerous times and have never been disappointed.

I&#39;m generally a big fan of cafes and chugging coffee like there&#39;s no tomorrow. However, when I stopped in 901 Columbus, I took full advantage of their awesome happy hour ($2 drafts FTW!). Sorry, coffee mug, you&#39;ll have to take a backseat this time!I paid 901 a visit with my boo after he and I biked across the Golden Gate Bridge to Sausalito. It was prime time for happy hour so we grabbed a few $2 pints. The place is quaint, staff is friendly and they had foreign films playing on the TV. The cafe is located on a semi- busy corner, which makes for a fun time aka people watching! My bf and I took noticed their fleet of board games and played a round of intense Scrabble. Note: there must be 2 bags of tiles mixed in with one Scrabble board because our Scrabble game lasted foreverrrr and we had a bazillion tiles left over!

I spent a lot of time here. I can guarantee you that the staff thinks I died or was kidnapped by the creep who jacked Elizabeth Smart. I&#39;d job hunt here all day online- sometimes clocking 10 hours-- so I&#39;d say I&#39;m a slight authority on 901. Free wifi. Great space. It&#39;s one of the few coffee shops in SF where you don&#39;t feel cramped. You can work, eat or sit on the sofa and watch the Giants game. 5 PM is quitin&#39; time! $2 brews. Get the &#39;Big Daddy IPA.&#39; It&#39;s super strong. I&#39;m a lush and two would do me in. Nothing like a $4 high. All of the staff (The owner, T, the barista, Alex and other staff are really chill and great.) However, there is one barista (short/angry/always there during the day) who is the biggest prick. He never smiles. He&#39;s rude and 9 times out of 10 he gets your order wrong and acts like it&#39;s your fault. I actually saw him tell a customer he needed to change the keg for the beer he wanted then when the guy went to his table he poured him a beer he didn&#39;t order! This place gets a lot of gullible tourists- so he gets away with it.Don&#39;t let one douche spoil what is otherwise a great spot to grab pints and have a laugh with friends. And, if you see that rude worker- tell him Lianne from New York says to fluck off.

Their coffee (and beer) is good and cheap. I&#39;m no coffee connoisseur, but the price ($2 for a pint glass) is worth it!

I&#39;m usually there for the wireless internet from 6-10, so I don&#39;t know what it&#39;s like earlier in the day. Everyone is super friendly, there&#39;s always games being played on the screen, and it&#39;s generally a cozy atmosphere. I&#39;m a fan of their music choices too--I often find myself foot-tapping to the beat.

This place has a distinctively sitcom-y vibe to it. I mean literally.My mum and I went here for the $2 beer and a $3 glass of wine happy hour after moving me into my new flat in north beach. We both kept commenting on how we expected Ross, Rachel, Chandler, Joey, monica, and Phoebe to show up. you can almost hear &#34;smelly cat&#34; playing in the background.Hahah, but this place is truly neat. Very San Franciscan in that business people come here after work for wifi and a beer and students do the same.

The hubby and I stopped in here after a long day of moving and apartment hunting. We were tired, hungry and in need of coffee. 901 Columbus Cafe was convenient and highly rated. The smiling guy at the counter was eager to take our order so we hastily made our selection, a panini and an iced mocha and chose a table outside as it was way too hot and stuffy to sit inside. The sandwich and coffee came quickly and were good, a nice addition to our afternoon. Although there are so many other shops in the area, this one was reasonably priced, didn&#39;t require a long wait at the hostess table, and was quick. I won&#39;t say it was the best sandwich I&#39;ve ever had in SF, but it wasn&#39;t bad for the money. Another time I&#39;ll have to try out their beer selection and maybe another panini. Overall, nice place, nice people, fast service. That&#39;s good in my book!

Comfy and relaxed atmosphere, decent chai tea lattes and a couple of toasty sandwiches that are 99% satisfying. A good place to stop in for a coffee or a snack.The only issue is that it&#39;s in the middle of tourist central--but, well, so are you.

Bustling cafe that attracts an even amount of tourists and regulars. The high energy atmosphere that I experienced (heightened by the showing of Terminator 2 on one of the TVs) might not be for everyone. Nevertheless, I enjoyed my afternoon working on my laptop here, enjoying the free WiFi and ample outlets. The coffee was good and served with great care by a friendly barista. In short, I&#39;ll be back.

I work here and I love it. Obviously, I&#39;m a little tired of the menu, since I&#39;ve been eating lunch every day for the last couple years, but everything is very fresh, and we won an award for cleanliness from the health inspector. Lots of stuff made in house including the hummus and salad dressings.This is a place I would hang out even if they didn&#39;t pay me. Couch, high definition tv (we&#39;ll let you change the channel), friendly regulars. Of course, much busier on weekends, especially holidays. Wide menu available all the time (including coffee drinks, tea, beer, wine, waffles, granola, bagels, sandwiches, panini, wraps, salads). Open 7-7 daily, including most holidays. Free wifi for your laptop, also desktop computer access for a nominal fee.Stop by and say hi to me, I&#39;ll make you a pretty latte.Edit: Now open until 10 pm every day.

This cafe is everything a great cafe should be- Nice, friendly staff- Comfortable environment- Completely free, unrestricted Wifi- Good music that isn&#39;t too loud- Really good foodI love coming here to study. The employees never care that I take up a table and their wifi for hours at a time while getting coffee refills or drinking free water. I almost always get one of their smoothies when I come here, they&#39;re delicious! The food variety is impressive- wraps, salads, paninis, breakfast bagel sandwiches- and everything I&#39;ve gotten so far has been quite tasty. The vibe here is so chill, they have outdoor seating for when it&#39;s sunny, and their happy hour can&#39;t be beat. I wish every cafe were this great. Only bummer is cash only, but that&#39;s half the places in San Francisco anyway.

Surprisingly good. I wanted to go to a coffee shop and get some work done before heading to Trader Joe&#39;s, and this was nearby. Good atmosphere, reliable wifi, and an iced chai tea latte that tastes like apple butter (which I&#39;m told is an Amish -- not California -- thing).

The barista is RUDE! I asked for a spiced chai tea and the barista gave me a chai latte with whole milk. When I told him I ordered the plain chai tea, he argued with me. He wouldn&#39;t give me my money back or provide me a different type of tea to replace the terrible latte. He also refused to give me a side of eggs, which admittedly wasn&#39;t on the menu but many dishes have eggs. The employees offered service grudgingly and refused to answer questions about the menu.

It&#39;s hard to describe how delicious my Babylonia Sandwich and Strawberry Banana Smoothie were at 901 Columbus. I&#39;ll try, though. (I&#39;m plucky like that.) They were SO delicious, I was humming to myself as I ate, and that&#39;s something I used to do as a kid, but only when I was really happy. The Babylonia is avocado, cucumber, red onion, sprouts, hummus, lettuce, tomato, pickles and cheese, and I had mine on toasted wheat bread. (Check out the photo, which makes me weep with nostalgia.) The smoothie rocked &#39;til the break-a dawn.Maybe I loved it so much because I&#39;d just arrived in San Francisco, and was starving, and probably would&#39;ve been ecstatic to munch on some Wheat Thins. Still, I&#39;d rate the meal highly under any circumstances. Additional temptations on the menu included the Grilled Foccacia &#34;Wise Guy&#34; Sandwich (pesto, chicken, mozzarella, tomato and onion) and the Pastrami Melt.Other plusses: friendly service, cozy seating, free WiFi, cute location (with an outdoor view of Lombard &#39;s &#34;crookedest street&#34; in the distance), and what appeared to be a tiny lending library.

This place is my local favorite for relaxing with friends. It serves perfectly either as a casual place to relax on a warm Saturday afternoon with beers, or as a great cheap place to meet up with friends before heading out to dinner/bars.The panini sandwiches and salads are very tasty if you want to stay here and eat.$2 draft beers! And we&#39;re talking GOOD beer - Firestone Double Barrel Ale is my favorite currently on tap. You just can&#39;t beat that in this city.

The drafts are now $2, but whatever, I&#39;m older, uglier and more expensive these days, too. They&#39;re still $2 from 5 pm to 10 pm.Bagel with hummus and coffee is $4. You can watch European football -- that&#39;s &#34;soccer&#34; to you, meathead -- on the plasma TV, sit on the couch or give tourists bad directions from the tables outside.In sum: all you could want in a neighborhood coffee shop.

Conveniently a minute&#39;s walk away from Tattoo City, I walked in here for some food before my tattoo appointment.The small cafe with free wi-fi boasts affordable breakfast items (nothing over $10) and a lot of sandwiches to choose from.I ended up selecting the Crunchy Tuna sandwich on ciabatta (you have your choice of bread) because it had avocado in it and a Pellegrino Limonata to wash it down with.The sandwich was one of the best tuna sandwiches I&#39;d ever eaten. It had toasty ciabatta, cheese, tomato, pickles, lettuce, sprouts and celery. The tuna mixture wasn&#39;t too creamy nor dry and the avocado was a nice touch. At $8 for the sandwich, it&#39;s a little pricy but I loved every bite of it, before and after my tattoo. Love to go back again!

901 is far and away my favorite coffee shop in North Beach, and I&#39;ve pretty much been to them all: Roma, Greco, Capriccio, Sapore, Trieste, etc. What I like about 901 is the super laid-back vibe - though things do heat up a bit at night during happy hour. The food and coffee are great, but what really makes 901 stand out is the ambiance (great music, nice layout, comfort) and super friendly staff. I&#39;ve also found it&#39;s a great place to read, study, and be productive if you like to work in coffee shops. Reliable Wifi is a big plus. I&#39;ll give you a heads up that the service can be a bit slow, so if you&#39;re in a hurry maybe 901 isn&#39;t your best bet. Aside from that, this place unequivocally rocks.

I was looking for a place to lunch when I bumped into this cosy place. What I like is that it&#39;s a little out of the touristic area&#39;s, so it&#39;s not too crowded. When I was there (2PM on a Saturday) there were some people doing some work on their laptop with the free wifi, some people reading a book, and others were watching the Italian soccer match on tv: just a great relaxing atmosphere.I ordered a sandwich with a cup of tea, and both tasted great. Especially the tuna sandwich was fresh and delicious. The staff was friendly, the music blends into the space and it&#39;s just a nice place to hang out or do some work.

The recipe for a five star cafe:- A delicious menu that can keep me all day. Start me off with a distinctive breakfast, follow that with a vast array of sandwiches and finish it off with an afternoon parfait snack. 901 Columbus delivered on each one - an excellent belgium waffle, a very satisfying turkey on ciabatta (bonus points for not charging to swap mayo for hummus) and a generously sized strawberry filled parfait. And don&#39;t forget the coffee with sugar free syrups - 901 has that covered as well.- Free internet and plenty of outlets. Done and done at 901 Columbus. Too bad I was using it mainly for work.- Friendly and attentive service. Loved how the guys working the counter let me open a tab. I was never rushed, totally could have been there open to close and no one would have cared.Next time I might.

One of the best coffee shops in the neighborhood. A variety of great breakfast and lunch items and good coffee drinks.After 5pm, they have $2 beers. Sit outside, play a boardgame, drink cheap beers, and people watch. Sounds like a great afternoon to me.They also have a great assortment of boardgames, and two computers to use for a cheap rate if you need to hop on the internet.Two negatives- cash only. And because this place is so popular, sometimes service is slow. But if you don&#39;t have any place to go, this is a great place to sit and hang out.It&#39;s a coffee shop you def. want to spend time in...not just hop in and hop out.

I went to 901 Columbus Caffe for a quick dinner before class and it was okay. I had a good vegetarian wrap which took about 10 minutes to make even though there were only a few people there and no one else had ordered food. There is a lot of seating and free wi-fi which is nice. The music is pretty loud which makes it a little hard to study. Cash only.

If you like the feel of a local coffee shop coupled with great coffee, excellent sandwiches and free WIFI, look no further.I had the breakfast burrito with eggs, spinach, cheese and bacon. This thing was grilled on a panini press and was served piping hot. Okay I&#39;m hungry again.The coffee was also exceptional - I opted for the regular instead of the flavored. Since that is usually my preference, I hold high standards for the flavor of the actual bean (no hazelnut to drown out a sub-par bean). This one passes the test with flying colors.One thing worth noting is that there is a $5 minimum purchase for credit cards.We will definitely return when we visit SF again!

I&#39;ve been here several times, especially when I lived in NB. I love 901&#39;s waffles and paninis. They are delicious! I also dig the environment. It&#39;s mellow, yet helps get the juices flowing if you need to do some serious work. The people are pretty nice here and 901 draws a good crowd.One Sunday morning, my bf and I were earnestly looking for a place to eat some food, have coffee and just enjoy a nice Sunday breakfast. After looking for parking for what seemed like FOREVER, we walked up to this restaurant packed with patrons. Without time to kill, we left. 901 was across the street so we went there. They definitely helped resolved our hungry bellies and my thirst for caffeine.I have yet to go there for happy hour but I can only imagine it&#39;s a chill spot to have a couple of beers and chat with friends.Good stuff. Two thumbs up!

The draft beers are quite good and the happy hour is very reasonable in cost. The cookies have been good sometimes and just so so other times. In general the food is good, but slightly overpriced. The espresso is good, but the coffee has not always been the best. I&#39;ve had it a few times when it was luke warm and kind of burnt tasting. This place is a good place to study in the day time, large tables and plugs for your laptops.

Their lattes are great and they have these amazing aromatic waffles that beg to be ordered. The chocolate one has poof of cream and the blueberry one takes my vote for favorite.And what&#39;s better than $1.50 drafts! Save up your laundry money and spend it all here! Outdoor seating has made it more of a chill place in the evenings where people smoke butts and have what I&#39;d imagine to be life-changing conversation.Staff is real nice, unlike another reviews suggests. Believe that. I go here often, too. Place gets crammed though from the tourist rush, so don&#39;t get cranky if you have to wait. Peace.

Planned on writing my xmas cards and having a glass of wine and stumbled upon Monday movie night, nice since I don&#39;t have tv or cable (gasp) at my new place. Good food and I think the menu said happy hour every day from 5-10?!? or maybe my eyes deceived me. Good soup and nice crowd, think I will be hanging out there to people watch and relax on the couch with a good book.

Just moved to the neighborhood and looking for a regular &#34;go-to&#34; spot near by. Happened in on this place because of the $2 beer sign outside. Had a salad, which was great and very huge. Also, there&#39;s a few outdoor tables, which is a huge plus. I&#39;d say though that the food is a little overpriced (though it&#39;s really made up in what you pay for beer) and that it&#39;s a little dark and cluttered inside. But all in all, this is definitely a contender for my usual spot.

They&#39;re open later! Yay! And the schwerma is still great- that chili sauce &amp;amp; yoghurt hits home. Also- the happy hour deal is unreal, as other yelpers attest.

Strolled in here after spening 4 hours exploring russian hill on foot. Peckish for a panini, I ordere a pastrami one and it satisfied my expectations indeed. The cappuccino was the best I&#39;ve tried even beats blue bottle... this place commands the repeat of a visit.

I come here many weekends for breakfast and coffee. For breakfast I usually get the yogurt granola parfait, a waffle, or a bagel sandwich. All hit the spot. Prepare to wait a while for your breakfast/lunch on the weekends since they get pretty busy and don&#39;t have much help in the kitchen area. There is a good seating area with free wifi inside, and also seating outside for warm days.

We chose this cafe one afternoon because it was the midway point btwn our house and the hotel where our friends (country mice freed from their children for the day) were staying.We had coffee, bagels and biscotti and it was all delicious.I loved our Lodi bagel; feta cheese, tomatoes, basil and olive oil. Nummers!I hope we have an excuse to come here again because their whole menu looked oh so good!

The sandwiches here are delicious and a great deal for the money. They average $7-9 and are pretty big. The atmosphere is great for just kicking back or getting some work done. It kind of feels like a cafe fused with a bar. There&#39;s free wi-fi and $1.50 draft beers from 5-10pm everyday. With both outside and indoor seating, you can really make this place work for any situation. Service is friendly, although you can expect to wait 5-10 minutes for your sandwich. But boy, is it worth the wait. Paninis, wraps, whatever you choose - they&#39;re all wonderfully delicious. Plenty of vegetarian options, too.

If I&#39;m in North Beach it&#39;s my default coffee shop. I will try new places as the urge strikes me, but if I need somewhere to be for a while this is a good choice. Open wireless and available outlets mean I can take my laptop and relax. Staff has always been attentive, polite, and interesting, moreso in all categories than I generally expect at a coffee shop.

this place would be a perfect location for a starbucks. i don&#39;t think there is one within 2 blocks so whats the deal? ;)i sit and write chez 901 as a host of locals and tourons alike alight to imbibe and nourish. a little girl with her own mini stroller just walked out the door with her prego mommy. there is a horror flick on the flatscreen and a hot curly haired girl banging away on her black mac. the wait staff is super friendly and the pastrami sandy i had yesterday was terrific.so what&#39;s it all about? i feel dry bowled creatively since our latest investor prospect decided to make us look stupid but i will say that this is a good lower no. beach hang. free wireless and though the occasional busload of chinese tourons descends, its never too crowded to find a spot to work.so eat heavy...

i can&#39;t believe i have been going to school for two years down the street from this place and i just discovered it a few weeks ago. i feel like everything i have tried here is good. good smoothies, excellent vegetarian sandwiches with a variety of options like feta cheese and basil, avocado and sprouts, you name it. the servers are nice too. one stopped me on the street and said hi! (i might have a small crush on one guy who works here, shhhh)edit: i went there today and had my first bad experience. i ordered a bodega on wheat bread and one server totally forgot to give it to me. i was sitting right there the whole time.:( maybe i&#39;ll get something for free next time, you know, after my boycott.

The coffee is great, the outside tables have sun for most of the day and the owner is almost always there making sure that things run smoothly. The food is good and they also have beer on tap. Sometimes it gets a bit crowded with tourists headed up Lombard Street, try it on a weekday.

Love this place. Great environment, good food, the best Chai I&#39;ve had in SF, and the $2 draft beers are a great way to transition away from a workday. Friendly staff and a few choice seats round out a great caffe.

This place was awesome. The paninis were good, they serve beer, are a decent price and it has a cozy atmosphere. I can&#39;t wait to go back.

Love the neighborhoody vibe, the board games, the comfy couches. Great waffles- banana pecan and strawberry chocolate chip were delicious! Tasty smoothies and fruit juices. I had something called Cubana or something; watermelon and lime juices fresh squeezed and blended- the perfect drink on a summer day

I used to live across the street from this place and I miss it dearly. Fresh food, great coffee, and very nice owners. It was like my version of Central Perk. Seriously. Couldn&#39;t walk by without popping inside. I miss you 901!

Free Wi-Fi. Super friendly staff. Great coffee and tea drinks (my wife drinks the coffee and I drink the tea). And, some nice little food dishes. Plus, they have a beer and wine license, so it&#39;s a great little spot to have a business meeting and have all the options available.

Possibly the best atmosphere in North Beach, but with the worst coffee. They could serve instant coffee, though, and I would still come here every day. It feels like a living room, with a couch and a tv, and the staff here is awesome and sweet. Order a cappuchino or a zebra mocha instead, which are both great.
