Holy moly, this place is awesome.Super cozy with an old-school, locals only, authentic North Beach vibe.Meatball sandwich and house-made Campari are out of this world.Really needn&#39;t say more. Just go.

I have gone once to Marios and enjoyed my food. My finance love his meatball sandwich. I wish my lasagna had more cheese but not sure if it&#39;s traditional to have more cheese. The ingredients seemed fresh and service was decent. Hope to go again sometime and try some new dishes.

Although I love Italian foods, I am not a big fan of restaurants that are located in North Beach. However, Mario&#39;s is an exception. This place feels really warm and homey. It is kinda of tight inside and they have only few tables. I guess that&#39;s what makes this place so cozy. Oh, and the food is also great!I think I had one of the best meatball sandwiches of my life at Mario&#39;s. It&#39;s oven baked, with perfect amount of fresh marinara sauce. I am saying perfect, because most places drown their meat in sauce and in here they don&#39;t do that. The bread is not soggy, yet very tender.So, if you are into oven baked sandwiches or love meatballs you should definitely checkout this place. They also have beer and wine, which is nice if you want to stay there for a little while and relax.Beware, the place is kind of low on staff and they take long to prepare your food. So, if you just want to grab a quick snack, and are in a rush then this place might not be the best option for you.

If you want to experience real San Francisco, try here. That&#39;s what I was told by a long time friend/business partner in San Francisco.Great place to grab your lunch, afternoon snack in a lazy slow afternoon. Enjoy the view of the Washington Park.I ordered grilled eggplant open sandwich and flavor was amazing. Taste fresh ingredients inside the sandwich, I enjoyed every bite of it. I came by a car and parking was difficult to find. If I wasn&#39;t driving, I would definitely have tried some of their drinks, sitting by the window, watching people enjoying sunny afternoon at the park.Very small cafe, service could be slow but that wasn&#39;t my concern. I was just three relaxed enjoying late lunch on weekend.

After a trek through Chinatown and some noontime beers at Rogue across the street, I was jonesing for a fresh caprese. The bartender suggested Mario&#39;s as an industry fave so we headed over and found two seats at the bar. Most options were hot, either panini or pressed focaccia. The cook was either new or busy, because he seemed super flustered and forgot the pesto on my sandwich and gave my boyfriend the wrong one.They were both good so we didn&#39;t mind much either way, but we also had nowhere to be and were starving!

I stopped in on my first day back in San Francisco for an 8-day trip to see friends and family.I was wandering around North Beach, anxious from hunger. The anxiety turned me off of every crowded restaurant I walked by, until I had walked by the last restaurant on Columbus. Annoyed with myself, I turned around, hungrier and more anxious.Too famished to be people-averse any longer, I pounced when I saw a table opening up outside of Mario&#39;s Bohemian Cigar Store Cafe. As someone with hunger-induced social anxiety, it was fantastic to be immediately welcomed by the bartender, who instructed me to sit anywhere I liked. My waiter was very attentive and funny. I had a really nice americano and panini, followed up with a pre-tech-boom bill. I spoke with the owner for half an hour or so; he was incredibly nice and charming.They really kicked off my vacation and I will make it a point to stop back in!

The server didn&#39;t come by for 30 minutes and then I went up to her and attempted to order and she said in a very aggressive way &#34;go sit down! I&#39;ll come to you later&#34;. Seriously?! Granted it&#39;s likely understaffed, but that&#39;s not my fault, and doesn&#39;t constitute extreme rudeness. I haven&#39;t made a comment in a while but I feel so violated right now I had to share this. 1 star.Update: I initially liked the ambiance and music, and who knows maybe the server is going through a hard time or something, and I liked the food. I shall do 3 stars.Update again: the polenta was wack. 2 stars.

Cute little place- stopped here in a sunny day to get Italian sodas. Wanted to make them Italian creme sodas and was shocked to find out they don&#39;t have cream? Um, a coffee place that only has milk? Wtf?But, place is super cute and staff was relatively friendly.If you&#39;re in the neighborhood, there are a ton of coffee places- I&#39;m certain most of them have half and half or cream- this is a cute place to stop and rest your feet. It overlooks an adorable park. But be prepared to drink coffee with milk... Gasp!

Crowded with a lovely seating overlooking the busy streets of san Francisco. Understaffed yet efficient. We got our orders in under 10 minutes. Courteous staff, sizeable portions.

Talk about a great meatball sandwich! I come in here every few months and I always get the same thing: The meatball sandwich!Don&#39;t let the sign fool you,they don&#39;t sell cigars. Sorry.But that I mention they have the best meatball sandwich. Yes I sure did because it&#39;s awesome!I brought my dad in there a few months ago and he is a food critic because he&#39;s a chef, and he love the meatball sandwich also. We followed that with a double espresso each and called it a day. Very happy customers.It&#39;s not the best place for groups that a lot of tables for two.They also have outdoor seating that Overlooks Washington Sq., Park and that&#39;s a great place to people watch.

Great place to grab a cold beer, or a coffee drink, sit and watch the crowd roll by. Across the street is the always green Washington Square Park and beyond it the beautiful Saints Peter and Paul Church. On the right you can get a good glimpse of Coit Tower. So visually you will not get bored, but you may get hungry! My favorite at Mario&#39;s is their meatball sandwich which is served on locally baked Focaccia bread. If it is too cold for you to sit outside, sit at the bar and chat with the people around you. Even though many tourists stop there, it is also a favorite hangout of the locals and they always have interesting tips for you if you are visiting.

When you drive by Mario&#39;s and there&#39;s a parking space right outside, you have to take it. Then you must go into Mario&#39;s, grab a seat at the bar and order a beer and a meatball sandwich. They serve it on Liguria green onion foccacia and toast it in the oven. That sandwich is one of the most delicious things that you&#39;ll ever eat: the perfect amount of sauce, cheese and meatballs nestled inside the best toasted foccacia. With pepperoncini on the side.I&#39;ve also had the eggplant sandwich and it was heaven as well, but for some reason I almost always gravitate towards the meatballs.

Went here for a quick dinner with a friend. Initially sat outside but soon moved in as the wind picked up. I had the special panino - prosciutto with mozzarella, red onion and substituted pesto for red peppers. Sandwich was warm and chewy, a good balance of meet, cheese and bread. Service was efficient and friendly, and place had a laid back neighborhood feel. Menu options were somewhat limited, but what they have seems quality.

The food here is pretty good. Grilled sandwiches, coffee - it all tastes good. However, to spend 1 HOUR waiting for your food is unacceptable under any circumstances.We walked in, sat down immediately and within 5 minutes our order was taken and drinks arrived. What happened next was akin to waiting for deliverance. After 20 minutes and no food, I wanted to get up and leave, but said to myself that we waiting a while already and the food should be about done. 20 minutes more and by now y stomach is rumbling. Another 20 minutes and still no food. At this point it&#39;s basically a joke.The food they serve is basic. Salads, sandwiches, and mini pizzas. Doesn&#39;t seem like rocket science. After inquiring about our food, we found our one of our plates was just sitting on the counter for 5 minutes. Completely unacceptable, and I will say this confidence I will NEVER be back, no matter how good the food is.

Mario&#39;s was one of the few places I stumbled upon during my trip to San Francisco. I was hungry for lunch and was intrigued by the name, so decided to head inside.First off, service was friendly but soooo slow. There were only two guys working and the place was pretty busy. I&#39;m happy I didn&#39;t have anything strict on my schedule or else I would have had to get up and leave.Food wise, I ordered half of a Mario&#39;s salad and half of the highly recommended meatball sandwich. The salad was fine, just your average house salad, but the meatball sandwich was great! The meatballs and sauce were so delicious, and it was covered in melty provolone cheese. Yum.If I ever return perhaps I&#39;ll order to-go and avoid the long wait?

Take note: this establishment is highly unfriendly to anyone just looking for a place to sit down and enjoy a drink.I had been seated not a full two hours before being asked--rather rudely I&#39;d add--to vacate my seat for a customer looking to have dinner. I understand dinner-goers offer more revenue to the Cafe than patrons ordering a single drink, but to effectively evict someone after so little time and with so little decorum is nonetheless despicable.Will never be coming here again.

Is this the most amazing Italian food you&#39;ve ever had? no. Is this most amazing service and experience in SF? Probably not. Is this the perfect place to perch on a warm Saturday afternoon, sipping house wine and people watching in the park while listening to mellow blues? YES!On the edge of Washington square park and in the heart of North beach lies this little gem of a bar. Completely unpretentious and inviting, a two person operation on a busy holiday weekend still felt chill and relaxed. We ordered with our eyes (the caprese salad - which was surprisingly light given all the cheese and meat on the plate) and sipped on the &#39;house&#39; white wine. The bar is comfortable and the staff is efficient. When I explain everything individually - it sounds like it&#39;s &#39;nothing special&#39;, but if you put all the elements into an equasion, it&#39;s perfect harmony and a great place to put your feet up for awhile and enjoy San Francisco.Definitely recommend to tourists and locals.

The warm sausage sandwich on toasted green onion foccacia bread is to die for. It&#39;s so filling that I often order just a half sandwich. I guess I&#39;ve been ordering it for 47 years and it&#39;s still wonderful and tastes the same as it did in 1967. On rare occasions I order the meatball sandwich which I guess is equally as good but even though I&#39;m an experimental Gemini, I seem to end up with the sausage version.Get it with a beer or Orangeno soft drink and you can&#39;t go wrong. Their deserts are limited but their cake has always been good and fresh although I usually go across Columbus to Mara&#39;s Bakery for canolli or a raspberry ring unless the ahole owner is there who seems to hate everyone unless you are a local Italian.I have to thank a long out of print booklet titled &#34;My Secret San Francisco&#34; for turning me onto Marios Bohemian Cigar Store which I don&#39;t know if they ever sold cigars.

SUPER hipster, but a damn good sandwich.My friend and I were feeling some sandwiches so she&#39;d suggested this place. Super glad she did.It feels much more like a bar than a sandwich spot. And it has a very hipster feel. But I can&#39;t deny that they made a ridiculously good meatball sandwich. The meat, the sauce, the bread, the cheese...all of the things!!So on a nice summer day enjoy the outside seating, or even go across the street and eat in the park. But wherever you eat it, you&#39;ll enjoy the sandwich.

Before darkening their door, I beg of you to: Open your wallet and eat what cash you find. You&#39;ll surely economize and enjoy a better meal.To those unfortunates who are drawn here on a nostalgic pilgrimage (as in the case of a friend we accompanied) or who have read a guide book shepherding you here: Your memories simply are not reliable (it&#39;s true) and neither are paid industry hacks.Cardboard-textured chicken, burnt coffee, bland canned sauces. As if I need to remind you, dear reader, this city is brimming with marvelous cuisine. Why insult your tongue with their formulaic, lazy offering?Two stars for the period nostalgia of its location and proximity to a charming park.

I love Mario&#39;s. It&#39;s a neighborhood staple. It seems like all the service complaints are from people that anyone that has ever worked in hospitality would hate to serve. The ambiance is very European and the food is tasty and affordable. Every staff member, even during busy times, is polite and has served me quickly. If you&#39;re expecting servers to bend over backwards, try the Four Seasons or some other basic trashcan. This is a great place for industry folks to hangout and meet friendly people. This is a slice old San Francisco at its best. You&#39;re welcome North Beach.

After having the meatball focaccia sandwich bookmarked for ages I think that I waited to long to finally try it. Not because I&#39;ve been missing out but because so many good sandwich shops are now in business. So whereas the meatballs were tender and the sandwich was okay, it just wasn&#39;t great.I guess if I lived nearby I would stop by more often not because of the food but because of the vibe. It&#39;s apparent that this place attracts regulars who banter with each other and the staff during the day. Very cozy and convivial atmosphere.

This place is the definition of hole in the wall. I suspect it&#39;s less than 500 sq ft in total. The kitchen is really just an oven. It&#39;s remarkable that the food is so good. The meatball Sammie is delectable and the caprese was fantastic. Wine and beer were good too. But depending on how many people are actually present when you arrive your experience would vary a lot. We sat outside waited a really long time for a menu. Ordered and waited a really long time for our food. We finally found a table inside and moved in. Service was way better inside. BF said that there was only one waitress but really I don&#39;t think customer service should be affected because of the owners understaffing. Some people came in after us and were seated right away, I&#39;m sure they had a 4-5 star experience. Food was good. If you have a lot of time to kill come here and relax and enjoy a meal. Don&#39;t come here if you&#39;re in a rush, you&#39;ll go crazy.

I&#39;ve stopped by here on numerous occasions and I&#39;ve always had a good meal. The sandwiches and pizza are just the right amount for the right price and the staff have always been great.This last time I stopped in I came and sat at the bar as a lone diner with a book. I ordered my food and the bartender noticed that my nose kept running. I thought it was due to allergies. He brought me a port with hot water in it because he said, &#34;This is what I have when my nose is running.&#34; Sure enough, it cleared up my nose for the entire day. I&#39;m sure if I didn&#39;t bury myself in my book there would&#39;ve been much more chatting going on. I&#39;ll have to thank him for the runny nose cure and catch his name next time I stop in. I didn&#39;t feel rushed but since it was starting to get busy I figured I should get going since I had finished eating.I know this place is small so I never bring more than 3 other people with me max. I like that it has a cozy feel to it that a lot of places these days seem to lack.You won&#39;t find cigars here but you&#39;ll find a lot of regulars who just want to have a drink or a quick no frills meal. The prices have gone up a little bit since I&#39;ve been going here but I think that&#39;s expected in a city such as this one and it&#39;s way more reasonable than a lot of other places along Columbus.

Extremely poor service, well if you get it I guess. We got a seat at the bar and sat there for 10 minutes waiting for even an acknowledgement/menu. We took it upon ourselves to then ask after being looked at several times. Waited another few minuted with hope, no menus instead brushed over by larger parties walking in the door. This &#34;bohemian&#34; greeting must actually be more- were too good to give you the time of day.

A Iconic sandwich and cocktail pit stop while wandering through North Beach. The place has an alluring smell from the years of caked on grease on the one deck oven that sits at one end of the bar.

Oh wow!I am sitting here beginning the digestion of one of the yummiest sandwiches ever eaten!I got the eggplant open faced half sandwich. I wish I&#39;d gotten the full now ( even though I don&#39;t need it! ) because the tastes are extraordinary.I&#39;m a bit of a food snob vegetarian and a little sick of people lack of creativity when it comes to veggie dishes. They&#39;re usually eggplant or portobello mushroom based... And I usually boycott them as a result of their blandness and ubiquitousness. I am so glad that I didn&#39;t here! I would highly recommend this sandwich to anyone... Veggie and meat eaters alike.Also there a nice view of the park and the church is just eclipsed behind a willow tree.The ambiance is low key and the price are very reasonable. The bartenders are pleasant but a bit distant.I will be returning, hungrier, and for the full sandwich!!! The beer&#39;s not bad either!

Stopped here for a couple of cappuccinos after dinner, the vibe is grey. It is a old time bar with a coffe shop atmosphere. The beer comes in huge mugs, wine is served here as well. There is even a pizza oven and some other menu items. It&#39;s a great corner stop to arch the hustle of little itally.

This review is based on after dinner drinks and dessert. We arrive into the tiny place and there are two free tables, so we grab one and take a seat. Time passes and the server comes over and we order a drink each and 3 desserts. A lot more time passes. Drinks weren&#39;t complicated, 2 draft beers and 2 glasses of wine.We&#39;re started to get antsy, bummed that are incredible dinner out can end like this, but finally the server comes over with....the dessert. Where do you serve food before drinks? When asked if we could get the drinks, the server replied &#34;as you can see, we are really busy tonight.&#34; There are 5 tables, so if that&#39;s busy....well, we have problems.At any rate we wait...and...wait for the drinks. Why start eating dessert when you have no liquid to wash it down? Drinks were the highlight because two of the three desserts were unedible. The chocolate cake was dry and tasted like a cake from Cosco. My ricotta cheesecake was reminiscent of a quiche, eggy tasting and like the chocolate cake, dry. I took one bite and pushed it the side. Tiramisu that my friend ordered was decent.Server came by about 15 minutes later and I told him I didn&#39;t enjoy the cake. He said, &#34;it&#39;s supposed to taste that way, it has ricotta.&#34; OK, but the point is I don&#39;t like it. Bill comes with cheesecake charged on it. I don&#39;t understand this, I didn&#39;t like it, I didn&#39;t eat it, but you are still going to charge me?Bad service, bad desserts so I won&#39;t be going back.

Came here for lunch today with some co-workers since we work really close by! It&#39;s a cute little cafe with a catchy name and I&#39;ve been wanting to try this place! I ordered the breaded eggplant sandwich while my coworkers ordered lasagna, chicken salad, and polenta &amp; sausage. After taking a few bites of my eggplant sandwich, I ended up opening it up so I can add in some salt &amp; pepper. It was a little too bland for my taste, in which one of my coworkers agreed also. As for the breaded eggplant, it was thinner than I thought it would be! If I do come back, maybe I will try a pizza instead next time!

Came here with my boyfriend after seeing the great reviews. We saw a few reviews that warned about the service but thought, well if the food is good who cares. After an hour and a half of waiting (with people who came much later than us receiving the same food we ordered) I was ready to get up and leave. The food came right then and I thought this better be as good as the reviews mentioned. We got a meatball sandwich and a pizza and let me tell you, it was mediocre (and I was starving so that says something). You could go to literally any other Italian cafe in this area and have something better that doesn&#39;t take an hour and a half. Oh and I forgot to mention, the servers were pretty unpleasant. Needless to say, I suggest you avoid this place.

Was visiting North Beach today while it was just sunny and gorgeous outside (yes, I am talking about San Francisco) and happened to stop by the window and read their menu. Don&#39;t expect something fancy here, just some simple, flavorful creations.I had the grilled eggplant panini with mozzarella instead of feta cheese and I loved it. Simple flavors, nice and warm... it was just what I wanted.I really welcomed the laid back nature of this place. You don&#39;t experience the over-zealous Italians greeting you at the sidewalk to reel you in which was so great. Just some friendly guys, making sandwiches and pouring beers. This place is a great escape from the hustle of touristy North Beach, right on the edge of Washington Square.

It really can feel like like Europe on a lazy weekday afternoon in North Beach and we&#39;re not talking about the number of tourists. Sitting out in the sunshine at Mario&#39;s Bohemian Cigar Store Cafe overlooking Washington Square Park is a nice staycation thing to do.Now to be honest the food isn&#39;t that special. You can get better sandwiches elsewhere but the charm isn&#39;t really the food. I&#39;ve had paninis here before but more often than not, I end up just grabbing a nice cold beer to relax and watch the day go by. It&#39;s a take it slow kind of place. Service here is never hurried so it complements the whole kick-back experience.Come for the experience and relax, take your time, and enjoy.

We stop here every time we are in San Francisco. We took some friends visiting from France here and they commented that the atmosphere and bistro style seating was the most European cafe they&#39;d been to on their trip to California. The food is great and whether you sit inside or outside it is a perfect place to relax and people watch as it directly across from Washington Square Park. It has a lot of character and for us it is one of our favorite stops in North Beach.

Frommer&#39;s includes a stop here during Day 1 of San Francisco and who are we to disagree? We were quickly seated and told that the kitchen was backed up - a nice touch. We ordered drinks, a half salad and two sandwiches: mom and I split a meatball and K got an eggplant.The dressing on the salad was a little odd but the lettuce was great. The sandwiches were good but very different from the East Coast version on which I grew up: they use Swiss cheese here, a really different twist. Both servers were incredibly nice local hipsters who clearly cared about the job they were doing and answered our initial barrage of questions about the beer on the menu with which we weren&#39;t familiar.Very good way to break up the day!

Mario&#39;s Bohemian Cigar Store is one of the oldest cafes in North Beach, (and maybe the US) and was founded by Mario Crismani and his wife, Liliana. They serve oven baked Focaccia Sandwiches (and other Italian fare), beer, wine, coffee, great desserts, but no cigars.Gayle and I have been here on a date, and were lucky to find a table at this very compact and authentic corner space. It&#39;s also cool to see Washington Square park across the street and watch the world (including a few Bohemians of course) go by. The food was good, the service was &#34;direct&#34;, the energy was exciting, and the decor was homey. In other words, it&#39;s a real North Beach neighborhood experience.

And amazingly not rammed full of tourists like some places on Columbus Avx although that may change on weekends...worthy of my 1st yelp review! Had to write something about this place, loved it

Perfectly satisfied with the meatball and the combination sandwiches. Meatball sandwich is pretty good. I ate the combination sandwich the day after, so it definitely is not as good as if it was eaten there. The focaccia bread is yummy, but it&#39;s really thick and 1 dimensional? I probably prefer a panini myself.Tiramisu tastes amazing! I finish the entire dessert myself. I like how it&#39;s a bit wet and very flavorful.I used a HomeRun voucher with me and there&#39;s a little bit of confusion on whether the expiry date has passed. He stared at the voucher for a good 10 minutes before giving me the americano and water. The owner doesn&#39;t seem too pleased with the voucher in general I&#39;d guess, so I definitely advice against buying any vouchers for this place. And this is validated by another reviewer&#39;s crazy experience before mine!

We&#39;re talking about casual eats in a classic setting (see my photos). This place probably represents the third corner of the North Beach triad that includes Caffe Trieste and Victoria&#39;s Pastry Company. OK, maybe you have to add Caffe Sport and Steps of Rome. OK, maybe not Steps of Rome because they lick your neck there. Well, not mine, but Rachael Ray&#39;s, I think, on that $40-a-Day-Cause-I&#39;m-Too-Rich-to-Tip show. Oh my gravy.But back to Mario&#39;s. Big bar, little tables inside, a few more outside. Lots of Italian-style atmosphere - bottles of Chianti against the wall, a picture of a boccie ball player, those old artful advertising posters you see at Z Gallerie. Yet again sparked by a complete stranger&#39;s adoration of this place on &#34;Check Please! Bay Area&#34;, Jamie W. and I went to see what the fuss was about. The menu is small but focused - focaccia sandwiches, paninis, three salads, a few pizzas, some lasagna, some eggplant parmigiana, and a few desserts. That&#39;s it.We went for splitting two paninis, both in the $7.50-$8.50 range (see my photos). The verdict is that the salami was really good, and the chicken one a little too dry. But the bread was nice and crunchy. It comes with no extras except for a couple of pepperoncinis - which was a bit disappointing since I never turn down fries. We decided to order the $6 Caprese, which consisted of four thick, somewhat unripened tomato slices with a slab of mozzarella and a dollop of fresh basil pesto (see my photo). All in all, it&#39;s a good snack place but nothing much more than that except for a great spot overlooking Washington Square.FOOD - 3 stars...good, toasty paninis but nothing extraordinary hereAMBIANCE - 4 stars...feels like a good paisan&#39;s hangoutSERVICE - 3.5 stars...friendly enough, not as indifferent as I was expectingTOTAL - 3 stars...the small servings bring this one down a little...also the easy-to-screw-up name with three nouns in a row...make up your mind!

Tried this place about four times now and have mixed reviews. The sandwiches taste great, but on the pricy side for not coming with chips or a salad...they need to improved their customer service, it takes them a while to get to you for being such a small place...I will continue to go there when I&#39;m not in a rush, the paninis are that good

The place is a rustic looking bar, located in an odd shaped corner, with indoor and outdoor seating overlooking Washington Square park. It&#39;s a great local cafe, well suited for lingering while sipping on your cup of cappuccino, latte, or wine (or whatever you like to drink), and enjoying the view of the park and the people that walk by. Despite the name they don&#39;t sell cigars here (they just kept the name).Their menu includes focaccia and panini sandwiches, a few salads, pizza, a few hot dishes (cannelloni, lasagna, eggplant parmigiana, polenta with sausage), coffees and bar drinks (beer, wine, etc.). Surprisingly, they have a lot of vegetarian options in the menu. I like the focaccia sandwiches. They are open-faced, so it&#39;s more like getting 2 &#39;mini pizza&#39; (they sell personal pizzas also), with the toppings and melted cheese on top of the delicious+toasted+fluffy focaccia bread (from the famous Liguria bakery). I have tried the chicken #1, meatball with marinara and onions, and the veggie. Sandwiches are $9.75, and the half sandwiches are $5.50. It&#39;s a little pricey for sandwiches, but this is an expensive tourist area, so it goes with the territory.And don&#39;t forget to get a slice of cake for dessert ($4). I like their homemade Ricotta Cheese Cake - this is not a &#34;cheesecake&#34;, this is a cake that has cheese in it. Let me explain, think of this like a moist cake with a built-in custard in the bottom part. Their chocolate cake is good too.The place is usually busy, and they use a small oven to make all the sandwiches, so the wait for food could be long (like I said before: good for lingering). If there are no seats available, I recommend that you place the order to go, come back in 10-15 minutes to pick it up, and enjoy a picnic in the park across the street.*******************Additional tip:FYI, if you prefer a cheaper sammie instead (not grilled, no focaccia), you could go to Petite Deli (~$6, ciabatta bread, long wait time also) which is only 3 blocks away from Mario&#39;s down Columbus Ave, past the WS park (PD closes at 4pm M-F/ 3pm Sat, closed on Sundays). And while you&#39;re at PD, maybe get some yummy chocolate truffles next door at XOX Truffles (XOX closes at 6pm).

Situated near Washington Square Park, Mario&#39;s Bohemian Cigar Store Cafe (that&#39;s a mouthful) is a great place to lounge around with some good ol&#39; Italian cooking, a meatball sandwich, and a few ice-cold pints. Also a perfect place to people-watch if that&#39;s your thing. Mario&#39;s has a certain charm about it that you may notice when you step inside. It&#39;s relaxed. It&#39;s small. Even the service is pretty relaxed. Don&#39;t expect chipper, happy-go-lucky waitresses taking your order in harmonious sing-song voices. Rather, the service is no-nonsense, you&#39;ll get your shit when it comes.The meatball sandwich is indeed a delight! Melted mozzarella and meatball with marinara sauce on toasted onion focaccia bread. I love how gooey the cheese is (definitely not a clean eat). The sandwich, among most other things on the menu, are priced reasonably at around 8-15 dollars.Spend a warm, sunny (you get a few in SF) afternoon here on your next visit to North Beach!

Daang! This place always does me right.I love the vibe that this place brings. Super chill and laid back, if this is not you, then go else ware.If you appreciate good sandwiches and like to accompany it with a good jammy wine or a cold crisp beer this is your place. They brew up a good cup of joe,so quit reading this and go hit it up.

This is a nice enough little place, but I just have to weigh in negatively on the meatball sandwich. The ingredients are ok (the foccacia is nice of course), but it&#39;s cooked in that little oven and mine got singed and smokey, which was not good. I liked that they had a half-sandwich offering ($5.50 rather than $9.75), but they didn&#39;t mention the half is open-faced - not bad, just something I&#39;d like to have known. The beer selection was fairly limited. I would recommend going one block over and getting an excellent meatball sandwich (or spectacular pizza) at Tony&#39;s Slice House.

Some of the best sandwiches in the neighborhood! The bread comes from the focaccia bakery a few blocks over, by far the best bread I&#39;ve ever had so it adds a lot to the sandwiches. The grilled sandwiches are the best, my favorite is the chicken #1. The guys that run it are super old school and refuse to do any substitutions but you really wouldn&#39;t want any!

Food is very nice - A little overpriced for the sandwiches and &#39;weak&#39; italian soda&#39;s, but it is San Francisco after all.What lets this place down is the service - or lack thereof. I realize when things are busy the servers might take longer to take an order or check on you, but today was the final straw. Considering I have been here a few times before, I expected to wait five minutes for the staff to acknowledge me, but twenty minutes of sitting outside and I still didn&#39;t have a menu, glass of water or any awareness that I was there. Indeed other folks on the five tables outside also seemed rather confused (this is a tourist area).Once I did get service, the waitress had a serious attitude - as if I had somehow inconvenienced her somehow. Seriously....she&#39;s a waitress...that&#39;s her job. Even better if she has a smile on her face. But no...By the time I got the check, I just wanted to get out of there.To the management of Mario&#39;s: Your service is getting worse. I for one won&#39;t be back, and judging from some other reviews, the hipster attitude is alienating your regular customers. Believe me...when the tourists leave, its the locals who keep your restaurant in business.Shame....but there are too many other places to get coffee and a sandwich who make your feel welcome.

BEST TUNA MELT IN THE WORLD....Seriously, no joke....I have been eating here for over 25 years (since I was just a little girl, getting my first hair cut next door).Served open-faced on freshly baked focaccia bread, with swiss cheese and white onions, then cut into &#34;fingers&#34; about 1 inch by 3 inches that perfectly mold (and melt) in your mouth.I have taken countless other people to Mario&#39;s and everyone agrees.....best tuna melt EVER...hands down...Priced around $12, its not the cheapest tuna melt around, but its worth every penny

You can&#39;t beat the adorable atmosphere with rickety wooden tables and a view of the park. Get the chicken sandwich (add tomatoes if you like). Their mustard has a delicious kick to it - watch out if you&#39;re a little sensitive to horseradish-esque tastes, but it&#39;s SO GOOD! Cheap carafes of wine as well. It&#39;s not the most amazing, droolworthy, tell everyone you see meal in North Beach, but sometimes you just want to grab a leisurely sandwich in a really comfortable, cute, pleasant atmosphere. Go!!! Perfect weekend afternoon stop.

Great atmosphere for an impressive (and AFFORDABLE) dinner with friends. Came based on Yelp reviews. I would come back in a heartbeat.FOOD/BEER: Mouth-watering. Ordered a pitcher of their summer special beer, a stout that tasted amazing. They&#39;re famous for their foccacia, so I ordered an eggplant foccacia that came out steaming hot and smelling seductive.Went to Gelateria Naia next door for delicious dessert to top off the evening!SERVICE: Meh, nothing to complain about. Waitress mostly stayed out of our way but checked in on us; I was hoping for a homey, mom-and-pop manager with whom my friend could practice his Italian, but the waitress didn&#39;t seem friendly or Italian.

Love this place!! I woke up this Saturday with no real plans for the morning/early afternoon and wandered to Marios for a cup of coffee and a foccacia sandwich. Reading the newspaper while eating the #2 grilled chicken sandwich (request it open faced!) was the best way to spend this relaxing, sunny Saturday.Mario has a very attentive staff and great food, although I found myself walking past it for several months before walking in and trying it out. It isn&#39;t ideal for large groups, but a great place for intimate coffee or brunch/lunch time w/ friends. The ideal seating would be the front table away from the draft that comes from opening and closing the door.Again, I recommend the coffee, espresso (strong!) and grilled chicken sandwich open faced. The caprese salad would be more delightful sans the pesto sauce but other than that, I&#39;ve heard good things about their other sandwich and panini options.

Mario&#39;s is fantastic! For the longest time, I thought they only served coffees. Then I realized they also served beer and wine. Then I realized that they also serve some of the best sandwiches in San Francisco...!The foccacia sandwiches which range from about $7.75 to $9.50 are huge and amazing! I was particularly impressed with chicken #1 and the tuna sandwich but the grilled eggplant and grilled veggies were good too.The panini sandwiches are a bit smaller and about $1 less and still great! The salads are also very fresh and I&#39;ve heard that the pizza&#39;s are yummy.The cappuccinos that I&#39;ve had have been very good but the straight coffee&#39;s that I&#39;ve ordered have been not as good... In terms of other beverages, they have lots of great wine starting at about $5 a glass (Dad complained that they weren&#39;t using &#34;real&#34; wine glasses outside... more like mini water glasses but I think he may have gotten a bigger pour than a wine glass!).We stalked a group that were finishing their lunch and then grabbed their great table out in the sun. There aren&#39;t enough outside tables but it&#39;s great when you can get one!I&#39;ve also done take-out for dinner and their sandwiches maintain their amazing quality as they travel in perfect little cardboard boxes where they can&#39;t get squished!

This isn&#39;t &#34;fancy&#34; Italian food. But it&#39;s honest and satisfying. My favorite is their lasagna, an unpretentious mix of noodles, rich tomato sauce, goopy mozzeralla cheese, and ground beef. Salty, fatty, meaty goodness. Sometimes, when I&#39;m elsewhere eating fancy lasagna, I wish it were this.The space is small and cozy and has nice views of the nearby church and park. It&#39;s a great place to read a book and sip some wine.

Ok so I had one day in San Fransisco and decided to try out this place and I&#39;m so glad I did.It&#39;s a small place. 10 people can sit at the bar and there are about 10 tables.There is no back kitchen. If you&#39;re sitting at the bar, you can watch them make your food. Right behind the counter is where they prep everything in a big fire oven.When you ask for a sub, that&#39;s when they throw in the dough in their oven and the break bakes right then and there.We tried the meatball sandwich and it&#39;s one of the best I&#39;ve had (and I have tried maaaany meatball subs) and the grilled chicken salad. Both greaaaaat.The cakes sitting at the counter were hard to resist but i somehow did.Having said that... I&#39;m taking a star off because the staff can be a bit moody (not rude..just kinda cranky) and slow at times. I waited 10 minutes to see if they will ever refill my coffee (i was sitting right across from 2 workers at the bar) and then gave up and asked for it. I didn&#39;t mind their personalities it as much as someone else might.

I enjoyed my recent trip to the Bohemian Cigar Store this past weekend. The restaurant/bar/cafe is pretty small, but not too claustrophobic, and I found the service to be friendly and attentive. I ordered the oven roasted chicken sandwich #2, with tomato and feta, and thought it was pretty delicious. My only complaint is that for the price I would&#39;ve appreciate some fries, chips, etc. any side accompaniment, because while the sandwich was good, it didn&#39;t completely fill me up. This is a minor complaint though, because I plan to return in the future when I&#39;m in North Beach.

What a fantastic little place! Great service, super food and drinks, and so affordable. My friend and I split the spicy tuna foccacia and prosciutto baguette (both daily specials and FANTASTIC), hummingbird IPAs, and coffee drinks and got out of there for less than $20 each. Our server was even kind enough to give us public transportation directions to our next location on the back of a napkin. The other server even gave us some gum after our strange combination of food and drink - much appreciated!

The lasagna was greasy, the glasses were dirty, and the wine list consisted of &#34;cab&#34; or &#34;merlot&#34;I think we ordered the meatball sandwich too, but it was so uneventful I don&#39;t really remember if it was &#34;ok&#34; or &#39;&#39;good&#34;, but it certainly wasn&#39;t great or memorable.I wanted to like it, the location is great, but the actual quality of food and beverage was low.I suppose if you want to grab a beer and sit at a bar in a prime location it&#39;s good. I was terribly unimpressed :(

I&#39;ve passed by this place a bunch of times and finally stopped in for a quick bite before lounging in the park. I walked right in and started chatting with the guy behind the bar/kitchen that was making sandwiches and pizzas. Found out they do take out so I ordered up a chicken panini and coffee and continued chatting. The space is super cozy and had I not wanted to soak up some sun, I probably would have stayed to eat my sandwich there.The sandwich itself wasn&#39;t anything spectacular. It wasn&#39;t bad, it wasn&#39;t excellent...just meh. I did see a plate of sausage and polenta that got me drooling, so maybe I&#39;ll just go back and sample that? Yes.Also, I asked for a coffee and they offered me an americano instead. I mean, yeah, I get it. Same concept, but I feel like I ended up spending more money.

The sandwich, #1 Chicken, was very good. The bread was soft unlike most places and there was a lot of melted cheese. Overall, very good.My problem with the place and the reaosn why I wont return is the price. To spend nearly $13 with tip on just a sandwich is just too much considering the prices at Dimaggios a couple doors down arent much different for a sandwich. I would at least expect some chips or something on the side. And, no, I dont count the two jalopenos they give as a side item.

I just visited for 4 hours last night with a colleague/friend...and found this to be a charming little spot. Love it! The place is pretty cozy and feels like your own personal cafe when you walk in....very friendly, familiar, charming...Simple menu which is awesome---simple wine list, again, no problem. I don&#39;t do or need fancy-shmancy. My friend told me try either the tuna, sausage, meatball or eggplant panini....now I usually delve into meat options but I&#39;m a huge fan of eggplant so I opted for that and an unlimited amount of Malbec.... SO GOOD! The bread...incredible, the flavors in the eggplant, wow, hearty.... I tried his tuna.... SO GOOD! WIN!***note, the amount of Malbec had no influence whatsoever on the rating of the food, promise!***The server was a really nice character who poured our last glass on the house.... don&#39;t know if that meant he was really being gratuitous or if it was because we almost finished the bottle... :) Who cares! It was great.And the neighborhood is a gem to walk around after... apparently there is a great gelato spot nearby... possibly my next review??

I used to come here when you were still allowed to smoke cigarettesin this place. Most of the time we had tasty ciabatta at lunch or in the evening here, overlooking the square. Marios is a cosy place with character, history and patina.I stopped by recently and was glad the place still existed. In general I felt Northbeach is stuck in time and has not moved on in the last decades.Parking the rental car was a pain.

The meatball focaccia is very good - but had to wait 45 minutes to get it. As soon as we got our food, we took it to go as paying $4 / hr for parking just doesn&#39;t warrant me sitting around waiting for food for that long.No one said - your food will be about 30-40 minutes.

It took a while as my order was briefly lost in the shuffle, but when my open-faced veggie sandwich finally arrived, it was so worth the wait. This calorie depleted yelper, who was just a few hours removed from a 4+ hour epic with Markus Schulz, went right to work.This focaccia-grilled veggies-marinara sauce creation stood no chance, and as I reflected on last night&#39;s show, already being referred to in the text/Facebook world as &#34;best night ever&#34;, I found the sandwich enhancing my mood even more.Brilliant weekend. Brilliant sandwich.

Mario&#39;s is a great neighborhood cafe. I love stopping by this place for a cappuccino/beer/panini/whatever. I&#39;m not a huge panini fan, but I come here for their paninis. Service is friendly, even though it&#39;s a small place you won&#39;t feel rushed out if you want to sit there and read for a bit. I like how even though it&#39;s in a touristy area, it does&#39;t feel touristy. No complaints at all.

3 stars...because it&#39;s very clean, in a GREAT location, the courteous staff, and amazing foccacia bread.However, after being told that the meatball sandwich was their &#34;claim to fame&#34;, I was very disappointed.. while the foccacia itself was the BEST I have ever eaten (light and airy and toasted to perfection), the &#34;meatballs&#34; were entirely tasteless.The unappealing, gray-colored SLICES (not &#34;balls&#34;) of meat had absolutely no flavor whatsoever. The melted cheese and the perfectly toasted foccacia bread was excellent, but without any flavorful meat, it was a complete failure (as a sandwich)....and sadly so..I wanted to enjoy what my server said was their best.I will return, because of the pro&#39;s I specified above, but I won&#39;t have any high expectations about the food.

Decent sandwich - I had the grilled chicken #1 - the foccacia was perfect and good enough to eat by itself. I was dissapointed it didn&#39;t come with any sides - fries would&#39;ve been nice or even a bag of chips. It did come with pepperoncinis which I absolutely love. They got gobbled up before I even started on the sandwich.The establishment is quite small so if it&#39;s just you and a friend you&#39;ll be fine but anymore than that and space will become a premium.I hear the meatball sandwich is crazy good.

When you come to North Beach...you usually have 2 things on your mind...1) girls 2) itallian food. Well this place offers up some THE BEST Italian Panini Sandwiches you will find in SF.Let&#39;s start off with the bread...onion focaccia bread, because as we all know it&#39;s the bread that makes the sandwich. Perfectly toasted, flavor pops in your mouth.All their sandwiches are amazing...but their sausage panini...soooooo good.I ended up ordering the cannelloni...which was AMAZING! Their mix of spinach, cheese, veal, and chicken in a marinara sauce...wow...too bad they only give u 2 :(. I was still hungry so I ordered up a sandwich...best choice I&#39;ve made in my life.DEFINITELY RECOMMEND COMING HERE!!!

I&#39;m no italian, but I definitely know the difference between your typical tourist trap italian restaurant on Columbus and the real deal meal-ios. These guys are definitely legit. The owner always greets my roommates and I with a smile and a ready, eager hand to cook.This place has a neighborly feel to it more than any place I&#39;ve tried in North Beach. Definitely going to recommend it. Oh, and do they actually sell cigars?? Cause I&#39;m not seeing it!

Mmmmm, almost $10 for a sandwich? Alone? With nary a side to be seen? (Well, there MIGHT have been a pickle. I don&#39;t recall, to be honest.) The frugal diner should steer clear. Also, the Frommer&#39;s-toting traveler who&#39;s not from Lilliput. My guide suggested that the BCSC&#39;s &#34;large&#34; sandwiches were best enjoyed across the street in the park, but I chose to stay indoors and close to the counter, lest my far-from ample meal attract the gaze and titters of passersby. That, and it was dark out. And possibly raining.At least the ladies working the counter were a hoot.

on a crisp cold afternoon we (mostly meaning I) was starvin and looking what would crave my hunger. my boss had told me to try this out, so the bf and I headed on over. love the feel in the place; comfortable, homey, and right across the park for some good dog watching :)we split the caesar salad- romaine fresh and crunchy, croutons were just perfect, shaved parm, and the dressing, although lightly dressed, was absolutely delicious. tasted just like our homemade version.for the main parts- i got the meatball sandwich, him - the salami panini. i really enjoyed the marinara and the meatballs. they were fluffier, probably had a good amount of bread in them. the bread on both sandwiches were just awesomeness, asked the server and told us they get it from Bakers of Paris. his salami panini had that meaty slightly spicy thing going for it. pretty good prices too.

I was so excited to try their famous meatball sandwich and then the day my friend and I went, I had had meat lasagna the night before and the meatball sandwich just didn&#39;t sound good. So I decided to go with one of their sausage sandwiches. Overall, I think both my friend and I enjoyed our sandwiches (she got the half meatball so it was open-faced), but maybe it&#39;s just a preference, this wouldn&#39;t top my list of best sandwiches and I&#39;m not hurrying to go back. The panini was really crispy and the sausage was good, but wouldn&#39;t be my top pick as far as flavors. I asked for some crushed red pepper and that helped.Service was good, we went in on a weekday and they were pretty quiet. My friend wanted a diet coke but they only have specialty sodas, he brought her one to taste, but she didn&#39;t care for it, it was no problem, they didn&#39;t charge us for it. He checked in on us constantly as well.I&#39;d recommend anyone to try this place, it&#39;s definitely a solid sandwich, just wouldn&#39;t be the top of my list.

It&#39;s not even cheesecake. It&#39;s light and fluffy and an enormous piece of heaven. The wife of the owner couple makes this at home. Mm. I am thinking of heading over there later today just to get me some of that.And... their sandwiches are amazing - no fuss, simple is better, high quality ingredients. The perfect place to spend a lazy few hours.

I love this place. Just a tiny bar at the corner of Columbus and Union that happens to serve kickass sandwiches and Moretti in a bottle. Ended up stranded here last week when it started pouring rain and i was without umbrella. Mario&#39;s is not a bad place to be stuck inside.I must note that i have never purchased a cigar here, nor ever even seen a cigar here. I&#39;m sure they are somewhere. I guess i have have a reason to go back.

Mario&#39;s is a great neighborhood spot if you want a simple place to get affordable food and drinks and be able to talk. Doesn&#39;t sound like much to ask for, but these things are at a premium in this area.The location is just far enough away from all the shit hole tourist traps with neon signs down the street so there&#39;s no real spillover. Every seat is a window seat and the people watching is great with the park right across the street.If you&#39;re a guy over 4ft tall and have had a few Peronis, have fun trying to use the bathroom.

Give me the sun in washington square and a Chicken #2 sammy and I&#39;m happy. as long as the chicken is cooked right. I give Mario&#39;s 3 only, only because the quality of food can be hit or miss. At times the food can be over cooked, dry etc. Pizzas included, and other times, i&#39;d say the majority, the food is killer and its a great addition to a day is washington square.

I was going to say I was unimpressed with the size of the panini sandwich. But then I did some research and found out panini is the plural of panino which translates to &#34;small bread&#34;. So egg on my face.So instead I&#39;ll say the panini is good and I am really anxious to try some of the bigger varieties of sandwiches. A panini is more a snack you and a friend would share as you take advantage of the beers on tap.But the real draw is the Americano. So far the best I have had in SF. I know it is just espresso and hot water, but beyond Starbucks it&#39;s tough to find good ones and Mario&#39;s Americano is great.I just love the fact you can get an espresso drink and a biscotti or other dessert or load up on carbs with beer and Italian food. Or both in the same day if you plan it right (one of these days).And the location right on Washington Square is unbeatable. Considering 90% of Columbus Ave is tourist traps, Mario&#39;s is a must see European style cafe, even down to the slow service. But hey, why are you in a hurry in North Beach?

it pains me to blast marios with a 1 star review because their food is good but....Last time i ate there i ordered a chicken panini to go and while i waited for the guy to make it I watched him (with one glove on) sweep the floor, put his hand in the trash, touch multiple other dirty surface&#39;s with both hands then proceed to handle my sandwich and garnishes with unwashed hands with one glove still on. I dont mind cleaning up while you wait. but for f@cks sake wash your hands and put on clean gloves before you handle someones food. Especially if they are standing right there watching you the whole time. Based on this one experience I unfortunately will never return to this establishment.

I have been sitting on this review for awhile, agonizing if I was going to give it 4 or 5 stars. And then it hit me: The focaccia sandwiche(s) that I have had here has become the end-all be-all sandwich to which I compare all other sandwiches.In the last couple of weeks, every time I eat a sandwich (which seems to be fairly frequently at the moment), I catch myself saying, &#34;It&#39;s good, but it&#39;s not as good as Mario&#39;s.&#34; It has set the upper limit of my sandwich scale. If that&#39;s not reason enough to give this place 5 stars, I don&#39;t know what is.Not surprisingly, I think the secret is the bread itself - perfectly crunchy but still soft. If you want something that can only be ironically described as &#34;health,&#34; I suggest the salami/ham sandwich.To. Die. For.The service is a little...strange. They are nice and try to be funny, but come off as just a little awkward. It&#39;s really hard for me to put my finger on it, as they are attentive and not rude, but just...different.Bottom line, even if the service was the most horrendous thing in the history of the world, the sandwiches would make up for it x20. Definitely a must when in Northbeach.

This place reminds me of the cafe&#39;s they have in Europe. It&#39;s a one-stop shop for all your indulgent needs. Need a drink but also a hot meal? Done. Need a drink but can&#39;t unless you get a smoke? Done. Need espresso and a quick pastry? Done. Need all of the above? Done and done.I have yet to have the food here but the panini&#39;s looked amazing. The wine selection is not great so don&#39;t come here thinking you&#39;re going to get Amelie style wines (not that you would - I hope!). Next time I&#39;ll stick with beer; you can never go wrong with a Stella.I also want to note the generosity of the bartender who gave us a round for free towards the end of the night. Good shiz.

I always say that I never give out 5 stars unless I am willing to call someone and tell them about a place. This is one of those places.I love Mario&#39;s because of it&#39;s authenticity and its history. The place has been around for many many decades and you can tell. They have amazing sandwiches (esp the chicken focaccia). They also have good selection of wines and their cappuccino&#39;s are excellent.Above all else, it&#39;s a neighborhood spot. I love going in and sitting in the corner table and writing for hours. During the day you can people watch as they walk through North Beach or play in Washington Square park. The people who work there are all very interesting and great conversationalists. Almost as an art form. On nice weekend days, they open doors on both sides of the establishment to get a great cross breeze and an influx of neighborhood characters.CLINCHER - They play the best music. I discovered Calexico here - one of my favorite bandsONLY COMPLAINT - no wi-fi... then again, what restaurant/bar does right? Bad for turnover I guess

Best sandwich ever!Ever!Yes, it&#39;s really that good. Try their foccacia sandwiches, you&#39;ll be back again, and again for them. I go here about once a week. This place is my go to spot for chilling at a restaurant near the park, people watching, good sandwich eating, and having a great meal for a reasonable price. Don&#39;t expect the severs to wait on you hand and foot, but the service isn&#39;t bad either. They&#39;ll get your food and drinks to you in a reasonable amount of time, but since the place is so small they will probably be busy. You might have to wait to get a table if you come on a weekend, but if you&#39;re looking for an amazing sandwich, do yourself a favor and wait it out. It&#39;ll be worth it :)

I ordered a combo sandwich and an anchor steam. The guy taking my order immediately said &#34;some guys have been coming in here and ordering that or 20 years&#34;. Good to know, I was a little concerned that I would not make it out of here alive after eating it. I am not saying this because it was bad, because it was not, it was delicious. I mean really delicious!! ...but it was all meat, cheese, and mayo on a very oily (but also delicious) focaccia roll.The people here were a mix of regulars and tourists. I had a good time listening to some visitors and the staff talking about the appropriate maximum amount of time to keep ground coffee beans.They have Peroni to go along with your italian meal but if you are not into that sort of thing your only real other option is anchor steam. The rest of the beers are mostly the boring blue moon type stuff.Finally, Thanks for the great service. I sat at the bar and was always being taken care of. The staff obviously is intent on keeping this place the classic that it is.I am going to try the Cannelloni next time...

This is a cool and cozy place to get something to eat and drink in a fun location with great people watching across from Washington Square park. The food is simple, but really tasty and satisfying. The meatball sandwich is great, and my personal favorite is the lasagna (which I am always a sucker for, no matter where I am). Every time I get Mario&#39;s lasagna, I am presented with a bubbling dish of gooey, cheesy, meaty, tomatoey goodness. Again, it&#39;s all pretty simple stuff, but it really hits the spot. Add to that a beer or glass of wine with a view of the (hilarious, in my opinion) segway tours that often pass by outside, and you&#39;ve got it made.

Man, that oniony foccacia bread is heavenly. I think I&#39;d be happy if it were just a little toasted with big bowl of fruity olive oil. I&#39;ve tried one of the chicken sandwiches and the meatball one and I prefer the latter. I&#39;d say it&#39;s not a typical meatball sandwich though - it&#39;s most of a deconstructed meatball slash sausage sandwich. In any event, it&#39;s pretty good. (Sounds like the eggplant one should be next based on the other reviews...)I like the relaxed vibe of the of place - the bartender/server guy was super friendly both times I dropped in. It&#39;s nice to know there&#39;s a mellow place to get a bite when you&#39;re too hungover to deal with anything that&#39;s remotely uncasual.

I only had 30 minutes until my open house started so I should&#39;ve ordered a salad but the hot sandwiches everyone else was eating looked way too good so I ordered a turkey sandwich with melted cheese and dijon mustard and a beer. The beer took 5 to 7 minutes and the sandwich 12 to 15 minutes even though it was not that busy. Is this too long? Not if your hanging out with friends, but it seems like forever when your eyeing the clock. The beer (Anchor Steam) was good as always, the sandwich was out of this world! Too bad I didn&#39;t get a napkin (I was served by the cook who was a little flighty, he should stick to the cooking).If your in North Beach and want a hot sandwich and a beer and don&#39;t mind paying $20 a person with tip you owe your self a trip to this great cafe!

Close to work and home I gave it a try today. Ordered a chicken panini to go. As I was waiting I saw these big, delicious, beautiful sandwiches being served so I was really excited to try mine. It didn&#39;t take very long to make and I was handed a box. When I got back to work and opened the box I was surprised to see a very small chicken panini. For $10 I thought it was going to be bigger and it didn&#39;t look like anything like what was being served. I guess what I saw was the focaccia sandwich. Aside from the size, the chicken panini was absolutely delicious!! I can say that I will return for it and maybe get a salad for a side if I&#39;m really hungry. Service was without a smile but I noticed they are a little nicer to regulars. Taking the good with the bad, I don&#39;t doubt I will return...ya, it was that good. =)

Apparently I had a cigar theme last night. Ducked in here while waiting for our table at the pizza place around the corner. Super chill vibe, and the bartender even juggled the oranges before slipping them into the blue moon.Grabbed a nice table outside, and watched the parking on the street and everyone taking photos of the park at night. ?I think that I just don&#39;t understand this part of town sometimes.

This is a great and affordable spot to grab a sandwich in northbeach. It is one of the few places where you can find a meal for under $10 and they also have a pretty affordable wine list. Mario&#39;s is also located on the corner of Columbus right next to the park, which can be amazing for people watching.

Despite the enticing aroma of garlic and sauces all hereabouts, I normally run screaming from any food establishment in North Beach. I&#39;ve only had bland meals with fine-dining prices in this part of town, so I tend to leave Steps of Rome and their ilk to the tourists.But Mario&#39;s has me wondering whether I&#39;ve been a bit hasty.Similar to Cafe Francisco a few blocks up, Mario&#39;s is good for a quality lunch. Also like Cafe Francisco, it&#39;s a wee bit expensive (in the $10 range), but they do have table service. I came with a co-worker, and we both had paninis, mine with chicken and avocado and the right amount of cheese. The sandwiches are on the small side, but I usually try to avoid food-coma-inducing lunches anyway.Cozy interior, cute decor, be-Diesel-ed staff (maybe they&#39;re all actually Italian?), and a view of Washington Square Park to go with the meal ain&#39;t so bad at all.Oh, and I don&#39;t know if they actually have cigars, but I don&#39;t think those would go well with panini.

Have been coming here every time that I visit SF since 1991. We last weekend (Jan. 10) - order the same meatball sandwich every time and love it every time.A few years, ago, my wife and I went, sat at the bar and someone put on a full James Brown record. Marios - meatball sandwich, great coffee and James Brown! We always talk about that experience.Staff is very nice; food the best (at a reasonable rate) - a trip to SF is never complete until we go to Marios!

North Beach is full of false havens but this place is legit- a pearl. The grilled foccacia sandos are unreal in their deliciousness. I can&#39;t say I have had it done better EVER. The lasagna is very good as well. The space is utterly classic and brimming with character without being kitschy or... well... dirty. It&#39;s a great place for a casual evening dinner that really knocks it out of the park with how tasty everything is. I also believe the owner does all the service so he is of course very attentive and wants to keep you happy which he does with ease. This will now be my go-to place to eat in North Beach.

I&#39;ve eaten here a few times and I&#39;ve always had a great experience. The restaurant has a great location, open and close to plenty of shopping, historical landmarks and a beautiful park.The sandwiches are absolutely delicious and well priced and the service is always great (although sometimes a little slow). The only negative I have to say about this place is that the seating is limited and a little cramped, it can be hard to find a table, or sometimes even move around.

Best. Lasagna. EVER.Bohemian, yes... Cigars, not so much. Which is great news, because instead they have delicious food!I personally ordered the grilled eggplant panini, which was incredible, but the lasagna was actually the best of its kind that I&#39;ve tried yet. The carafe of red wine and the sunny day certainly helped, although it did get a touch cold on the terrace because the sun wasn&#39;t directly hitting it. Despite the homeless serenader and the nippiness, however, it was a fabulous way to spend a lovely President&#39;s Day and be outside after such a long week of rain. Our server slash bartender was friendly, in a quirky hipster kind of way, and the prices were the usual North Beach standard... which, in this case, were absolutely worth it. Very quaint, right next to Washington Square Park, and great for people-watching without being right slap in the middle of the chaos. Even the bizarre restroom set-up seemed strangely enchanting after such a scrumptious meal and charming experience!

This is a great place to eat lunch or take it out and eat it in Washington Square Park (on one of the few days San Francisco is nice to you and the sun shines).I will order anything with the dijon mustard on it and Chicken #1 and the meatball sandwiches are my favorites! It takes awhile for them to make your sandwich (about 10 minutes if they&#39;re not that busy), but it&#39;s worth the wait. The foccacia bread they put the sandwich on is so good.The cheesecake was kind of a disappointment though. It kind of tasted like thick egg bread and wasn&#39;t what I expected at all.

At first when I was told to meet for lunch at the &#34;Cigar Store&#34; I was a little thrown. Upon my groups hungry arrival the staff was really friendly and helped us be the (annoying people with the big group) that needed to gather more chairs.The Hot Foccacia Sandwiches are amazing and served really piping hot. From what I could gather they cook them right behind the bar on what seems to be a small pannini press. The ingredients were fresh and the group consensus was to come back.Seating: The table at the front window overlooks the streets and Jackson Park which is fun to watch. Grab it if it is free. There are also tables outside so if it is a nice day opt to sit there and watch the tourists wonder by.

On a whim, or rather, on a bit of Yelp research, I discovered Mario&#39;s.Yelp again succeeds- the eggplant foccacia sandwich not only made me solidify my position on eggplant in the positive. I found myself searching the plate for any dropped crumbs of this sandwich that I could find after devouring it.It&#39;s a bit pricey for sandwiches, but not too pricey for awesome sandwiches.

Driving around the city looking for a place open at 3pm for food! HUNGRY!! Ended up walking around Northbeach and walked right into this place seeing that it was crowded, must be good right? The staff was very nice, young guys hype and charming, mocha came out mmm it was good but could be a tad hotter. Ordered the meatball hot sandwich and caprese salad. The pesto on the Caprese salad was to die for! Soaked up every last drop with extra bread! The sammys took an hour to come out! YES an HOUR! man lucky the staff was real nice or I would of bitten their arms off I was so hungry! The sammy was yummy. Goey cheese, good meatballs and delicious focacia bread with green onions Oh my ! I would go back just for that focacia. I had a quarter of my friend&#39;s eggplant sammy and it was just OK, it was too salty for me. I love eggplant sammys, I&#39;ve had better. It was good, if I lived in the hood I would be there alot. Since I&#39;m not at NB too often I don&#39;t know when I&#39;ll be back.

I got my karmic payback for making light of herpes the other day.You see, shortly after making fun of the social disease, I sprouted a pimple on the inside of my lip, and anyone who&#39;s ever had any sort of blemish or bump or whatever inside their mouth knows that they can hurt like a bitch!So it was without thinking of this ailment that I bit into a pepperocini while at Mario&#39;s. OH GOD DAMMIT TO HELL THAT BURNS! I shoved the generous portion of the offending pickled peppers to the side of my plate.I took a bite of my heapingly huge foccacia sandwich (your choice of fillings: chicken, eggplant, sausage, you name it!) as the crusty corner of the deliciously perfect foccacia brushed against my lip-pimple. OWW! OH GOD, OK, I WON&#39;T MAKE JOKES ABOUT PEOPLE&#39;S LIP &amp; COOCHIE SORES ANYMORE. AND I WON&#39;T USE YOUR NAME IN VAIN. PLEASE, JUST MAKE IT STOP.But it was so good, I continued to eat.Thank you, Mario, for serving up delicious food, a very cozy and homey atmosphere, and lessons in karmic retribution and humility before god.Note to those confused by the name of the business: The food is not Bohemian in any way, and while cigars are sold, they cannot be smoked here. If anything, it&#39;s more of a casual Italian restaurant and wine bar with a dark, homey atmosphere that could&#39;ve once been a den of cigar-smoking and backroom deal-making.

Food was okay for the most part. Salads were sad but the meatball sandwhich was great.Service was awful. Our waiter was incredibly rude, sarcastic and arrogant. That, along with the long wait for the food and the bill, made the whole experience a nightmare.After we finished the meal and asked for the bill we waited over a half an hour and eventually had to ask the waitress to remind our waiter because no one in our group even wanted to talk to him at that point.As good as that sandwhich was the service was so bad there is no way i would ever go back.

Ages ago a friend took me there and recommended the eggplant parmesan focaccia sandwich. It was so good that I&#39;ve never been able to order anything else. About once a week (or more) I get this undeniable craving and HAVE to go. It&#39;s wonderful.In addition I like the environment. It&#39;s never too crowded, the people working there are really mellow and friendly and it&#39;s got this nice patina of age. If their sandwich wasn&#39;t sublime, I&#39;d probably still go there sometimes for a drink. But I&#39;m glad that their sandwich exists.

Stumbled upon this place at about 2 on a Monday afternoon while looking for a quick and yummy bite after visiting Alcatraz and climbing way up to Coit Tower. It was the perfect spot to plop down and kick back and relax for a few and, upon walking in, you could tell it was a neighborhood classic.The staff was super-friendly. When my girlfriend inquired about their Sabu Bloody Mary they told her it wasn&#39;t very good - honesty is the best policy, right? Instead, we ordered a couple Anchor Steams and waited for our food. The bathroom was unique but clean and funny to use.I ordered the smoked turkey hot focaccia sandwich which was perfectly grilled and delicious. It was served with a great cucumber salad and pickle. My girlfriend ordered the eggplant pizza which was delicious as well (although the crust seemed oddly similar to frozen pizza crust).Prices were fairly good, although on the high end but the personality the place has totally made up for it. Overall, loved it!!

Cheaper and more reliable than the string of overpriced tourist-centered Italian cafes down the block. This place is cozy without the overly-friendly waiters that I find to be overbearing in most of North Beach.Good lunch spot for panini, focaccia sandwiches (breaded eggplant!), cannelloni and lasagna. Go at off-times (like 2pm for lunch) since table seating is sparse and this place tends to fill up.

I am not into cigars or bars, but someone introduced me to Mario&#39;s long, long ago, and I have been a fan ever since. Consider this great comfort food. I am a fan of the hot foccacia sandwiches. I&#39;ve had veggie and breaded eggplant. I get one or the other and have been for the last twelve years. Sometimes I think of trying something else, but I am worried the eggplant will miss me. On my last visit, I sat at the counter for the first time (usually I&#39;m at the small table in back) and enjoyed watching the food being made. Kudos to the sandwich makers!

This place is a cool little spot. Not too big and every table including the bar area was full. I took a peak at the drink menu and both beer and wine were very cheap.

Note: no cigars or related found here. Sorry, cigar aficionados.Ambiance:Small and cozy, about 4-5 tables for three, with a bar. Quaint dark wood interior, and a split door entrance with character. Everyone is guaranteed a view of lovely green Washington Square, which is directly across the street. Depending on who is manning the CD carousel, you&#39;ll be listening to soothing bossa nova, new age world music, or lively Spanish salsa. Loud but not too loud for table conversation.Seems to be a quiet choice for active, 20s and 30s North Beach locals who happen to be in the vicinity. Not one tourist to be seen.Only one bathroom. It&#39;s in the back, as large as an airplane restroom, without the mirror. Seems almost like it was installed as an afterthought.Drink:Kinda on the small portion size for the money, but hey, it&#39;s North Beach. Tea options are nothing exotic and quite limited (about 5 choices of bagged supermarket-grade tea), while coffees are standard fare. They do better by their coffee. Of course, they also have beers, many in bottles and about 3 on tap - I&#39;m personally happy to find Italian beers here, even if only in bottles.Food:The desserts are a bit disappointing. Their tiramisu and ricotta cheesecake are the only ones homemade there. The cheesecake tasted nothing of cheese, strongly resembling angel food cake in taste, look and texture. The lower half of the cheesecake was some sort of egg custard. Better to go with a meal order, as that is where their strength lies.Service:Good and friendly. The staff is youthful, calm, all smiles and happy to give recommendations and answers.

Lovely little cafe overlooking Washington Square. From the comfort of your seat, while sipping delectable hot chocolate, you can see the bronzed yoga man in nothing but shorts on a cold day, dog walkers pretending not to notice when their dog takes a shit, and random children playing (not sure I knew children actually existed in this city)Good food, interesting people watching, and a nice respite from the usually touristy North Beach.Note: Not actually a cigar store. Don&#39;t go in here thinking you&#39;ll pick up some Cubans on the down low. Not gonna happen.

I&#39;ve lived in S.F. for over 20yrs and would come here at least once a month. I moved away but still have to stop by here every time I visit my family to get my meatball sando fix. Bar None the best meatball Sandwich ever. I sit at the bar, order an Anchor Steam and feel like I never left. The staff is great, they remember me and address me by name, which is amazing.

Went back to Mario&#39;s and am happy to report that it&#39;s still awesome. I have yet to find better foccacia bread in the city and forgot to mention my delight over the peppercinis that come with each sandwich. Delicious. I also enjoy the camaraderie between the staff members. Love this place!

The sandwiches and pizza are pretty effin great.I even saw the bartender carefully take down a poster from the wall and give it to a customer because the customer liked it.Deliciously San Franciscan.

Best focaccia sandwich ever, hands down. I go with the meatball every time. Also, best cappuccino in the city. I&#39;ve been going here as long as I can remember, and have only ever had amazing things to say about it. Everyone I bring here can&#39;t stop thanking me for introducing them, &#39;nuff said. Friendly service, AMAZING food, reasonable price, good music, good atmosphere. Did I miss anything?

This has been my favorite hangout in the world since my first visit in 1973, the year the Crismani family took over the former &#34;Bohemian Cigar Store&#34; (which really did sell cigars), and i arrived in NB. it had been one of the several &#34;Italian old men&#34; coffee/wine bars in North Beach. they were all gone by the late &#39;70&#39;s, the Portofino (where Cafe Roma is today) and others i can&#39;t remember the names. within months Mario kicked out all the old guys, took out their old Italian pinball machines, and completely shifted the customership to all us 20-somethings who were flooding into San Francisco and NB in the 70&#39;s, plus its many continuing beat-era denizens. very smart business plan, betting on the future. there were no windows on the Union Street side at all, those were added in the 80&#39;s. Mario kept a box of cigars under the counter to sell just in case someone wandered in and asked for one until he passed away in the 90&#39;s. at some point around then they had to take out the Foosball game in the back to add more tables because the landlord raised the rent a lot, also adding the sidewalk tables outside. but aside from such details it really hasn&#39;t changed at all. they have had the good sense not to redecorate or try to update. it still has one of the funkiest (but clean) bathrooms in town. Lilliana still bakes the pastries, the sandwhiches are tasty, and the servers are always very neighborhood-y. the generations of customers, servers, and passers-by shift with the years, but the place is timeless.just thought i&#39;d offer some history for context.

Chicken foccacia sandwiches. There are two on the menu and they&#39;re both delicious. Get one of those and an Anchor Steam beer. Pick up a Chronicle from the corner (the crossword puzzle will be done but that&#39;s ok). Grab a table by the window overlooking Washington Square park. Get another Anchor Steam. You, my friend, are having the best lunch in the City.

Get the eggplant sandwich, the breaded one. My friends &amp; I have been going here for, holy crap, almost 20 yrs just for that. Grab a table looking out on Washington Square.Then maybe walk up Columbus for some truffles from XOX. A good place to meet friends for lunch on a rainy day. Or a sunny day. Or a non-sunny night.

The panini here are fantastic. It&#39;s the perfect spot for a quick lunch or dinner. But let&#39;s be honest. There&#39;s a lot of other reasons they get 4 stars: the name, the view of Washington Square, Moretti Rosso in a bottle, the old North Beach bar. You can&#39;t go wrong at Mario&#39;s.

Solid. My favorite is the breaded eggplant sandwich with a glass of house red. Great place to meet up wtih friends for a quick bite before hitting the town. Cappucinos are tasty, too. Hits the spot on a sunny day, if you can get a window seat. The service used to be better a few years ago. Not sure the deal there. Could just be cluelessness or a decision by the staff to treat locals like passing tourists.

The lasagna here is the ultimate winter comfort food. Mario&#39;s is very cozy, with an old-fashioned San Francisco atmosphere. It&#39;s a good place for dates ... my parents had their first date here in the early 80s, and it&#39;s where I take a guy I&#39;m seeing if I think he&#39;s really special. If the weather is nice, get an outdoor table facing Washington Square Park and people-watch. My only complaint is that service can be very slow. My friend and I were here for lunch once and waited almost 40 minutes for the check after we asked for it. I&#39;ll be forgiving since it was the day of the North Beach Jazz Festival, but that was really bad. Come for the food and the atmosphere.

Sit outside and drink some wine-- just be sure you get the one table with sunshine.UPDATE!!!!!So I have been to Mario&#39;s twice since this review and the Chicken #2 was lame... Still love the ambiance. Looks like I am going to have to order something new next time.

I discovered this place 7 years ago when I lived in north beach and even though I live in the mission I still make it over there whenever I can. There is something about those foccacia bread sandwiches that is so delicious. I have taken many different people there and everybody has loved the food. The mini pizzas are tasty too. I could eat the chicken sandwich #2 everyday. The atmosphere is great and coffe is strong, and on a nice day/night you can sit outside. My favorite place in North Beach by a mile. Minus one star because the waitress with the big eyes is kind of rude.

I was really disappointed when I went there in late May. I used to go there back in the 80s and early 90s and the food was so much better. The focaccia is completely different from the recipe they used back then, when it was fresh, chewy, and delicious - this time is was a little overly crisp and the flavor was just not very good. My sausage sandwich was cold and not much better after I asked the guy to put it in the oven again (annoyance factor). My partner&#39;s meatball sandwich was...meh. The hipster dudes behind the bar seemed not that excited with their job. I won&#39;t be going back to spend my hard earned smacks when there&#39;s so much other good food in this city!

The first time I came here, I had the grilled chicken focaccia sandwich, and it was great, if not overpriced. I liked the jalapenos they threw in. However, the second time I ordered that sandwich, the chicken was super dry, and I had to throw away half of it. A few weeks later, I gave them another chance thinking it was a fluke. But again, the chicken in the third sandwich was gross and dry, and I couldn&#39;t even finish it.If they start taking care of the food they prepare, I&#39;d be back, but I&#39;m not willing to risk another $10 to find out.

This is a fabulous little corner cafe in the heart of north beach. I love sitting outside on a hot day, sipping white wine and snacking on a delicious panini. The people-watching from this corner is great, as it is right across the street from Washington Park, and the food is wonderful. They cook it right inside at the bar in a large wood burning oven. The staff is kind and attentive. This place has a lot of character is a small, quaint, non-pretentious spot that doesn&#39;t ever feel touristy. Definitely check it out.

Came here with one of my new roommates as this is a favorite spot of his, and I have to say it was pretty good! Nestled in north beach, this Italian spot does a pretty good ceasar salad and we had something else resembling enchiladas stuffed with different fillings. Those were pretty good but I think next time I&#39;m going for something a bit more my speed- sandwich or pasta or something (if they have those). Split a bottle of wine, which was great, and chatted with people at the next table after they overheard our conversation regarding my roommates slut of an ex-girlfriend. I really like the bathroom for some reason, which I think has to do with the slanted ceiling, like you&#39;re peeing in an attic. Check this place out, it&#39;s got a relaxed, local vibe with good people all around.

Their sandwiches are soo filling! You can eat half and you will already be SUPER filled. This isn&#39;t a cigar store, I do not know why they even call it that. I think this place is really old because the place looks quite old. The staff was really nice, a lot of recommendations from them. The place is quite small and the tables are too. Their pizzas are good! Thin crust, I wished they would put more cheese. The food that I orders seem to take quite a long time to come!!

I went here with my Girlfriend the other day. The atmosphere in here is amazing. We were lucky enough to get a table right when we walked in despite it being quite crowded.The waitress that was serving us was a little slow, but at the end of our visit she had totally redeemed herself.I ordered the Combo sandwich, which comes with Swiss Cheese, salami, ham, mustard and mayonaise. She got the sausage sandwich which is served open faced. She also purchased a Salad but that did not arriave. The sandwiches we had were very good. I ordered an Anchor Steam off the tap, and she got a Coffee. The cup seemed a little small and the waitress forgot the cream. When we were getting ready to leave and asked for the check we mentioned the salad never arriaved. Appologizing she gave my girlfriend a free Biscotti and Coffee which made up for the lack of salad. All around our experience was good. Had the service been better it may have been pretty amazing.

Between three and four stars and pushing the culinary limits of what&#39;s possible with a glorified toaster oven. Mario&#39;s limited menu is consistently decent and they do panini, focaccia and small thin sliced pizza well. Good place for a simple meal, beer or wine, or coffee drink. Check out the photos on the wall of the family, including the original owner excelling in bocce ball and looking like the Soprano&#39;s Feech LaManna and son who is a dead ringer for ex Pittsburgh Steelers head coach Bill Cowher. A fine and authentic, low key, North Beach vibe.

Got quite a bit of writing done and had a great view of a guy playing Frisbee with his son in the park.

Tucked in a corner in the heart of North Beach, this is purely a San Francisco experience and great for people watching. You can&#39;t go wrong with any of the Focaccia and Panini sandwiches at this old Italian North Beach institution. Coffee is good and strong. Hit and miss on getting in as space is very cramped in this wedge shaped venue. Best to go at an off time.

After passing by this cafe many times, I never went in even though it looked alluring, but after hearing that they have the &#34;best foccacia sandwiches&#34; on Bay Area Backroads I decided to give it a go. I ordered the turkey foccacia with pepper jack cheese and onions, and I replaced the dijon mustard with red bell peppers. We sat outside and it was very comfortable, and the sandwiches came right away. Sadly, they don&#39;t carry &#34;exotic&#34; Torani flavors like coconut or mango, so I had to settle for a peach Italian soda. It was still yummy. The sandwich was very very tasty, nice crispy bread and great cheese.. kinda spicy too, which I liked. I had a bite of both the grilled eggplant and breaded eggplant sandwiches and they were awesome.

not only do they have an excellent name, these sandwiches rival molinari&#39;s (huge, packed with whatever of your heart&#39;s delight, and toasted) and its stellar location right on the square is a great place to watch the bums try to con tourists. they also have a short menu of more dinner-oriented items, but i haven&#39;t tried them yet.

after two years, and all my hangouts either closed, changed hands, or whatever ... good coffee, warm surroundings, and decent snacks

Go there Saturday to sit outside, watch people at Washington square park, have a beer, maybe even a great sandwich. Pay next to nothing, yelp about it and come back next week.

great focaccia bread sanwiches. the grilled chicken #1 and #2 are excellent as well as the turkey and the combo. great location for north beach people watching, especially if you get a seat looking toward washington square.
