An awesome sandwich place for sure. they have wide variety of meat, cheese, and bread options to make your sandwich. if you are not a daring and creative person and like to keep things simple then you can choose from there pre-set sandwich menu. the sandwich I had was Americano (Turkey, raspberry, lettuce, mayonnaise, tomatoes) there was good amount of meat in the sandwich for sure. the sandwich itself was under 10 dollars, I got a bag of chips, drink for another 3 dollars more.The service was great. the guys behind the counter where attentive, friendly, respectful and courteous. a small family owned business I like it. I am a sucker to small business.will go again for their sandwich. reasonable price for good quality sandwich.

It&#39;s all been said, but a few notes from my first visit:-I called in my order, adhering to fellow Yelpers advice. Glad I did, because lunchtime orders were many in number-On a whim, I tried their &#34;world famous&#34; potato salad. Pretty damn tasty-I got the #1 Italian on Acme Italian bread. Had I done my homework, I would have known to waive off on the mustard, which kind of overwhelmed my sammie.-Acme Italian bread was excellent, but the fixings wanted to slide out w/ every bite -- softer bread choice next timeGood stuff!Cheers!RS

I was here on Friday to get a deli Sandwich. The deli is cute. It is small with many Italian products in it which can draw you in. I decided to go here because I was walking past one time and there were some guys sitting on the benches eating deli sandwiches and they looked really good! I was not too impressed with this deli sandwich. I ordered an Italian salami sandwich with gouda cheese on rosemary roll. The produce on the sandwich did not seem fresh to me - Tomatoes, lettuce, onions, and pickles. They were all very cold as if they were frozen. The pickles were not crunchy. The lettuce was wilted. They do give a nice portion of salami on the sandwich. The cheese was good and the roll was not bad. I have had some good deli sandwiches in my life and this just was not one of them. I was disappointed.

This is my go to sandwich joint when in the marina. Sandos are well prepared with good wholesome Italian ingredients. Actual integrity of the sandos is good too they don&#39;t fall apart on you.

Best Italian sandwich I have ever had by far!!Go inside, grab a number at the counter, and wait for your number to be called to order. We shared the #1 Italian combo sandwich ($9) on rosemary foccacia. It was loaded with salame, ham, and cheese. The foccacia was the perfect texture and you could really taste the rosemary. The serving size was huge.When it comes to sandwiches I normally don&#39;t get Italian but this was exceptional and should be the standard for all Italian sandwiches.The deli also sells pasta, cheese, chicken, salads, etc. There&#39;s some benches outside so you can enjoy your sandwich. I&#39;m definitely coming back here again!

Not a whole lot of explanation required here. Old school deli, fantastic products, as good a sandwich as you can currently get on this planet. The area is also nice, so there is other stuff to walk around and do. They are a bit slow compared to the delis I&#39;m used to in the major US cities, so maybe order online before you head over, but even just grabbing a number it&#39;s totally worth the wait.

Worst sandwich, totally scrimped on the ham and cheese and it&#39;s not cheap. Would expect a lot more for $14 sandwich. The Mac salad was loaded with mayo. Go to molinari instead!

I&#39;ve never been to Italy so I can&#39;t say I know what an authentic Italian deli is like nor what an authentic Italian sandwich tastes like, but Lucca&#39;s sandwiches are pretty amazing and the deli is how I imagine Italian delis to be in my head. It&#39;s small space-wise, but the place is pretty much overflowing with meat, cheese, pre-packaged meals, snacks and chocolate/candy.I stopped by around 11am on a weekday and there were only a handful of people, so there was pretty much no wait. Grab a number and decide what you want to get while you wait for your number to be called. Some of the sandwiches specify a kind of bread, but I&#39;m pretty sure you can request any bread you want. The sandwiches are about $10 and they&#39;re pretty filling/sizable. They definitely don&#39;t skimp on the meat!I got:-THE #1 ITALIAN COMBO ($9) - 4.5/5[salame, ham, mortadella, provolone, lettuce, tomato, italian peppers, mayo, mustard]I asked for mine without mayo and got it on Dutch crunch. Quality meat and sooo flavorful! I loved the Dutch crunch as well. Rather than extra crunchy like other Dutch crunch I&#39;ve had that scrapes the roof of my mouth, the top of theirs was firm with a slight chew to it, and the inside part was soft and fluffy. I didn&#39;t eat my sandwich right away though, so the mustard made parts of the bread soggy :( Honestly, the sandwich had so much flavor from the meats already that I think it didn&#39;t actually need any mustard, so if you&#39;re not planning on eating your sandwich right away, I&#39;d recommend leaving out any spreads/dressings.My friend got THE PAT BURRELL ($11), which is their roast beef sandwich. I didn&#39;t try it, but he said it was really good!Not sure how busy it gets around lunchtime, but you can call in and order ahead to avoid waiting.

The porchetta sandwich was pretty good, lots of savory meat and enjoyed it at the park.It&#39;s not a bad deal for $10 for SF given the large portions. The Acme organic bread is a plus, too.The ordering process is a bit chaotic, just make sure to get a number first. And relax, because things can take a while, although this is common for any popular sandwich shop.

Small deli with great prices in SF with big sandwiches and delicious foods = long lines! Be sure to grab a number when you walk in, and/or order online ahead!Not much space inside to stand, but you can sit outside on their benches to eat.1. Smoked turkey make your own sandwich $7.99, with fresh bread (tons of options including acme!) - so tasty, glad they offer a cranberry sauce option2. Caprese salad - also super good and highly recommended, loved the freshness and sweetness of the small cherry tomatoes and the soft tender mozzarella balls. By weight. Didn&#39;t see any mozzarella di bufala though guys, sorry haha3. Fresh fruit salad - watermelon, melon, grapes, pineapple. All super fresh but a ended up a bit on the pricey sideOther things I need to buy next time:- handmade biscotti or chocolate covered biscotti- handmade cannoli if they any left- prosciutto- fresh focaccia that they have- other grocery items: flatbread crackers, cheese, pasta, or any of the other variety of Italian items they have, yum

The best Italian sub sandwich I have ever had! Our entire party said the same of their sandwiches!Funky old style Italian deli that has been around for ever. Their is an obvious commitment to made from scratch, quality food. They roast their meats in house, source the best of local bakeries breads and rolls and import the finest Italian meats and cheeses.I am Italian and grew up in New England eating &#39;grinders&#39; - I always have told my husband about how good they were and have been searching in California for something to match those flavor memories. The search is over! And my expectations exceeded!I got the #1 Italian combo without mayo and mustard subbing oil and vinegar instead! It has salami, mortadella and ham, I added capicola. It also has provolone, lettuce and tomato and Italian peppers - served on a soft Italian roll.It was divine! I can&#39;t wait to go back.Our party also had the Pat Burrell roast beef and horseradish sandwich, the meatball sub and the turkey with cranberry sandwich - all 5 stars!

Lucca Deli, 9/27 @3:30pmTo the older gentleman with the silver hair pulled back into a ponytail:As someone with over 15 years of restaurant experience (including a deli), don&#39;t mistake this review for someone &#34;trying&#34; to tell you how to do your job; because I&#39;m actually telling you how you should do your job.If a customer asks you, is something &#34;safe&#34; for a pregnant woman to eat, don&#39;t respond by saying &#34;we aren&#39;t your doctor&#34; and &#34;that isn&#39;t a fair question to ask us&#34;. Those are aggressive and attacking statements and have no place in customer service; especially with your tone and attitude.The appropriate response is, &#34;according to the medical literature, it&#39;s recommended that pregnant women avoid raw/uncooked food, meats with nitrates and nitrites, and anything uncured&#34;. So, *blank* item meets that criteria or doesn&#39;t. However, the final choice to consume it is yours. NO ONE would mistake a deli employee for a medical professional, nor hold you accountable as a medical professional.Now, I&#39;m going to guess (based on your assertive attitude behind the counter) that you&#39;ve probably been there awhile, and as such have probably been asked that question at least once in the past. So, it should have been your responsibility as an informed business of selling food, to educate yourself on the various dietary needs and restrictions of your customer base. And given the half dozen strollers I saw outside your establishment, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve been asked before.

Definitely recommend calling in for your order! Beats standing around, waiting to get your number called! We got 5 sammies, they were all pretty large, if anything I feel like I&#39;d be content with half the sandwich! But I just wanted to try everything so we decided to split between the 5 of us.Ordered the #1 Italian Combo, The Meatball, The Caprese w/ prosciutto, Americano (tasted like a thanksgiving meal in sandwich form), and The Calabrian. All were so delicious! My favorite would definitely be the The Caprese... the prosciutto, fresh mozzarella &amp; basil combo is to die for..., but nonetheless all were so tasty! All the ingredients are so fresh and they give a very generous amount of meat &amp; veggies (including the avocado), and just the right amount of dressing/sauce!For sure one of the cities best sandwich spots! Will be back to try more!! Want to try the potato salad next time too! The best part about this place is that its all under $10!

It&#39;s a $10 sandwich but the ingredients are top notch and the sandwich is huge.Great place to grab sandwiches for a picnic or hike (minimal bench seating outside makes it a to-go spot for the best experience).

Called in to place an order on my way, and was left on hold for 13 and a half minutes. Got to the restaurant, got a number, and politely informed them that they left me on hold. One employee didn&#39;t care, and two employees didn&#39;t believe me until I showed them the ongoing call on my phone and pointed to the blinking light on their phone. Got no apology, and no one cared. Terrible customer service, and poor management. Another customer who overheard my complaint commented that he was surprised I was so polite or even showed up. Never will return, nor recommend. Doesn&#39;t matter how the food tastes when you have a bad taste in your mouth from the service before the food arrives. Also was a clusterf*** inside because they have no organization.

Lucca is an authentic take-a-ticket Italian deli similar to North Beach&#39;s fabled Molinari.Stand in a delightfully cramped aisle while waiting for a huge sandwich with fresh ingredients. The line can get long, but there is online ordering if you&#39;re someone that plans ahead.The marina is great, but sometimes you just need an authentic sandwich from a place that doesn&#39;t call sandwiches &#39;sandos&#39;, meat is implied, and while they&#39;d prefer not to sell coconut water at all, they understand that in life, everyone must make a few concessions.

This place did not disappoint. I&#39;ve heard great things about this place and I really wanted a sandwich so I decided to check this place out. I will admit, the ordering process was a little confusing. I ended up not grabbing a number like I was supposed to but I was able to order. I got the #1 Italian combo on a rosemary roll and my mom got the ravioli. They were both absolutely delicious! I savored every bite of my sandwich and my mom scarfed down the ravioli in less than two minutes because she loved it so much. Even though I don&#39;t like potato salad, I will definitely have to get some next time since everyone on Yelp is raving about it!

It&#39;s in a really great neighborhood that you could spend several hours in walking around shopping and eating.I had the Pat Burrell and was blown away. If you&#39;re not a horseradish fan or don&#39;t like powerful horseradish, ask them to go light or hold off on it. I was just in town for the night but if I lived in the neighborhood, it would be my go to place for fresh bread, sandwiches, or anything deli.Be prepared to wait at lunch time.

Oh, Lucca, Lucca, Lucca. I saw Italian deli and was like wow. However, Lucca&#39;s Delicatessen didn&#39;t quite fit my definition of an Italian deli.1) They only have chicken parm sandwiches one day of the week?2) Best to just order burrata from a restaurant. This one is ok, but didn&#39;t light up my tastebuds.3) No heroes and no warm sandwiches. Now, that&#39;s just criminal. I swear melted cheese plus meat is like one of the best inventions ever.Now if you&#39;re looking for fresh pasta or a sandwich with cold cuts, Lucca might be your boy.

The sandwiches here are delicious and full of flavor. They don&#39;t get soggy! We drove home for lunch after picking up the Italian Combo and the Corned Beef sandwich. The flavors set it so deliciously and the bread was not soggy. They don&#39;t use too much sauce and instead expect the meat to be your flavors.They also get fresh burrata once a week. I got lucky and purchased the last burrata. Let me tell you, that burrata was probably the fresh I&#39;ve ever had. This place also has amazing salami. They have a really spicy one, ask them for their spiciest, and long behold, it&#39;s actually spicy. YAY!If they have fresh burrata, buy it. I also purchased the triple cream brie. The creamy texture added to the spicy salami, YUM! Definitely a place I&#39;d return to if I were in the neighborhood.

Awesome Italian deli but beyond average sandwiches..

I just tried a sandwich on it for the first time yesterday and was frankly appalled as to how bad it was! As my boyfriend says, &#34;Lucca needs to fire their dutch crunch guy.&#34; But fo real, serving sandiwches on that cardboard is embarrassing. Rosemary foccacia is much much better.

12-20-15Today I called Lucca&#39;s Deli on Chestnut Street.I spoke to a clerk to get the price on a pound of Sopressata and a pound of Coppa.$22.00 and $24.00....Wow!Actually more expensive than the ever-so-greedy Molinari&#39;s on Columbus Street.I asked the clerk, &#34;what brand do you use?&#34;He said, &#34;Columbus&#34;....I said, &#34;let me speak to the owner/manager&#34;....a woman got on the phone and I said, &#34;are you the manager?&#34; And she said, &#34;I&#39;m the everything&#34;.I asked her what motivation potential customers would have in buying the same brand of deli meats at Safeway or Lucky&#39;s at a much lower price.She said, &#34;we&#39;re not Safeway&#34;...I said, &#34;yeah I know that, but YOUR PRICES ARE DOUBLE&#34;. She said, &#34;so buy them at Safeway...she laughed&#34; and then she said, &#34;have a nice day&#34; and hung up on me.The only excuses for the higher prices:The district.The tourists.The stubborn customers who think her Italian meats are better than Safeway, Lucky&#39;s or Costco. Even though many are the same brands.Greed.True...Safeway&#39;s Delicatessens can make you violently ill (in violation of Health and Safety Standards). How about washing your hands, using the disposable gloves much more often. And stop mopping and cleaning up hours before closing time, with industrial products sitting on the counter tops.Soooo dangerous.So Lucca&#39;s little deli is immaculate?....hmm...I don&#39;t think so. So the higher prices must be greed.Merry Christmas!

Just so good!! That&#39;s really all there is to it, the sandwiches are always delicious and hit the spot. Lucca&#39;s is one of my go to spots when I&#39;m craving a sandwich, it&#39;s seriously one of the best in the city! I usually get the tuna sando with the soft sourdough roll, but I&#39;ve tried the prosciutto and a few other sandwiches and have never been disappointed. All the ingredients are fresh and most all of it is made in house.I normally go on the weekends are it&#39;s pretty crowded but they move through the line quickly and the wait isn&#39;t usually longer than 15 minutes or so. One more side note, I always go for the soft sourdough roll the regular one can be pretty crunchy/hard and it makes eating your sando a bit of a chore.

Been coming here for years and love the turkey sandwich with everything on an acme sour roll. Went in this week just to buy a coke and they charged me 2 bucks. I really don&#39;t care that they are at least twice the amount of other stores but 2 bucks for a 12 oz coke is basically a rip off. I&#39;ll still buy the sandwich which is five star but for overcharging on a coke down to four stars

The best sammich I&#39;ve ever had in my entire life bar none. And I got called a &#34;fat boy&#34; by a random homeless man downtown so you know I&#39;ve had my fair share of sammies. The sammiches are very large for the price and are packed to the brim with amazingly delicious and fresh ingredients. The deli and cheese options are fantastic and the attendant gave me some decently sized portions to try out before I made a purchase. Very much appreciated. I also ordered a small caprese salad and the guy at the counter forgot to add it to my order. When I went back to inquire about it, they just gave it to me for free! World class food, great customer service, charming atmosphere and a wide variety of cheeses, meats, deli items and sammiches make Lucca Delicatessen a must have for any trip to San Francisco. Finally, don&#39;t forget to take a number as soon as you arrive otherwise you won&#39;t get served. Or better yet, just order online if possible!

If you are nearby marina two things you can do. Stop by this awesome deli and choose your sandwich and walk down to marina and eat it against the golden gate, what would make an perfect SF day :) i had an italian combo, meat lover dream and my wife had an pastrami which is perfect. Ask for extra hom made pickles. :)

Best place we are while in San Fran and incredibly priced. In a great area with plenty of parking nearby. I had the turkey with a raspberry sauce that was perfection. The lines are long but well worth it. I&#39;d suggest if you are 10 numbers away to go to the bar just down the street and have a beer while you wait

This place was totally fine. But just fine. I was hoping for a sandwich that lived up to the rest of the reviews, but it didn&#39;t. The meat was tasty, and there was a cute selection of other Italian-imported goodies.The wait was super long, as there were just two guys slapping together sandwiches, and they were in no hurry on a Sunday.Make sure you grab a number the minute you walk in to get quick service.The good: I hate potato salad, and it was really good. I highly recommend it.The bad: service wasn&#39;t awesome.

God damn, the Marina is hella fucking annoying. But Lucca makes some excellent sandwiches. Wonderful array of choice meats and breads can satisfy any Sammy craving. However, some patrons on the other hand can&#39;t be satisfied with nothing and can be very rude. Even so, the people who work here are very nice and competent. My sandwiches have always come correct. The house peppers are divine and make their creations special. Deviled eggs are the best around. Chicken parm is a winner too. Don&#39;t forget to grab a number upon entry.

Very overrated. There are plenty of better options on Chestnut Street, such as Blue Barn and the newly opened Seed and Salt.I think people over-star this business due it&#39;s longevity in the area. For the life of me I cannot understand the draw of being packed in like a sardine during rush hour, the perplexing numbering system or the impossibility of obtaining sundry items when not ordering a sandwich.I hate to rail on service workers as well, I was one for many years, but when you are completely dismissive and in one case abusive to your customers you might want to ask yourself does pushing out sandwiches trump your relationship to your local customers. Although I have a feeling about that answer it seems Lucca has a definitive one.Good luck to all with this one.

I was so busy drooling over the pastas, deviled eggs, and serrano ham that I nearly didn&#39;t hear them call out that my sandwiches were ready. Enchanting selection of sardines.I would have literally bought everything in the store if it wouldn&#39;t have forced me to live under a freeway. But damn, it might be worth it.

Absolutely loved this little place and the Pat Burrell sandwich that I ordered. I thought the ambiance inside this little store was cool and I really wish they had a place just like this back home. At first, we didn&#39;t know we had to pick a number but since the place was so busy we realized it quickly. When I am in the SF area again I will definitely try and come back to this place.

My favorite delicatessen in the Marina! You can build your own sandwich or order one from their menu.Here&#39;s the deal:- Grab a number- Quickly figure out what you want. Type of bread/cheese/etc. Get your drink.- Pay &amp; EnjoyI usually get the #1 Italian Combo: Salame, Ham, Mortadella, Provolone, mayo, mustard, lettuce, tomato, mild Italian Peppers - $7.99If you&#39;re looking for a quick bite to eat in the Marina, then stop by this deli!

Maybe I ordered the wrong thing but I&#39;m not too impressed. I ordered the prosciutto Parma on Dutch crunch with everything and Swiss.The process:1) get a number for them to call you2) meanwhile look through the menu while you wait. Try to get all your questions answered before they get to you.3) order the sandwich you want you&#39;ll have to tell them- what type of bread- what type of cheese- what else (I just went for everything)4) they make it, you tell them what drink you want5) pay.6) enjoyThere&#39;s apparently also an app that you can pre-order from which will make your life a lot easier.

I love it here! I buy products daily from this cute little deli on chesnut street. As far as quality goes, it is unparalleled. Price wise, a 1/4 of turkey and a 1/4lb of salami would be $9.70, so prices are reasonable. My only complaint would be that it can become busy at times, and you might wait for up to 10 minutes in line. Otherwise, it is perfect. I will continue to go here for years to come.

I wanted to write an update to my previous review on Lucca. I recently saw that they added a sandwich board and on their sandwich board, they have 2 vegetarian sandwiches(caprese and a veggie which is loaded with tomatoes, artichokes, roasted red pepper, mixed greens, red onion, havarti, dijon and mayo on a rosemary acme roll) and 2 fish sandwiches(tuna salad and their shrimp salad sandwich which sounds Delicious and I can&#39;t wait to try that next)I was so pleased to see that they updated their sandwiches with some vegetarian options. I just ate the sandwich about an hour ago and was so pleased. It was delicious and had a great variety of flavor. It was a little heavy on the cheese but luckily i am a cheese person so I was fine with it. For a person who does not enjoy cheese as much as I do, then I would suggest getting a few less slices.Also, we tried to order these specialty sandwiches through their online ordering system and it wouldn&#39;t let us. Maybe it was malfunctioning today and won&#39;t other days but this is just a heads up that you may need to walk down and/or call in your order

This is an old school Italian deli. Possibly a little dirty in the corners. But, just don&#39;t look in the corners.Giant, delicious, expertly dressed sandos. The bread helps make it awesome. And, the meat is obviously well sourced.My only complaint was that we had to wait a god awful long time to get our greedy mitts on those turkey sandos. Like, 15 minutes. Oh well...I&#39;m trying to work on my patience anyway. Can&#39;t wait for my next samich encounter at Lucca!

Very friendly and helpful staff here... I&#39;ve heard a lot about Lucca&#39;s so I decided to swing by after some cardio (aka shopping) in the Marina. I came here at a random hour, so it wasn&#39;t jammed pack. It&#39;s a cozy little shop, so I would not come here during peak hours. I can only imagine how crazy it would get!Of course, I ordered the #1. Pretty good... personally, I&#39;m not a huge fan of Italian sandwiches since they tend to be too salty for my liking. I was just super hungry and scarfed the whole thing down, which I regret. Haha.After taking a more thorough look at the other reviews, it looks like the sides are also delicious... I gotta come back here to try them!

After walking the Golden Gate my boyfriend and I were hungry and craving a sandwich, so naturally I turned to Yelp. Lucca was the first one that came up (that was closest to us) and so glad it was the first choice.It was 2pm-ish and there was still a long line to order (we took this as a sign it must be good), but the staff handled everyone amazingly! If you&#39;ve never been here - grab a number &amp; when they call your number that&#39;s when you order. We found this out from a friend person who was waiting in line.All the food looks great, and our sandwiches were totally worth the wait! So glad we found Lucca, we&#39;ll be back next time we&#39;re in the area.

I am not one to exaggerate. This is the best sandwich I have ever eaten in my life. You get a massive sandwich for the price, and for the quality of their ingredients I would gladly have paid double. If I could give this more than 5 stars I would. The only thing I wasn&#39;t crazy about was the flow of traffic - it&#39;s very New York deli feeling - but that&#39;s personal preference, to each their own.

It&#39;s a small Italian deli with tons of hanging meat. Hanging sausages seem to be everywhere. They sell prepared deli salads (egg, tuna, pasta, shrimp), frozen pasta, olives, olive oil, cheese, candy, Italian wine, etc. and will make a sandwich for you. They have a huge selection of high quality meat to choose from (e.g., bresola, porchetta, speck, coppa), much more than the average deli. Grab a number first.* Pancetta sandwich: The pancetta was thinly sliced to order and they included plenty of cheese and pancetta on an Acme sweet roll, with mayo, mustard, lettuce, tomato, pickles, onions, and peppers. The roll was too hard and the fillings kept slipping out. But it was still a delicious, quality sandwich.* Meatballs in marinara sauce - the meatballs are huge and delicious but expensive, 2 meatballs are almost $6, the texture was too smoothThe sandwiches are priced by weight.

Not much to say here. It&#39;s basically perfect. Small, crowded, packed and smells great. The selection is marvelous, from meats, to pasta, to sauces, drinks, and a thousand other things. Staff is nice, and can be impatient, BUT there are 20 people behind you with #&#39;s in their hands so DON&#39;T wait until you get to the front to think about your order. Have some courtesy for the staff and make up your mind beforehand, or try to ask a question if you see an opening with the staff before you get your # called.Lucca has been a mainstay for me for many years, and a must-go to when I am on Chestnut Street.

Pros: Every sandwich we&#39;ve ever ordered has been delicious. In the Marina, we always prefer this place over Sandwich Spot unless we&#39;re craving a warm sub. The potato salad is incredible--get it even if you rarely/never eat potato salad. Ingredients across the board are top notch.Cons: A few of their employees are perpetually in a crummy mood no matter how hard we try to be friendly. Very cramped inside and can be a long wait, but ordering online or over the phone really helps to speed up the process. Price for the potato salad always makes me cringe despite it being so dang tasty. This is a minor complaint, but they often forget to put the Mild Italian Peppers on the sandwich despite telling them you want &#34;Everything&#34; on it.

Sandwiches are BOMB! There is always a line, but that&#39;s a good sign. I&#39;ve learned well. I have only gotten the caprese with mozzarella and tomato, but it is so fresh and sweet and yummy. It was the perfect spot to grab a few sandwiches and some deli snacks and then start a bike ride to Golden Gate Bridge, like we did. Once we got to the peak we opened up our sandwiches and enjoyed our lunch. Perfect! Try it!

To be honest, I&#39;m picky about sandwiches. There&#39;s alot going on with a sandwich that some places seem to forget. How fresh the pickles are, if the bread is too dry or too wet with vinegar etc. At Luccas my sandwich was well balanced, the meat was properly cut on the slicer so that it did not all fall out of the sandwich while eating it. Some places do not do this well, but Luccas does...in fact, all aspects of the sandwichs were great!!Perfect sandwich!

Lucca Delicatessen is a small deli that makes fresh sandwiches. This place barely has any walking room, but they are an awesome place for a sandwich place. There&#39;s not place to eat inside so the best thing to do is to take the sandwich to the nearby park or fort mason park.I brought a turkey, jack, avocado on a sour bread sandwich. The sandwich is a good 8 inch sandwich that&#39;s sliced diagonally. They put romain lettuce, pepperoncini, mayo, mustard, onions, and pickles with their &#34;everything&#34;. The bread is fresh and soft from acme bakery. There&#39;s a good amount of turkey meat inside... about 6 good slices that are nice and juicy. The avocado are slices and not a paste. They didn&#39;t skimp on the avocado either. There were around 8 slices of avocado inside. All of this for just $8 is a pretty good bargain.Service here is really great and pretty quick. There&#39;s quite a few people working behind the counter and all of they are nice.

This place is an original. I went here for the very first time yesterday and had the best sandwich ever. Yes, it cost a little bit more, but oh it is worth it. Lucca&#39;s is old-style, take a number, and tell the people behind the counter what you want. They have a wide range of sandwiches, mostly Italian inspired. I had the Muffaletta, on focaccia bread. Lucca&#39;s makes its own special relish that goes with the Muffaletta. It was so good!I have passed by Lucca&#39;s for years when walking on Chestnut but never went in to get a sandwich until now. There are dozens and dozens of specialty items, mostly all imported from Italy. It is easy to spend time there just looking around at all the food items and specialties. Yet, getting in the door is not easy. I went to lunch after 1 PM and still the line was out the door. Co-workers tell me to order in advance, helps save on the waiting time. Next time I go to Lucca&#39;s I will try the meatball sandwich. It is made fresh each day. I also hear that the past dishes are very good too.This is a classic place, well worth the wait in line. A good place to take in the local atmosphere of the Marina. The place has been on Chestnut for decades, it is well established and everyone knows it is good food. Perhaps that is why it is always busy with a line out the door.

Oh, how I miss this place!

Love this place! Great place to go if you have time to enjoy a sunny SF day in the Marina. No seating but you can definitely walk down to marina beach area and have a picnic.Their sandwiches are awesome, especially the #1. It is a little tight in the deli, especially when there is a line (usual) but the service is great and the people are super friendly. When there is a line, go grab a number before going to the back of the line. They do take a while to make the sandwiches but then you are assured a deliciously fresh sandwich! They definitely don&#39;t skimp on the amount of meat either! Their sides in the deli are also really good, especially the potato salad (supposedly world famous!).Another item that should be tried are any of their homemade pastas, especially lobster ravioli! I don&#39;t always see it in stock, but their boxes of cheese and meat ravioli are always in stock and also really good. Haven&#39;t tried their sauces yet, but heard amazing things of them too.

Love this tiny little authentic Italian deli in the Marina. One can easily feel claustrophobic during lunch hours, as the shop is barely big enough to fit 10 people waiting for their order. Salumi hangs above the counter and cases are filled with meats, cheeses, pastas and salads. In the fridge, you&#39;ll find an array of Italian beverages, alcoholic and non.For around $6.95 you can get a made-to-order Italian sandwich. The Super Special #1 is a delicious combo of ham, salami, mortadella, provolone, mayo, mustard, lettuce, tomato and Italian peppers. Their pepper spread made of imported Italian marinated red and yellow peppers is truly their special sauce. They&#39;ll recommend the Acme sweet bread for this - but if you want something softer, I&#39;d suggest getting a white roll or dutch crunch. They also make party subs - up to 7 feet long!I&#39;m also a fan of their housemade meat ravs. Still a bigger fan of the ones from La Villa in Willow Glen though.Service is very friendly, and pretty quick, even though the place does get packed. You can also order online to avoid a wait.

Love their chicken parmesan and meatballs but HATE their service. They forgot to heat up my food so i had to walk back and wait what seemed like forever for them to reheat it. Then i noticed they forgot to give us the cookies we wanted to buy. When my friend went back to retrieve them the large dark haired male said &#34;Now what?&#34; And then told my friend that those cookies weren&#39;t for him and that they don&#39;t provide receipts unless they ask. RUDE! RUDE! RUDE! I rarely ever write bad reviews but, I was appalled by this guy&#39;s behavior.

LOVE LOVE LOVE their sandwiches, especially prosciutto! I highly recommend Acme sweet or soft sweet rolls, dressed up as you please! The prosciutto just melts in your mouth, none of that thick chewy texture that you sometimes find in grocery store packaged prosciutto. Pair a sandwich w/ a bottle of San Pellegrino blood orange and you are set for an Italian party in your mouth!I would also recommend ordering online so that you can avoid the lunch line! Just pop in, let them know you&#39;re picking up, and enjoy the looks from bitter customers as you cut them all in line &amp; march out w/ your sandwich!

Hands down the best sandwich that I&#39;ve had in my life. Hands down.An extra pair of hands down for the best potato salad that I&#39;ve had in my life. So serious about this one, as well.I had this sandwich about a month ago while roaming around the Marina by myself, and I&#39;ve been thinking about it ever since.The service - Welcoming, but a little archaic. Upon entering, you are expected to pick a number and they make your sandwich made-to-order this way. The system seems to work for them, but for a newcomer it can seem a little disorganized and confusing. But, you are definitely experiencing a system that has been in place for what seems to be DECADES, which is fine by me, considering how satisfied I was with the sandwich.I ordered the #2 special, and the potato salad. I cannot STRESS how important it is that you order the potato salad. If you got anything out of the review that I am making about this place, YOU MUST take-away the fact that you MUST order the potato salad. Please do it. The sandwich, I do not remember much about other than the fact that it was delicious and out of this world. When things are so delicious I become a little entranced and suffer memory loss because my senses dull and I am in so much of a state of euphoria that I don&#39;t have the willpower to take the time to critique what is in my sandwich. Just know that it was heaven in my mouth.Anyway, I hereby declare Lucca Delicatessen the caterers for my wedding.Eat the potato salad.

A deli stocked with a wide array of fresh, high quality ingredients, from breads to charcuterie, including large selection of sides and fresh pastas. The pricing is modest for the large portions they give, especially if you consider the sheer quality of the ingredients.Look out for the famous Liguria Bakery foccacia - despite the competition with the freshly baked in-house rolls and fresh deliveries from Acme Bakery, both of which are superb, you can&#39;t beat dodging the wait times at their main bakeries for some of the best focaccia in the Bay Area.

6/1/2012: the day I discovered that sandwich-crafting is a high art. I&#39;m forever ruined for the run-of-the-mill deli. Sorry I&#39;m not sorry.Okay, so first, a word of advice: in order to be served, you have to take a number. Don&#39;t make the same mistake I did (mill around, feign interest in the various designer-colas, furiously read the backs of bottles to learn what differentiates virgin and extra virgin olive oil...as though you&#39;ve been desperately seeking that knowledge your entire life....all the while only really wondering one thing: WHY IS NO ONE PAYING ATTENTION TO ME?) Take a number. Skip the awk.Once you nail the take-a-number system, succumb to the specials.First, Pick a bread: Acme sweet, Acme sour, whole wheat , ambrosia, crack...whatever.Next, pick one of the specials: I recommend #1 or #2. Add pickles -- you won&#39;t be sorry. They are the not-too-dill-y, super-crunchy, delicate pickles that...again...ruin you for all other pickles.Third, pick a side. DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP. I asked the guy which salad I should try and, with a sly smile, he packed me a container of the macaroni salad. Then I watched as patron after patron entered to order gigantic takeout containers of just the macaroni salad. When I took my first bite, I understood why. Don&#39;t take my word for it -- try it for yourself.Finally, venture out to the street, find a bench (sorry, Starbucks), find a park (Marina Green?) and be ruined, like I am, for all other sandwiches.

Sweet baby salame this place is amazing. Truly authentic Italian flavors, large portions, for a super decent price! One half was good for lunch and I was able to save the other for lunch the next day. PerffffThe meat case is a work of art to be admired. I had the calabrian salame on rosemary focaccia (yum) with provolone and everything. I&#39;ve never eaten such a beautiful sandwich.I&#39;d recommend ordering ahead if you&#39;re in a rush. But waiting in line during peak lunch time took under 30 minutes so not bad at all! And you can look around the shop for other goodies to buy :)

Lucca&#39;s is great, they are my neighborhood deli. Yummy homemade ravs and sauces, they carry fresh foccacia made in North Beach (forget the name of where is comes from), and the sandwiches are HUGE and fresh and awesome.Molinari&#39;s is still my fave, but Lucca comes in a close second for sure.

Lucca Delicatessen is a throwback to a simpler time when sandwiches were created with attention to detail and quality ingredients rather than reheated processed meats. Meats and cheeses fill small galley store, but the staff is friendly and quick with your order to get you in and out. Don&#39;t forget to grab a number on the counter so they don&#39;t skip you!The Super Special #1 IS something to write home about. I tried to make it to a park bench before eating the sandwich piled with mortadella, ham, and salami on a soft sourdough role but to no avail. By the time I reached a park bench, my face and fingers were covered with the sandwich in all its glory. There are plenty of meats, cheeses, and toppings (including avocados) to create your own made-to-order sandwich so don&#39;t feel obligated to try one of their board suggestions.

Absolutely the best deli in the city. I eat here at least once a week and have never had a bad sandwich. It does get crowded which can be annoying but it&#39;s worth the wait!The sides are always good and I recommend the burratta and a baguette!

Decided to go here for lunch yesterday afternoon from my boss&#39;s recommendation. Was a little confused on how to order since there wasn&#39;t a set menu with a selection of different sandwiches. However above the food line, There is a black chalk board with the different types of Bread, Meat, Cheese, Ect. and on the bottom of that are two specialty sandwiches, I chose the &#34;Italian Special&#34;, one word to describe it : AMAZING!!!! AND ONLY $6.59!!!! I WILL BE BACK FOR MORE IF THIS SANDWICH!!!The funny part is I posted a picture and what I thought of the Sandwich on my Facebook page, and I got a response from a previous co worker responding &#34;Did you get this in the Marina, if so I know EXACTLY what and where you are talking about. Their sandwiches are BOMB!!!&#34; This place has a good reputation and will continue to have one in my book. Great job guys, keep up the good work!!!! If you ever want to try REAL Yogurt or Gelato stop by Yogorino for a taste test(Sample) just a few shops down. I can assure you&#39;ll love it!

Meatball Sandwich and Eggplant Parmesan! They have tons of goodies but those two are the top winners on my list from this store!Meatballs are tender and tasty, stash it between 2 slices of bread makes it a perfect picnic stash by the marina (or dinner at home). The eggplant parm is the best freezer stash you can get! Ready to pop in the oven for a rainy day or when you can&#39;t think of anything good to eat at home.

This authentic Italian deli feels like it got unceremoniously plucked from NY and conveniently placed within walking distance for my sandwiching pleasure. Go here for the best Italian sandwich in SF and literally every Italian specialty food you can imagine. Oh, and don&#39;t forget to get a numbah.Everything feels &#34;right&#34; here: spectacularly true-to-form Italian combo sandwiches, blunt staff, salamis hanging from the walls, and a &#34;I can barely squeeze through here!&#34; teensy tiny storefront. Love these guys.

3 STARS? Really? Well...I will give them 3.5 STARS.All this hype and great sandwiches that I hear from fellow yelpers, friends, and girlfriend...sad to say it is a little bit too much. This place has GREAT quality meats and have some good italian peppers with nice dressing...but that is where it ends.The reason why I will not be rushing out to go and grab another sandwich from this place is because of their bread. They have so many choices which is great, but what good is a great selection if you can&#39;t chew it? My mom had their sour dough, and I had their dutch crunch. Both were EXTREMELY TOUGH =[. I&#39;ve eaten some chewy bread, but this takes tough and chewy to another level. It was like having to rip every bite from the sandwich tough.If your looking for a great sandwich head over to Ike&#39;s Place, or Lou&#39;s Cafe.

I guess I just am starting to judge every sandwich I eat in comparison to Marina Subs -- and no place (has yet) has been able to beat it.Sure this place is clean (but small), the ingredients fresh &amp; plentiful, the prices reasonable, the counter help polite (and the guy who made my sammy was also quite cute!), and my order was made to my exact specifications (no onion, no mayo, provolone cheese please).I guess if someone REALLY insisted that they MUST have a sandwich there, or if I were on crutches and couldn&#39;t hobble up Fillmore street to Marina subs, I would go back...But I like my Marina Subs (thank you very much!)

I picked up a small container of their cheese raviolis in porcini mushroom sauce for dinner and ate it on the walk home. I couldn&#39;t resist. They were good, but would&#39;ve been better heated.I was hoping to try their turkey raviolis, but they weren&#39;t available. Hot food specialties rotate daily.

I&#39;ve passed by this place so many times walking down Chestnut that it wasn&#39;t until I checked the Yelp reviews of Lucca&#39;s that I realized I had been walking by a gem for quite some time.I came here for the first time not too long ago, and being the newcomer I was, didn&#39;t know to get a number as soon as possible at the counter. So I waited for a bit until one of the guys behind the counter helped me out and explained the system and said he would take my order anyway. I ordered the Italian Combo on Acme sourdough bread, with chips and a Mexican coke. The price wasn&#39;t bad, and although the sandwich wasn&#39;t as big as some of the other places in the Marina, it had great taste and left me full despite it&#39;s size.This place has all the different kind of breads and meats you could want in a delicatessen, with a friendly staff to boot. Although it is claustrophobic as hell (it&#39;s incredibly awkward waiting for your food to be made and having people grind their way by you), the claustrophobia is worth the wait.My sandwich was delicious and this definitely makes my list as one of the better sandwich places in San Francisco. I would recommend it to anyone who is hungry and in the neighborhood, and to anyone who loves different types of sourdough. A great spot to stop and grab some lunch to go.

On the sunny Saturday morning [it was really brunch time] before the Johnny Hi-Fi performance at the Chinatown Lunar New Year Street Fair, we took a quick side trip to the Marina. For lunch, we picked up a few things from Lucca Delicatessen and headed for the Palace of Fine Arts. The park benches were freshly cleaned from the previous days and nights of rain and were perfect for picnicking on.His sandwich was larger than the size of my face. Layers and layers of meats with condiments in between, all wrapped up in a fresh roll. It was really two meals, but he ate the entire sandwich in one sitting. I managed to sneak in a bite. Yum. They slice your meats and cheeses when you order, so you know it&#39;s FRESH. Because of my braced face, I grabbed two pastas - pesto pasta and their hand-made ravioli. Even without a microwave to heat up the two pastas, they were just perfect for a brunch-time picnic by the lake!A little on the pricey side, but a half pound of each pasta was more than enough for brunch AND lunch. And if the boyfriend wasn&#39;t starving, he wouldn&#39;t have scarfed the entire greater-than-face-sized sandwich in one sitting. There&#39;s a lot to choose from, so be prepared to pick and choose after you grab a number!

On a busy, sunny, summer Saturday, we managed to snag the parking spot IMMEDIATELY in front of Lucca - score! Went in and was told by the other customers in line that you have to grab a number in order to even get served. The place was extremely crowded and you could barely move around, but all of the food looked good and made me want to buy everything! I got the Sandwich #1 and I was excited by how I had the choice of which Acme bread it came on. Sandwich was large, especially for the $7 I paid for it! Only downsides is that there is no seating, and the sandwich is really messy to eat because of all the tomato juices/sauces dripping out.

It&#39;s been awhile since I&#39;ve been on here... so might as well start a comeback with a 5-star place!Luccas is fantastic. Everything is super fresh and they just have some of the best Italian meats I&#39;ve ever had. I had he #1, which was pretty much everything you can ask for. Ham, salami, mortadella, and a bunch of other stuff. The star of the show, however, is the salami and mortadella. Stuff is just awesome. Oh, and the peppers they throw on there.. they&#39;re not any peperoncinis or anything. They are some other breed of delicious Italian peppers. Make sure whatever you order has them on there.. well just order the #1, and problem solved.Place also seemed like it was frequented by locals. The place is kinda small, and can get packed.. so you may have a little bit of a wait.. but it&#39;s totally worth it.

It was a bit too salty for my taste, but that won&#39;t stop me for getting it again when I&#39;m in the area.The ambience is just amazing. It is a real deli, not just a sandwich shop. Meat and sausages are hanging off the ceiling, and there are cheese everywhere. I love it!This place was definitely worth it. If you haven&#39;t already, you must try it!

4.5 stars, only really because it is so incredibly tiny and there is literally no place to sit.However, when it comes to sandwiches, there are few places I&#39;ve tried ever which have such a variety of ingredients and freshness to it. It&#39;s almost sensory overload with the choices of cold cut meats, breads, fresh pasta, different types of readymade food, cheeses...you name anything Italian, you basically get it here. The staff is amazing and helpful and the pricing is great, especially for the area it&#39;s in.I ended up getting a special turkey sandwich on their sourdough bread. Delicious. And it only set me back $7. Steal, honestly.What they&#39;re known for? Try their fresh pastas and pretty much any sandwich. You really cannot go wrong here with anything on their menu.

Oh Lucca- I do wonder if people love you so much because Brian Wilson seems to frequent this place...and sometimes buys sandwiches for the locals. (I have yet to have such luck- but maybe one day!)Lucca is TINY. You&#39;re seriously packed like sardines as you wait to place your order. Nonetheless, the constant stream of people attests to it&#39;s deliciousness. I&#39;ve been here many times before, and am a little surprised I never wrote a review!They&#39;ve got an array of meats, cheeses, and extras and the staff is always friendly. My only complaint is that they run out of bread so quickly (and that sometimes it seems to be a little dry). Nonetheless, it&#39;s a great place for a sandwich- and especially nice to take them down to the water and eat!PS: Two sandwiches= $18 bucks. Not cheap- but so delish!

I don&#39;t live in San Francisco, but I try to come to Lucca&#39;s on most trips. It is that good. I have lived in the New York metro area, but this delicatessen beats any place I ever went to there for the best Italian meats. Salame, mortadella, rosemary prosciutto . . . I could go on. All on Acme sourdough bread (try to find that in NY). And an amazing spread. Order your sandwich with everything on it. You won&#39;t be disappointed.As others have said, it&#39;s cramped in there. We order sandwiches, go next door to Starbucks to order drinks and then eat there.

There isn&#39;t much in this world I love more than Yelping a great lunch and heading out to explore with my camera. The Yelp Gods pointed me to Lucca in the Marina for one of the best sandwiches in the city, and Yelp delivered yet again. This old-school Italian deli has been serving San Francisco for years because they keep it simple: awesome ingredients and passionate staff. Their breads are baked and delivered fresh every day from local bakeries, their meats are roasted and smoked that day, and the love with which they make their sandwiches is something special.They have a very wide selection of breads, meats and cheeses, not to mention some killer spreads and condiments. I went with salami, turkey, ham and pepper jack on Acme Sweet with everything, and I was very impressed. If you&#39;ve read my other reviews, you know how much I love sandwiches, and this place is really something special.P.S. Their potato salad is to die for.

Best cold sandwich in the Marina, if not the city. It gets pretty packed so avoid the 12-1 if you can. It&#39;s really compact so be prepared to rub elbows with the Marina&#39;s finest. It can be a great lunch and dinner combo if you pick up some sandos and their amazing ravioli. My only complaint is that there is a not much consistency between the sandwich artists. I think there should be a federal mandate on Mayonaise allotment. Hit me with one stripe on each side of the bread. If I order it, I want to taste it, but I don&#39;t need to swim it. I&#39;ve never had a bad sandwich there over the last 8 years, but the change in lettuce a little while back, was not an improvement.All things considered, this place is legit and if you are in the market for a cold deli sando, Lucca is your mando.

This deli reminds me of the small town deli in Tuscany where I vacationed with my parents as a child. Lucca has, by far, the best sandwiches in the marina! They have a large meat and cheese selection, plus delicious pre-made specialty items in the deli case. The line can be long during peak hours, but the staff works on moving people through in an organized manner. Make sure you take a number or call your order in! It&#39;s a must try! See you there!

I met a friend in the city for lunch and she had heard wonderful things about Lucca and thought it would be nice to try for lunch.On a Saturday afternoon, the wait was long but completely worth it. The time flew by, probably because there were so many delicious things to look at. Meats, cheeses, ravioli...My friend ordered a veggie sandwich that included roasted red peppers and she seemed to thoroughly enjoy it. I ordered one of the specials, pastrami and swiss. It was one of the most delicious sandwiches I have ever eaten. Lots of pastrami and not too much &#34;fluff&#34; (which, at other places, is usually a sign that they need to cover up sub par meat.)I don&#39;t live in the city but if I did I would go out of my way to swing by here after work to pick up goodies for dinner. They could also help you make a mean cheese plate for a party.Like others have mentioned, there are no tables and chairs but you may be able to sneak a seat on a bench a few doors down.

I love me some Lucca. Just great Italian subs with excellent cured meats and super fresh ingredients piled onto delicious ACME bread. All of their sides and a la carte items are great too, if not a little pricey. And everyone behind the counter is super friendly . Suspiciously friendly. They must give equity stakes to their employees or something.My only nitpicking criticism is that you have to squeeze yourself past the hungry and cranky masses in order to get to the register where you can take a number only to turn around and march right back through the comporomised personal spaces of the aforementioned hungry and cranky masses to the back of the line. Is there not a better system that can be installed there? Perhaps one that involves moving the number tag rack to the back of the line? Just sayin&#39;...

We happened upon this lovely place when we were famished for lunch as we were sightseeing. Nate and I made the mistake of ordering whole sandwiches for ourselves - we should have split them! They were so good, so HUGE!We also had some of their deli salads, but I am at a loss as to which ones. It was all really, REALLY good though. And the service was quick despite the crazy amount of people packed into that place!

I have an issue about people getting into my personal space. I can&#39;t stand that person in line behind me that creeps up like they&#39;re gonna make a home in my ass. It freaks me out, makes me wanna lose it, and it just plain uncomfortable.Of course that&#39;s totally normal when at Lucca, as there is no room to stand at all and you&#39;re lucky to get in the door most of the time, let alone be able to make it half way down the counter to grab a number before you are served.Authentic Italian meats, fresh pastas, and great homemade sauce, Lucca serves us a little bit of Italy while we&#39;re too broke to actually go there in person. They serve as a reminder of what may happen (a trip back to the boot) when we get some cash stashed in the future so we can go eat all this delicious food once again in the piazza under the stars on a warm summer night. Know what you want before they get to you, or at least attempt to, as the staff seem a little short most of the time cause they&#39;re just plain busy.Hot coppa is some of the best we&#39;ve found in the city, but the spicy toscana salami is outta this world. Crackers and a nice selection of wine, it&#39;s also a great stop on the way to friends if you need to BYOB or just put some extra goodies on the table.Just be careful and don&#39;t be like me with your venti Starbucks latte in your hands as people pile in. Instead of beveraging your delicious Starbucks, you may end up wearing it all over your shirt. I told you, it&#39;s tight in there.

I&#39;m embarrassed to admit that it took me four years in the neighborhood to go in to Lucca&#39;s. Maybe it&#39;s that the line is always so long and after my weekend workouts, I just get too hungry and turned off.WELL, DUH, THERE&#39;S A REASON FOR THE LONG LINE!This place is insane in the membrane, Cypress Hill style.I was tasked with cooking a birthday dinner and wanted a primo menu. I took my number and patiently waited (not that long actually) and was greeted by a very friendly, happy man who helped me plan the meal. Fresh made meat ravioli (so delicate), fresh made meat sauce (perfect blend of tomato and herbs) and a large chunk of mozzarella for caprese salad and finally, two delicious canolis. Everything was perfection and my friend and I sat in a major food coma last night afterwards.I also love all the Italian products they have available to buy: it really is just like being in Italy. Which is NEVER a bad place to be.Final note: long lines = good sign.

as soon as i walked in, i was mesmerized by how many things there are to choose from in this tiny little shop. it definitely has a very mom and pop family shop feel to it! they can create any kind of combo if you can name everything you want! I chose the #2 combo since i was way overwhelmed by how many things i can add to my sandwich. #2 was quite great with loads of salami and ham, and what makes this sandwich refreshing and not too heavy was this special red pepper relish (for lack of better words to describe it), think of it like a vinaigrette but chunky with diced and pickled red bell pepper. the acidity definitely cuts down on the fattiness of all the meat! and the fact that they make their sandwiches with acme bread is even better! overall, this sandwich is solid and i would definitely come back if i crave a good sandwich when I&#39;m in the marina!

Amazing tasty sandwiches and incredibly friendly service. There are quite a bit of ingredients to choose from, all of which - the ones I tried, at least - are very fresh and high-quality. Be prepared to wait a while but definitely stick around. It&#39;s worth it. If only I didn&#39;t live on the other side of town...

All the sandwiches I saw come out looked good. I got the #1 and it was delicious. Tried the potato salad, and it was great as well.

Looking for maybe one of the best old school Italian delis in SF? Well you can park the Vespa right here. This place rocks. Fantastic selection of choice high quality deli meats, and they make awesome sandwiches. Huge selection of rolls as well, from extra sour sourdough to acme sweet to soft rolls.But watch out during lunch time, the wait can get pretty long just because of the number of people trying to get sandwiches and the deli is pretty small on the inside. Though they do normally have at least 3-4 people making sandwiches at once and trust me its worth the wait.Also little or maybe now well known, fact this deli has been at the same location in SF since the early part of the 20th Century.

One of the best ways to spend a sunny afternoon in SF -- grab a sandwich from Lucca&#39;s and lay out at Crissy Field. Their bread is crunchy &amp; their meats and cheeses are all fresh and flavorful. You can customize your sandwich, if you so wish. I had the Special No. 1 and it was delicious. I had a bite of my friend&#39;s sandwich, which looked really plain (I think it was prosciutto &amp; cheese on white bread) and it was equally yummy. I&#39;ll definitely be back to try more. Probably the best sandwich spot in the city!

TAKE A NUMBER!I love their chicken parmigiana sandwich but it sells out early. The meatball sandwich is good but not amazing.For sandwich bread, the staff guide you towards the Acme sweat/sour bread. But they also have dutch crunch and some kind of soft roll.I haven&#39;t tried it but I saw people pick up trays of lasagna. Looks like that would be good to take home for a group/family dinner.

Made-to-order FRESH sandwiches at this vintage deli (a rarity here on the West Coast!). The roasted turkey was great. I ordered it on a wheat bun (they also have regular wheat bread and probably 10+ other bread varieties), with the regular toppings, and added avocado. The sandwich options are endless....they offer pretty much all the meat and toppings you could ever want, and will make it your way. A good place to grab and go...it&#39;s definitely takeout only. The place is tiny, so it gets crowded with even a few people inside. The deli counter full of delicious meats and cheeses looks great for local neighborhood folks.

Amazing Deli in SF.Outstanding sandwiches made by professionals w a smile. Fresh sandwich breads from the best bakeries in the bay area.I&#39;m addicted to their Mortadella special sandwich on ACME bread. It&#39;s finger licking good. This place is my first stop in SF to get this sandwich before going windsurfing at Crissy field.Fresh Ravioli and other deli items.Parking is a big problem on Chestnut Street but this place is worth getting a ticket for! Just kidding...............

This place is legit. Some may say it&#39;s cluttered and crowded, but it&#39;s cluttered and crowded with the coolest foods and Italian ingredients. It took a while to order since they get really busy, especially on the weekends- but it&#39;s worth the wait. They have salads and other foods you can buy by the pound to go along with your sandwiches. Lots of frozen handmade dishes (lasagna, ravioli, etc) if you need a quick meal to go. I wish I lived closer to Lucca Delicatessen because I would definitely be a regular...I want to try everything!

I don&#39;t make a habit of going to the Marina, but I will absolutely admit the sandwiches here are outstanding. I got the Italian Combo and it was delicious . I also picked up a half pd of fresh calamari salad to eat later for dinner(ended up also being outstandingly delicious). Next time I go I&#39;m going to get some deviled eggs too...they were calling to me but I didn&#39;t want to look like a complete oinker....shiiiiit I was in the Marina , that would be shameful to portray a life as a female who consumes food

Classic East Coast Italian deli offering good cut meats, simple sandwiches, and classic sides. Definitely one of my favorite delis in the neighborhood.My only gripe is that I have occasionally gotten a stale sandwich roll. If you&#39;re in the sandwich business, you MUST make your sandwiches on fresh bread! Biting into a sandwich and having to rip the bread away with great force ruins any enjoyment of the sandwich! Keep it fresh Lucca :)...

Don&#39;t be fooled by the Ike&#39;s of the world. If you want a real deli sandwich, go to Lucca&#39;s. Turkey, Roast Beef, Italian, Meatball, all fantastic. Sourdough roll can sometimes be a bit too hard, but overall the best deli around.

Don&#39;t forget to take a number so you can wait in line to take your orders, or else you&#39;ll be waiting for hours!I ordered a salami sandwich on a soft sweet roll with smoked gouda cheese, mayo, and tomatoes. All i have to say is that this was the best salami sandwich i have eaten.The salami wasn&#39;t too powerful or too salty. It was very soft and the cheese was delicious. The place is a bit small, but it has a very authentic Italian atmosphere to it. Lines can be a bit long sometimes, but it&#39;s worth the wait. Service is also very friendly and quick.I highly recommend anyone who wants an old authentic Italian sandwich to come here and you won&#39;t be disappointed. Just don&#39;t expect to eat there because there is barely enough to to just order.

&#34;Pancia mia fatti capanna&#34;Translation: How is it that I am not Italian? Places like Lucca&#39;s makes me really appreciate the true value of food and not only prepared foods but the greatness of having food imported from other countries like Italy. The shelves are packed and while I knew I was going to be getting something from behind the counter I wanted to take in the gorgeousness that is imported foods so I did not grab a number the minute I walked in.I was there just before the lunch time rush and can only assume that lines go out the door, either way there were people coming and going the entire time. There are great spices right as you walk in followed by a beautiful selection of Italian wines, as you walk down the very small aisle the items shift from wines to oils, vinegars to pastas to cheese. Lord how I am a sucker for cheese, while I was checking them out the guy behind the counter asked if I had been helped and being &#34;in the moment&#34; I almost couldn&#39;t speak and quickly said no.What is it about specialty food stores that catches my breath? Maybe it&#39;s the local flare, maybe it&#39;s the randomness that you may find inside; whatever it is I could spend hours in Lucca Delicatessen and will probably be spending way more than I have on some of their items.After I got past the moment and realized I did in fact want something, I grabbed a number and was quickly serviced. I ordered a cannoli, payed and left. Rather than save it for a dessert I ate it on my way out and the richness was absolutely heavenly. If you&#39;re in the Marina stop here for a sandwich, some sweets or if you&#39;re making a rustic Italian dish, grab some ingredients-you&#39;ll be so thankful you did.

Pretty good Italian deli with a nice selection of meats and breads. They would get another star from me if they had some interesting spreads or sandwich toppings... (pesto mayo anyone??). The deli also has a really big selection of packaged Italian food and drinks. It&#39;s a really small space so avoid going at a peak lunch time.

My parents always had a membership to the Exploratorium when I was a kid, which meant we went down there quite a lot. Of course I loved the museum, but what I loved almost as much was the inevitable trip to Lucca&#39;s and the picnic on the Palace of Fine Arts lawn before our science discoveries.The foccacia is to die for, especially the kind with tomato sauce on top. Sure, it&#39;s messy, but that&#39;s half the fun. The sandwiches are super tasty, and the pickles are huge and sour.They also have a huge selection of cheeses, salads and sides, and lots of Italian pantry items. They&#39;re on the pricey side, but good if it&#39;s a special occasion or you&#39;re looking for something specific.P.S. Don&#39;t forget to take a number (in the middle of the counter) as soon as you get there, otherwise you&#39;ll never be served.

Favorite sandwich place in the Marina, maybe in all of SF. What&#39;s good:- The super special #2- The fact they will substitute oil &amp; vingar for mayo &amp; mustard- Wide selection of drinks and other items- Soft sourdough roll- Macaroni saladAm dying to try the pumpkin ravioli. The only possible drawback is that its tiny and awkward when there&#39;s a million people in there. However, well worth it. AND for a bargain price ($6 or so) which you never find in the Marina.

Lucca&#39;s Deli is absolutely wonderful. It&#39;s an authentic little Italian place that makes the best sandwiches. They always make me the most awesome Speck and Mozzarella sandwich on buttermilk bread. I&#39;m a big fan of their Caprese salad and the sea salt butter cookies they carry. All the food they have is prepared there and with the freshest ingredients.Lines form out the door sometimes, this place is so good. They have a freezer section with all sorts of pasta, raviolis, and sauce that you can take home and prepare yourself. I&#39;ve taken home a few bottles of wine and Italian sodas too. For dessert, they have pints of gelato. It is a tad pricey, but for home made meals and sandwiches, like Nona used to make, it&#39;s definitely worth it.

Looking for sissy sandwiches? Then don&#39;t come here, cuz Lucca&#39;s are ginormous!If you&#39;re planning on heading over to the Palace of FIne Arts, I&#39;d recommend stopping by Lucca to pick up a bundle of eats to enjoy. Order up a sando w/ 1 of the many breads they offer (Soft Sour, Hard Sour, Soft Sweet, etc.) and have it filled w/ 1 of their tasty Italian sliced meats, or whatever else catches your fancy. Make sure to add a side of their &#34;World Famous&#34; Potato Salad, which is definitely THE best Potato Salad I&#39;ve ever had. I brought 2 lbs. to a picnic earlier today and it was gone in a flash!When you swing by here, be sure to snag a number in the middle of the counter. It&#39;s practically assumed that everyone who comes by, has been there before and knows the rule, but once in awhile you see the newbies standing around for a good amount of time till they realize the protocol.The drink selection here is plentiful w/ wines, sodas, juices and I belieeeve beers. They also have hard-to-find Italian ingredients. For ex) I picked up some Hot Cherry Peppers and Italian Tuna in Olive Oil when I couldn&#39;t find any at the Marina Supermarket. Phew!The staff here is super friendly &amp; chill. The only gripe I have is that I&#39;ve seen them handle money w/out gloves &amp; then immediately dive into sandwich making mode. yeech. Glove those puppies!

Super Special and a nice drink is a great lunch. I am always trying to decide between this place and the sandwich spot and usually it&#39;s a tough decision as they are both good. In this case a coin flip works well. So far I have gotten the super special combo at least 3 times and it never disappoints. Always get it on the dutch crunch. This place has a great selection of meats, cheeses, specialty products, drinks, salads, and more! Everything looks yummy. It is a bit pricey, but hey, you only live once, and they take visa ;)

All I can say is they make the best sandwiches in San Francisco period. You need to try this place. It is awesome, authentic italian deli with delicious, high quality meats and cheeses. You can get a huge sandwich for between 7 and 8 dollars. I always get the serrano ham, genoa salami, and provolone with roasted red peppers. It is sooo good.Another thing they make really well is the macaroni salad. It is better than my mom&#39;s which I crave even as an adult, (god can I say that without feeling guilty??)If you find a better sandwich shop, let me know. Now that I live in Walnut Creek, they have Genova Deli which doesnt even come close to Luccas.Luccas rules!

I am fairly new to San Francisco. But I know good food when i eat it. Sandwiches from Lucca&#39;s Deli are by far the best sandwiches i have ever had. Throw in a half pound of potato salad and you&#39;ll be in heaven. I usually get the #1 special or the corned beef sandwich on hard sour bread. Cant go wrong with either of those two. Thanks to my father in law for taking me here. The search for a sandwich shop in San Francisco for me is over. Lucca Deli is the place to go.

A solid 4 stars.Had a ham and cheese sandwich (combo #2) that was only $4.99 and my daughter had the pasta of the day with a meatball. Everything in the sandwich was fresh and the mayo that they used was really creamy. As for the pasta with meatballs, it was just ok. The meatball had a strange texture to it and it was a little dry.One of the better deli&#39;s in SF for sure. Still not as good as the Sausalito Gourmet Deli across the Bay though.

We used to order Lucca at work on some Fridays and they&#39;ve been getting worse rather than better. Mixed up orders the last two times, not updating their voicemail or web site to tell us they aren&#39;t taking orders via the web any more, etc.Even after providing them with feedback on their customer service and their inability to make our sandwiches correctly they continued to give us attitude with arrogance like we were doing something wrong by telling them they made sandwiches incorrectly.The lesson here is buy the ingredients yourself and make your won sandwich I guess.

They always have fresh bread and an assortment of ready-to-eat foods, but I come here for the homemade raviolis. They keep them in the freezer. They also have a lot of harder to find things that I will come here for. Plus you never know what new food you might find.

Awesome authentic Italian deli, I wish I hadn&#39;t waited so long to try it. I am not sure if it was my hunger kicking in, but everything in the store looked absolutely delicious!Take a number and wait about fifteen minutes (totally worth it). The sandwiches are delicious &amp; they have a very good variety of breads (I liked the hard sour). The cannolis were amazing as well. I need to go back asap and try the focaccia, it looks amazing as well as the pasta &amp; ravioli. I definitely foresee many trips back to Lucca!Prices aren&#39;t too bad a sandwich (with cheese) &amp; a cannoli will cost you about $11, and well worth it!

After a workout on the green, this is one of the places I crave. The proscuitto sandwich is bomb and the delicatessen stocks some rare culinary treats (I found Coleman&#39;s Mustard there, something I&#39;d been looking for for a while).Their sausages are also delicious! Instead of going out to breakfast you can take the sausage out of their casing and make a bomb scramble.At any rate, if you&#39;re in the Marina and hungry, cruise by this low key joint for a great sandwich! Keep in mind though, that there are no tables or chairs, as it&#39;s a small space, and if you go at peak times the line may be out the door... which signals (to me anyway) this is a place worth the wait.

How sad is it that an out-of-town friend visiting from MA had to introduce me to Lucca&#39;s...me a N. California native? Well I live in the South Bay, does that sad excuse count at all? I&#39;m not sure either.Anyway since we were in the Marina gorging ourselves on cupcakes and candy...she told me about this fab Italian deli that she previously visited multiple times on various trips. We drive by, she spots it, we park almost right in front. Score!This place is Tiny, with a capital T. But the amazing selection of Italian deli-type items is not Tiny. In fact it&#39;s quite Large. They pack a Ton into the small shop...including a Ton of sweaty, smelly San Franciscan bodies who are all jockeying to get a number and then get to the glass cases to see what they want to order.I figured they MUST sell Big Italian Meatballs, and I was right. I came home with 4 which I will cook into something resembling a spaghetti and meatball dish tonite. Too bad I already told the hubby that I bought them because I could have tried to take some meatball-making credit and pass them off as my own to get some domestic props. I also got some meat ravioli for lunch this week...funny thing is they are green inside so I thought maybe I got spinach instead but nope, there is something like meat in there. So not quite sure WHAT is in there, but man they were good.The staff helping seemed kind of hit or miss. My guy was really friendly and even went to the back to check for meatballs. My friend&#39;s gal was really brusque, and kept asking her to repeat herself...my friend was pretty irritated after the fifth time of saying everything 2-3 times.My visiting girlfriend came away with their famous macaroni salad, some caprese salad, and a bunch of cheeses. Tasty. Next time I am cupcaking it at Kara&#39;s...I&#39;m heading over to Lucca&#39;s for more meatballs.Random update on the meatballs, man are these things tasty, they almost fall apart when you poke them with the fork. YUM. Double darn about not passing them off as my own. I&#39;d be a legend.

Lucca makes a good sandwich, without question. Big with fresh ingredients, but nothing to write home about. Friendly, attentive staff always makes a quick stop at Lucca enjoyable.

My first taste of authentic deli sandwiches and I think this place is truly the best. The shop is small but fill with amazing cuts of hams and a great variety of cheeses. The people are friendly and patient as well (I am pretty slow :( sorry for those a line behind me) and the price is just shockingly low. I ordered their number one sandwich but picked the wrong bread though. Is still good :P

Go-to sandwich #1: Parma Prosciutto, mozzarella, tomato and pesto on extra sour. Cost: ~$8-9Go-to sandwich #2: Roast beef, provolone, dijon mustard and everything except mayo (everything = lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, mild italian peppers, mustard, mayo) on extra sour. Cost: ~$8Pros:- Best bread selection in the Marina. Extra sour is baked in-house and they have a bunch of other kinds from the Acme bakery such as soft sour, rosemary, seeded sour, wheat. I am a firm believer that the quality of the bread can make or break a sandwich.- Numerous friendly guys/gals behind the counter. The wait can sometimes suck, but there&#39;s usually about 5 people back there taking care of orders.- Browsing through the huuuuuuuuge selection of meats, cheeses, pastas, salads and Italian goodies is a fun way to pass the time when there&#39;s a long wait.Cons:- Aforementioned occasional wait time- Sandwiches aren&#39;t as big as the other places- Everything&#39;s priced to order, so you never know exactly what the sandwich price will be- They usually run out of extra sour if you don&#39;t get there early enough.Other comments:On more than one occasion I have gone to Lucca&#39;s twice in the same day - once at noon to get a sandwich and again in the evening to pick up some fresh-made ravioli for dinner. Lucca&#39;s rules.

LOVE this place. Despite the long weekend lines and slightly higher prices, Lucca Deli is my favorite deli. Everything is so fresh! The meats are sliced only when you order your sandwich, and their unique pepper spread is tangy and delicious. Lucca has more varieties of cheese and salami than I can remember; go in and see for yourself, and prepare to be pleasantly overwhelmed.Tip: The Sunday staff is hot; stop by to watch really good-looking people make you a sandwich.

A-mazing.I&#39;m a pretty laid back sandwich eater, the ham &amp; cheese usually settles my tastebuds...but THIS ham &amp; cheese was really delicious. I don&#39;t know how many variations you could possibly get of a ham &amp; cheese but seriously, these guys know how to make a good sandwich.The place gets super busy at lunch time so don&#39;t go if you&#39;re in a major hurry. Although, It is worth the standing time.The sandwich makers are friendly and helpful. There&#39;s not a typical menu up to read, so I&#39;m convinced they&#39;ll make anything you ask for.Everyone said this place is pretty pricey, but I paid $8 bucks for a sandwich (that was huge) and chips--not too bad for over priced Marina.I will be spending another $8 dollars on another sandwich next week and you should too!

Love this place. The meat and cheeses are delicious and fresh. The special #1 was really good.. They carry amazing meat, spinach &amp; cheese raviolis as well.The only thing stopping this place from getting 5 stars is that they do not use gloves while handling the meat and cheeses; even after handling money and etc..

I happen to LOVE sandwiches, especially the ones from LUCCA. It must run in the family. My dad used to treat himself to a Lucca turkey sandwich every now and then back in his high school days!35 years later, the sandwiches are just as memorable.Sinking my teeth into a thinly sliced salami and swiss on acme sour w/ the works is seriously a little bite of heaven for me.Not only are the sandwiches fabulously sandwich-licious, everyone who works there is really friendly! Also, ordering online is so easy and convenient!

On my first visit to the Marina I scored and found this cute little Italian deli. If only I lived in the city, I would be there at least every week.Sure you have to take a number and stand in line, but it&#39;s worth it. It&#39;s a real sandwich, not a wimpy Subway/Quiznos. It&#39;s the real thing -- a must try for first-timers and a great dig for locals.See you there! Ciao!

Fresh, good quality sandwich. I really enjoyed it the first time, wasn&#39;t as great as I recalled the second time. Nowhere to sit as it&#39;s a small market. The city of SF is a little bit too excited about their Dutch Crunch bread.

Italian through and through, always offers a certain charm. I got their super special. In short Lucca doesn&#39;t add tons of bells and whistles rather simplicity in high quality.

4 stars maybe more. I&#39;ve always seen a big line for this place. Today I decided to try it out. Went for lunch and ended up getting an &#34;italian&#34; without cheese, I wasn&#39;t sure where the full menu was. My italian was a solid sandwich and I got a gigantic pickle too. I was impressed with it and will be coming back here to try other stuff in the future.

San Francisco is my home away from home. One of the reasons why I love SF so much is the food! I was there last weekend and I was so hungry that I would have ate anything. First stop was a liquor store/deli. Good thing my boyfriend refused because the next thing I yelped was Lucca! Luckily, we found parking no problem with an hour still on the meter (which made the experience THAT much better), the deli is very small but right when you walk in you could tell this was going to be good. Picked a number, line moved fast and the menu was very easy to read. Pick a bread, type of meat, and all the essentials. I got the pastrami with provolone cheese on soft sour bread. Everything on it including pepperoncini. Pastrami was cut right in front of you! Took a bite and it was heavenly! Best sandwich I&#39;ve ever tasted and I had my share of good sandwiches!

I&#39;ll continue to think I&#39;ll try that quiche next time or maybe the meatballs. But we all know I am going to get that same roasted Turkey sandwich on a wheat roll. No onions please.You guys behind the counter are awesome.

I like to pick up some pre-made goodies before heading out to a picnic by the beach. This place is so friendly but really busy during weekends. I love their cold anti-pastas, salads and their meatballs too! Actually, to be honest I liked everything I&#39;ve tried.I always tell myself to get some fresh sausages for a BBQ but I forget.. When I do, I&#39;ll make sure to edit my review.OOh and decent wine choices as well

I gotta give Lucca&#39;s Deli an extra star just for putting up with me! I was so indecisive, pressing my nose against the glass asking &#34;what&#39;s this? mmm, that looks good, would it go with this?&#34;I was overwhelmed by all the possibilities! So many amazing meats and cheeses and breads!! It&#39;s a sandwich-lover&#39;s heaven! ESPECIALLY if you love old-school Italian delis.The guy behind the counter was patient and helpful and not only did I get an incredible Italian sandwich (the works, on dutch crunch bread) but I also left with extra goodies - a baguette and some serious truffle-infused pecorino.

I love this place! If I worked in the Marina I would eat here at least three times a week. You can&#39;t get a bad sammy! My favorite is the vegetarian. They put roasted bell peppers on it, which was what sealed the deal for me. It&#39;s also pretty inexpensive. I know the word on the street is that North Beach is where you go for good sammy&#39;s, but for those who don&#39;t always want to hop on the dirty 30 and make the trek I say go to Lucca. You won&#39;t be disappointed. In fact, I promise you will be back for seconds, thirds and for sure fourths.

As I approached the counter to take a number I hear a voice in gruff New Yorkese, &#34;Ah! I fuhgot ta grab one-a dose&#34;.I take a number and hand it to him because he was already waiting. That&#39;s just what you do, right?Guy: &#34;Um..uh...well, thank you!&#34; Takes number. I grab one for me.Guy: &#34;You know, you&#39;d nevah last a day in New Yawk.&#34;Me, chuckling: &#34;I know, I barely last here.&#34;Guy: &#34;You deserve a CANNOLI for your kindness!&#34; The guy points to some beautiful cannoli in the case.Me: &#34;Oh, no, no! That&#39;s not really necessary.&#34; I had never had one before.Guy: &#34;Ah, C&#39;mon! If you don&#39;t eat it you can give it to your husband...or your boyfriend.&#34; Knowing he was fishing, but that he was not within my dating specs, I didn&#39;t mention I had neither.Secretly, I was caving in. So I let him return the kind gesture...&#34;Oh, okay. Thank you.&#34;He seemed thrilled.We chatted and he shoved the boxed cannoli in my hand as he left. As I walked out, people were eyeing it and commenting on it. I know...and I tell ya, it was fantastic.Holy Cannoli!I love, love, LOVE this place! All my favorite italian deli meats, A great selection of artisan cheeses, including one from a small town in Italy made by a Father/Daughter owned farm. I was able to buy a slice off only the SECOND wheel they&#39;ve ever exported. Talk about authentic! And it was fantastic!I got a chance to talk to one of the owners and she often gets interesting cheeses like that in.Service was great, and the store was cozy well-stocked and clean. I would recommend this over that other well-known deli in North Beach.

One of my favorite Italian delis in the city. Hard crunchy sourdough rolls, fresh meats, killer potato salad, nice smell when you walk in.Can&#39;t complain, I frequent here at least once a week to pick up lunch or dinner. My favorite is the roast beef or Super Special #2, which is reasonable for a quality Ital sando ($5.99). I&#39;d choose this place over a $4.99 Safeway sando any day.If I had to nit pick on a few things, it&#39;s that the rest of the stuff here is wildly pricey ($17-19 / per lbs for deli meats) and they take their sweet time to make sandwiches, whether there is a line out the door or not. But perfection has its price, as those quirky Stella ads say.

Just finished a delicious super special #1. Great sandwich at an excellent price ($6.79 I think). I can&#39;t wait to get hungry again and dig into the ravioli waiting in the fridge. It was a little cramped in there but the customers were nice and I only waited 10 minutes for service. I&#39;ll be going back the next time I have a long lunch break.

Small, crowded, and filled with some of the best cheeses, meats and wines you can imagine. What a great blessing to have this place within a few minutes walk from home. The Marina needs more places like this, and less Gaps and snooty restaurants.If you&#39;re looking for bargain-basement pricing from a chain store is for you, then Lucca&#39;s isn&#39;t your scene - but if you&#39;re looking for quality food from an old-school local neighborhood store, this is the place for you.Sometimes it&#39;s fun just to walk in and take it all in. Just be sure that from time to time you walk out with a nice wheel of cheese or a bottle of Italian wine. :)

This used to be a very intimidating place for me. I came in for some anchovies and capers, not so romantic, and definitely don&#39;t want to spend the night with me after that dish (porchetta al tonnato), and i went up to pay but was told I must get a number.&#34;The other customers get a little anxious&#34; said the nice, big italian dude behind the counter.By time number three of wandering in, we were swapping recipes and they were telling me where their favorite cannoli in the hood is -- little bakery on Mission -- on condition that i would bring them one back. natch.Really, though, I come here because they keep me in good canned tomatoes, tuna in olive oil and caffeine--my lavazza costs only $5 here. bliss.Now i kind of dream of one of the big Italian dudes proposing marriage and taking me home to the big Italian mom. I&#39;ll bring the cannoli.

The best thing about Lucca is its proximity to the Palace of Fine Arts. Veggie panini and a can of Orangina in hand, the benches in front of the duckpond beg to be sat on. The pigeons fly, newlywed couples strike bizarre and convoluted poses, and the sandwich is delicious. Every freshly made part of it. Just be prepared for the line.

Chaotic and cramped and a little confusing to a newbie such as myself. I was looking for fresh ravioli, and all I saw was cooked (in the deli case) and frozen. Intimidated by the hurried customers who seemed to know much more than me (and who seemed to want me to get out of their way), I tentatively selected a box of pumpkin rav. from the freezer case. Then, my savior behind the counter informed me that he&#39;d just made some fresh pumpkin a few minutes ago, would I prefer that instead? YES!!! I&#39;m sure the frozen would have been fine, but mmmm hmmmm, gotta love fresh pasta. Perfect with a brown butter sauce and parm cheese. I can&#39;t wait to go back and try some additional flavors.

Hell yeah! This is a sandwich. Great ingredients, perfectly balanced and HUGE. Split a sandwich and a couple of salads with a friend for a perfect lunch. I LOVE the potato salad and cici bean salad. The ravioli are a classic.

Best bang for your buck in the city. People who work there are very friendly and happy to help.

There&#39;s little I can add to the other reviews. I was a regular - as in five days a week - when I worked nearby, and even now on occasion will cross the city in search of the finest Italian sandwich fixings in town, plus canned and packaged treasures you&#39;ll never find in the ethnic aisle at Safeway.

Stopped in here to check out the goods and saw a small line of ppl ordering sandwiches. They had quite a few dried pasta items, pasta sauce against the wall etc but it&#39;s definitely not the same ingredients and fresh meat counter variety compared to Palermo&#39;s Delicatessen in North Beach.

The guys do not use gloves. they touch the money and then make your sandwich.

Great sandwiches, that&#39;s for sure. But the ravioli is what keeps me obsessed- great hearty meat sauce, right amount of parmesan. So, so good. The salads are all good, and the cannoli- it makes me proud to be Italian.

I love getting my sandwich here because it is so delicious and fresh! I enjoy trying different meats and bread, all excellent! It&#39;s so good that I get cravings for it often. My mouth is watering thinking about it.

gah luccas! so wonderful! but beware, if claustrophobic this is NOT the place for you. this is pretty much the only reason I go to the Marina district. Everything is absolutely fantastic. I&#39;ve had their fresh stuff, and frozen stuff (if getting frozen pasta to take home, ask for the meat sauce, you must have it!) its a bit confusing to go in cuz you wanna look at everything but you get in everybody&#39;s way. but dont take a number if you dont know what you&#39;re getting. figure it out first then take your number. it is worth every price and any price.

This place has been around since the old days; unusual in the constantly changing Marina district. It is refreshing to go to a deli where they still know how to make sandwiches compared to the chains. Fresh breads, quality deli meats &amp; cheeses with the right amount of quality mustard, mayo, condiments. There is home-made ravioli, pasta salads, meatballs, &amp; other things that will prevent you from walking down Chestnut without stopping. Everything is tasty &amp; of high quality without being too exquisite or fancy. It is staffed very well on the crowded lunch hours with folks who are professional, polite, &amp; can hustle. Lucca should continue to endure since the soul in this tiny place is disappearing in the rest of the city. Don&#39;t change a thing.

Had a &#34;make your own&#34; sandwich. They make one awesome sandwich. I don&#39;t know what it is, i mean, a sandwich is just meat, cheese, bread, and condiments, but man do they make it right! Ordering a sandwich online via their website is pretty damn cool too!!!

The sanies here are sooo good. I can&#39;t believe I had never been before. Definitely pricey compared to other deli shops. I paid $10 for a sanie and a Snapple, wtf??!? It&#39;s crazy busy in here and you should definitely know what you want before you take a number. The guy who made my delicious turkey concoction was extremely quick and efficient, my friend&#39;s order took FOREVER. Be prepared for a wait, but the food is so worth it.

The Special #1 or the Special #2 are really delicious. For very little dough you get a lot of dough (as in bread, work with me people) and meat and cheese and veggies and it&#39;s just fabulous!!

Italian Super Special #1. In addition to it just being absolutely amazing, the rosemary bread leaves this heavenly aftertaste in your mouth that lingers for a couple minutes once the sanwhich is gone. Their meatballs are pretty damn spectacular too and I&#39;ve heard the potato salad (which they offer free tastes of) rules. I have no idea why I haven&#39;t just asked about sampling it.

i&#39;ve been here quite a bit since I live down the street; i&#39;m not italian and don&#39;t know what authentic italian means, but sandwiches are just okay, pasta salad just okay, meatballs just okay, and the meat ravioli just okay, cheeses are just okay...get the ideasandwiches: my biggest gripe is the inconsistency, mainly with the sandwich makers; i&#39;ve tried almost all their cuts except their head cheese; especially all the salami cuts; the only plus is their swiss cheese is above average (not sure what it is)pasta salad: to me its the same as any deli, i guess their big thing is they don&#39;t use any mayo; if that matters to youmeatballs: favorful, but texture is mushymeat ravioli: i think they use the same filling as meatballs, they don&#39;t give you much red sauce with it, so ends up tasting a little drybottom line; a lot of hype for something you can probably get in any italian deli in SF; i don&#39;t go here anymore and i live less than a block from here, that should tell you it&#39;s just okay, and not worth waiting in line

Amazing little Italian Deli. Great sandwiches and other deli items. I adore the homemade ravioli and tomato sauce. I got some for a dinner party a while back and my friends loved them both! Just be careful not to overcook them.

The sanwiches are sooo good! I love the green zesty sauce they use on them. I buy a cup of that stuff just so i can put it on the sanwiches i make at home. the people that work here are really cool too. At lunch the wait can be a little long but it&#39;s worth it! My favorite deli.

The previous reviews give enough detail. I just wanted to give this place 5 stars. Great acme bread, JARLSBERG cheese, deli meat is fantastic tasting and fresh. Only downside is service is a little slow, but the sandwiches can&#39;t be beat.

when i worked in the Marina, I always bought sandwiches here. good quality Italian deli meats and cheeses on fresh rolls. what&#39;s not to like? I also remember the pasta salad made with fusilili, sun dried tomatoes, garlic, grated romano and olive oil as a great offering here. time for a revisit soon!

An authentic Italian deli, with great meats, excellent sandwiches, and various other delicacies. Sometimes requires a little patience at lunchtime as the place is pretty small and the line can back up quickly. Friendly service, staff seem to know most of the customers.

This place is great! If you&#39;re looking for lunch or some imported italian goodness, stop in to Lucca&#39;s. They have all the deli meats that you want and they&#39;ll even import special orders for you. Make sure you stop in for a sandwich - they&#39;re damn good.

This place has excellent sandwiches and all of the Italian goodies that you need. Have time on your hands if you&#39;re heading in there, it can be pretty old school and slow at times, but worth the wait. The deli/fresh pastas are scrumpsch as well.

Great sandwiches wish it weren&#39;t in the Marina. Probably Joe Di Maggio&#39;s favorite sandwich place when he lived around the corner in the (1950s?), so I heard from an old Sicilian guy.. Go on a weekday.

Lucca is easily the best deli in the bay area, from what I can tell. I&#39;m a huge fan of &#34;roast beef and swiss, mustard and mayonnaise only, on sourdough&#34; and I measure any deli I visit by how well they make that sandwich. If you&#39;re a fan of roast beef and sourdough, you will not be disappointed. The ACME sourdough is extremely highly recommended if you like the really crusty genuine sourdough rolls, and the roast beef is tender and quite rare. Not sure what kind of swiss they put on the sandwich since I never ask, but it is also very good. Even the mayonnaise is good, and they DO use yellow mustard... only the best deli&#39;s use yellow mustard and not that dijon garbage.
