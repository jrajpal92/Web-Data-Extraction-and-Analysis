Great food. Their lamb rib chops are something else. We&#39;ve tried lamb chops at other afghan and middle eastern restaurants, but none come close theirs.The staff are knowledgable and guided us each time we visited. We were surprised to eat some splendid dishes that on paper don&#39;t make sense.

Had a Groupon that took me a while to use, since Russian Hill is pretty out of the way for me. But it was so worth the trek. I&#39;d never had Afghan before, and was expecting something similar to flavor profiles of various other parts of the world, but what I experienced was something entirely different! I had the veggie ravioli, which was incredibly delicious, and extremely filling. Would definitely return, with or without a deal!

Integrity is the first word that comes to mind when I think of Helmand Palace.Full disclosure: I waitressed for this restaurant back in &#39;99, when it was located on Broadway. I was simultaneously working at another extremely popular North Beach eatery and the difference was night and day. Helmand&#39;s kitchen was pristine and all the food was prepared with the utmost care. Our manager had us all arrive early for our shifts and sit down together for a family style meal before any guests arrived. I have very fond memories of my time there.That said; I am uber impressed with the current state of affairs in their newish incarnation. The flavors are as incredible as I remembered and the service is as soft, subtle and elegant as you might find in much pricier restaurants.Try the kaddo - a silky sweet pumpkin appetizer with a slightly sour yogurt sauce that balances the flavor profile perfectly. It is great with or without beef.The aushak is another delicious appetizer. It&#39;s a bit like ravioli without the marinara.All of the entrees I have tried have been delicious, but dessert is always particularly exquisite. They make it all in-house. The baklava and rice pudding are delectable.It was pretty empty on a Thursday night...I hope this place hangs in there as it offers this undeserving city an incredible culinary experience.

Great service and food.There. I&#39;m done with that review. :DWe decided to order a bunch of appetizers, so we got the aushak (&#34;raviolis&#34;), mantwo, kaddo, and aush (homemade noodle soup with beef and yogurt). Actually, everything had yogurt and beef soup. Which was perfectly fine...everything tasted great. The prices were extremely reasonable. Comfortable atmosphere, and like I mentioned, great service and food. What&#39;s not to like? Definitely recommended!

My experience here was nothing short of fantastic. They deliver in every single way: ambiance, service, food and price.I&#39;ve been eyeing a visit to Helmand Palace for weeks now, as I work just blocks away. Yesterday, 3/22/16, I happened to have a dental appointment at 6:30pm in the area, and it gave me the perfect opportunity to eat here beforehand. Best decision ever! The service here was top notch from the moment I walked in to the moment I walked out. Though I did come around the time they opened, people were already walking in left and right, yet they always kept their composure and were attentive to everyone.Well what about the food? It&#39;s not all about the service, right? The food was good too? YES! It was better than good. It was some of the best Afghan food that I&#39;ve tasted in over a year.I ordered 2 appetizers and 2 entree dishes. The two appetizers were the Aushuk (Ravioli filled w/ leeks &amp; scallions, served on sauce of yogurt, mint, &amp; garlic) and the Laghatac (Eggplant sauteed w/ onion, tomatoes, pepper, garlic, &amp; turmeric). I will say this: I could have ate just that and walked out completely satisfied. That is how good it was. I won&#39;t even spoil the rest. The two entree dishes I ordered were the Mourgh Challow (Chicken breast sauteed w/ spices &amp; yellow split-peas, then sauteed w/ yogurt, cilantro, &amp; curry served w/ challow) and the Koufta Challow (Beef meatballs w/ Afghan seasoning sauteed w/ sun-dried tomato, hot peppers, &amp; green peas in a fresh tomato sauce. Served w/ challow rice). I don&#39;t even know what adjactives or words to use to describe how amazing all four dishes were. I will just say that it was one of the best meals I&#39;ve had in a while. Also, you really can&#39;t beat what you&#39;re getting for how much you&#39;re paying. They have a Groupon that gives you about $20 worth of food for $12, so you save $8 off the bat. So worth it.Final verdict: When you have a place that truly cares about good service and tasty food it usually is a recipe for success, and this place absolutely does that. Every step of the way you can tell that this isn&#39;t just a restaurant that you walk in a have a quick bite to eat. It&#39;s an experience and a slow process, which isn&#39;t a bad thing. Food takes time to make because the cooking process is intricate. You&#39;re getting top quality ingredients and you can tell that from the first bite you take. A definite must visit in San Francisco.

Normally I don&#39;t eat at restaurants on Van Ness but I thought i would try this place. I was pleasantly surprised by the food and service.The food was delicious and the service was good.The only thing I didn&#39;t like was how silent the place was. I did come early so perhaps this is the reason, but I could hear everyone&#39;s conversations so I almost felt like I had to whisper.Nice place, nice service, good food, kind of in a random location.

Afghani food is some of my favorite food. For those of you that haven&#39;t tried it, it&#39;s a little bit similar to Indian food (but probably not the kind you&#39;re used to at Indian restaurants).Our waiter was friendly and really helpful. He recommended the kaddo as an appetizer, and it was amazing! I never thought roasted pumpkin could taste like that. Oddly enough, it kind of tasted like mango chutney. They also give you bread to start off with and a trio of sauces (and the bread is actualy warm!) The tomato sauce was surprisingly spicy, but not overwhelming. The yogurt was my favorite. The cilantro was good too, but a little vinegary. I wish we saved more of the bread to eat with the pumpkin.I ordered the chicken kabob with pallow, and it came with spinach and roasted vegetables. The pallow was really flavorful and delicious, but the chicken was a little over cooked and bland.We also ordered the lamb challow. Now I don&#39;t usually like lamb, but this was actually really good! The meat wasn&#39;t tough at all, and challow was really flavorful too. Also, this came with more kaddo!I definitely recommend the kaddo, and maybe skipping over the kabobs to order something that&#39;s a little bit harder to find at some of the other Persian restaurants in the city.

Came for a birthday dinner on a Monday night, so it wasn&#39;t crowded at all.Since it was my first time trying Afghani food, I can&#39;t say that I have much to compare it to. Overall, it was delicious and honestly just reminded me a lot of Indian food.I enjoyed all the dishes that was recommended to us - from the lamb to the pumpkin to the eggplant to the beef. We had one other dish, but I don&#39;t quite remember it! The waitress didn&#39;t try to get us to over-order food, which I appreciated. When we finished our portions, we thought we weren&#39;t full and made the mistake of ordering one more entree. We ended up having leftovers!Between five people, our total bill was about $65! They let us split the bill 5 ways as well, which was very convenient.I would definitely come back for a chill night with friends to eat slowly + have good conversation. It is not only reasonably priced, but the ambiance of it is homey and cozy with its blue arm chairs.

Delicious! Everything we ate was super flavorful. We got both the Vegetarian Aushak and Vegetarian Mantwo for appetizers, which wasn&#39;t really necessary because they&#39;re pretty similar. I love that there&#39;s a whole page of veg options (woohoo!) and opted for the Special so that I could try a little of everything (pumpkin, eggplant, spinach, okra, and pallow - rice with cardamom, cinnamon, and nutmeg). The pumpkin was my favorite - it could have been dessert. But since we&#39;re gluttons, we did get dessert: rice pudding, which I&#39;m typically not a fan of, but the cardamom was a nice touch.The service wasn&#39;t super attentive and the decor could use a revamp, but the food will keep me coming back, especially since it&#39;s reasonably priced. Even though there was no wait on a Friday at 7, since I noticed they do free delivery I&#39;ll probably do that next time.

I really wanted to like this place, but it isn&#39;t one that stands out for me in the array of fun and flavorful restaurants in SF.Ambiance: Came in on a Wednesday evening around 8:30 with a party of 4. The ambiance was quiet (a little too much, tbh), classy and quaint. The music was great, and this spot would definitely make for a cute, romantic date night.Service: The staff was excellent -- welcoming, attentive and friendly.Food: To start, the bread and sauce spread was one of the best parts (tip: mix the yogurt with a little bit of the green sauce!).For apps, I had the Mantwo (homemade pastry shell filled w/ onion &amp; beef, served on yogurt &amp; topped w/ carrots, yellow split-pea, &amp; beef sauce). I would recommend passing on the Mantwo -- it was visually underwhelming and lacked flavor. I was expecting texture of the pastry shells to be crispy, but they were quite limp and didn&#39;t really go well with the dish.The highlight of the meal was definitely my main, the Seek Kabab plate (charbroiled leg of lamb marinated in puree of onion, sun-dried baby grapes, &amp; garlic, served w/ sauteed eggplant &amp; pallow rice). The lamb was exceptionally cooked, without too many flavors and spices overpowering the taste of the meat. The rice and eggplant were simple and cooked well, but not much to be excited about here.Overall, a great restaurant, but flavors in the appetizer and the sides just didn&#39;t do it for me.

The meal for four was very enjoyable. We chose to share four first courses and three second courses. The dessert menu is worth looking at too if you still have room. We tried Bucklawa and Sheerekh; both very good.There is complimentary bread and three dips. The chilli dip is hot. Our waitress kept our iced water glasses filled throughout the meal too.All the dishes were good but there were a few highlights. The pumpkin first course was beautifully sweet. The meat in the Seek Kabab was crispy charred on the outside and pink in the middle. The sauce for the Mourgh Challow was excellent.Also, try the Turkish Coffee as they didn&#39;t miss with the spices and it was a good finish to the meal.

The food definitely isn&#39;t as good as I remembered having a few years back. The chutneys were watery, but the bread was still tasty. The dishes we ordered were all just okay. The noodles were way overcooked in the soup and the other dishes were fine, but nothing memorable. I probably wouldn&#39;t come back.

I ordered take out and my salad order was missing ingredients. It was likely never finished and just packed away incomplete for pick up. The meal itself was OK, but cold, despite the fact I showed up at exactly the time they told m my order would be ready. The review is one star because the least a restaurant can do is have warm food ready for pick up and serve food with all ingredients.

Once again... Businesses that offer their discounted services on Groupon do not want to provide good customer service once they learn that you&#39;ve purchased their deal. Then what is the point of attracting new customers with discounts at all... Maybe I would&#39;ve been better off not even knowing about this place.On a Wednesday night, I walked into an empty place. My boyfriend was staying at work later, so I thought it would be nice to try out a new place by myself. I told my waitress that I have a Groupon for $20. She said that I can&#39;t use it as I came by myself. So asked her if I should leave? And she said I&#39;m afraid so (!!!!!) or you would have to order an additional entree. It turns out that their Groupon HAS to be used for a party of two or more...The place is empty for a reason. They definitely don&#39;t make you feel welcomed. I will never be coming back again and will make sure my friends know this too!

This is one of my favorite restaurants in San Francisco, yet I have never seen it too busy, and whenever I go, there are always many empty tables.My favorite dishes are Mourgh Challow and Seek Kebab. Mourgh Challow is like a chicken curry dish at an Indian restaurant. It has a milder taste, but still manages to pack a lot of flavor. The Seek Kebab basically consists of lamb skewers. They are grilled to perfection, and have none of the tang that sometimes characterizes lamb dishes. The sides for this dish are also great, though I don&#39;t remember what they are.The bread and dipping sauce that they give you at the beginning are also good. I particularly like the chili sauce. Be careful, though: it is quite spicy. If you accidentally have too much, the yogurt sauce will help put out the fire in your mouth.In a recent visit, four of us split three dishes and an appetizer. That was plenty of food, and did not end up being all that pricy.Overall, I highly recommend this place.

I live a few blocks from this restaurant and never really thought much of it. So glad I decided to finally try this neighborhood gem! The restaurant is highly underrated and I will definitely be coming back! I hardly review on Yelp!, but restaurants that are under appreciated like Helmand Palace definitely deserve the praise.We ordered the Vegetarian kaddo (must!), Vegetarian Aushak (ravioli dish filled with leeks, scallions served with a delectable mint, yogurt and carrot sauce) and a Vegetarian entree recommended to us by our waitress. The flavors were amazing! Perfect balance and blend of spices/flavors. For dessert we ordered the rice pudding topped with crumbled pistachio. It was just the right amount of sweetness! Not overly done at all. I cannot forget about the house bread and side dipping sauces. The spicy cilantro sauce was my favorite! Overall, the food, service and price point were great! My only regret is that I wish I had tried this place sooner! :-)

I&#39;ve never had Afghani food before, but after trying Helmand Palace I&#39;m a fan. We tried their vegetarian special plate that had a few different veggie dishes (including kaddo, roasted eggplant, okra and tomatoes, and spinach) with rice. Everything was super flavorful and very distinct from each other. My favorite was probably the eggplant, which had a great smoky flavor and was very silky and tender. The kaddo was also pretty good. We even asked them if they could put the meat sauce on it like the appetizer version has and they obliged, without even charging us!Our other entree was the lamb curry, which blew me away. It had a little kick to it but had a lot of delicious spices and flavors that I wasn&#39;t familiar with and kept me intrigued. Also helps that it was so rich and creamy. The lamb itself could have been more tender, but all in all my favorite part of the meal.Free pita-like bread with sauces to start. I&#39;d love to go back.

I love Afghan food, and it&#39;s nice there are so many places that offer it around the bay area. Dishes like mantoo and kado are amongst my favourites, but unfortunately.. I didn&#39;t find the flavours I was looking for here.The food tended on the bland side, to my surprise. I was really looking forward to the mantwo but I couldn&#39;t taste any flavour in it. I guess there was some meat in some dough with some peas and yogurt, but it was uninspiring.On top of that, service was really, really slow. We stayed until they closed (big party), but we also didn&#39;t get food for at least 30 mins after we ordered. A friend of mine went to the bathroom which was near the kitchen and saw some people fighting in there, which might have resulted in the meh food. I guess restaurants can have off-days -- but to be honest, that was a bit ridiculous.Well, at least we all got fed.

Afghani is my favorite food after eating at Helmand Palace. My husband and I bought a Groupon to try there food and we fell so much in love with it that we bought another Groupon on same place.I would go their on a date mostly because of the ambiance and light authentic music in the background. I love to eat in such places which has a delightful ambiance and light music it makes you calm while you are enjoying the delicious food.Our favorite was their Naan-e-Afghani(their Afghani bread). Vegetarian Aushak was delicious too. I am not really a fan of their kaddoo as it is too sweet for me instead I would order Banjan Challow or Pallow.

I love this place and go here as often as I can swing it. I&#39;ve tried a good chunk of the menu by now, from flavorful lamb rice plates to the delicious soups on the starter menu. If you&#39;re even remotely considering going here, read the menu- you&#39;ll see how mouthwatering it sounds and you will have to check it out!All of the dishes I&#39;ve tried are excellent: they taste fresh, lots of flavor, and unique spice profiles from what you find in a lot of other types of cuisine. There is a lot more lamb on their menu than you see at many other restaurants- I&#39;m actually not sure if that is a constant in Afghan cuisine or just their style, but I love it! They also have chicken and fish dishes though, as well as vegetarian options. We love getting the pumpkin Kaddo as a starter, or the Aushuk ravioli-like starter. For the main, I usually get the Qabelee with lamb or the Mourgh Challow chicken dish.Service is always good here too- I always feel like they&#39;re taking good care of us. The restaurant is sometimes buzzing, sometimes on the emptier side, but regardless I think the service is solid. They do take reservations if you want to plan ahead.Also: This is a great place to take people with eating restrictions. They have vegetarian sections in their menu, plus there&#39;s a lot of gluten-free options. They do make a lot of things with yogurt but I&#39;ve gone with someone who can&#39;t eat dairy and they could easily help her out, too.

I love this place...or at least, I used to. I&#39;ve ordered the Mourgh Challow pretty consistently over the last few years, but the last couple of times the quality has decreased dramatically. This dish used to be rich and flavorful with really good chunks of chicken breast. Lately, it has become watered down and tasteless with dry chunks of chicken. What happened?! This dish used to be soooo good, and now it is a huge disappointment. I really hope they fix this, but in the meantime I do not recommend ordering it. Hopefully the other dishes haven&#39;t suffered but that remains to be seen.

We (Me &amp; my wife) went to Helmand Palace and the food was delicious. Naan-e Afghani (Afghani bread) was the best I ever had. We ordered Vegetarian Aushak to start with, Kaddo and Banjan Challow for main course and Pallow as side dish. Everything was great and well cooked. If you don&#39;t like too much sweet then you can avoid Kaddo as it&#39;s a bit sweeter. They do have some good sauces. Prices are reasonable.We are soon visiting again.

Helmand Palace has some exceptional Afghani food. I visited this place for the first time a few months ago and I&#39;ve been back here three times since.I&#39;ve tried the Kourma Challow, Mourgh Slata and Quormay Ma-He, all three very flavourful with great seasoning. The Kourma Challow was my favourite dish with the lamb cooked to perfection.The place is never too crowded even on the weekends so it&#39;s great for a last minute meal. They stay open till 11pm on Friday and Saturday which is nice.However, the decor of the place is a little on the older side and could be improved. They do seem a little understaffed too.Overall, great food and courteous staff. Would definitely recommend it!

Recently, my bf and I came here for dinner on a Saturday night because it is one of his favorite restaurants. He used to live in the Marina and often dined here and more frequently ordered take out from here. Because I cannot have gluten, it can be challenging for us to find places that are safe for me to eat. I had a positive experience here, and we look forward to returning soon!Although I had made a reservation, it was not necessary on this particular night, as the restaurant was busy but not overly so. From the moment we walked in the door, I felt welcomed by the staff, and everyone who helped us was hospitable and kind.To start, we had the Banjan (eggplant with tomato and yogurt) and Kaddo (fried pumpkin seasoned with sugar and served with beef sauce). The eggplant was perfected seasoned, and the flavors were like a deconstructed eggplant parmesan, with the tomato and spice bringing out the best of the eggplant. The yogurt added a nice mellow balance. As for the Kaddo, I only had one bite of it because it was too sweet for my tastes -- the pumpkin without the sugar is sweet enough for me. My bf could not stop raving about it.We also split some Mashawa, a flavorful soup made with lamb, mung beans, chick peas, black-eyed peas, and yogurt. Even if I weren&#39;t already a pushover for lamb, I would say that this soup delivered. It was well seasoned and rich tasting without being heavy.For entrees, I had the Dwopiaza (leg of lamb with split peas), and my bf had the Chapendaz (tenderloin beef with grilled vegetables , lentils, mung beans, and spinach rice). I substituted a side of Bendi (okra with onions and tomato) for the accompanying rice. To quote the Lego Movie, &#34;Everything (was) awesome!&#34; My only snag was that my dish had some sort of flour-based unleaved bread not listed in the description hidden under my pile of lentils. Fortunately, I realized it was there right away and sort of quarantined that portion of my plate and avoided getting ill.We were more than full from all of the delicious food by that point, so we skipped dessert.Overall, I would recommend this restaurant to other gluten-free diners, but make sure to request that your dish not be served with any bread, even if you think it is safe as described.

Fantastically good. So many delicious meals here. A lot of people mention the Kaddo, it is awesome. I also love the beef, it is always well marinated and never over cooked. And really I never thought I&#39;d say this but their rice is amazing! Rice that isn&#39;t bland, it is rich and flavorful, worth eating on its own. Also the wait staff is always so nice. That is such a plus!

This restaurant has great ambience. I enjoyed the big framed portraits and the whole setup is impressive. The food the generally very healthy. It has been cooked to be good and good for you. Personally I like spicier Afghan food. I am sure many would find the food very tasty specially those who are into milder and lighter food. The prices are very good for SF even though the portions of meat and costlier ingredients are small. I really liked their house wine. It went well with the meat. I think a bit more saltier food could give us a bit more balance. So don&#39;t let my taste that has been all over the map through the my life, like going from loving fast food to not touching fast food, set your mind at anything about this possibly one of the greatest you may have experienced.

I was introduced to Helmand Palace by a good friend and fellow foodie who has lived in SF a lot longer than I have. Admittedly, this was his second choice for food from the Afghani / Northern Pakistani region, but it still ended up being quite a good one.We had a wide range of palates in our party -- I tend to favor spicier food, my partner prefers things quite mild, and my friend was probably somewhere in the middle. While I found the spiciness to be kind of lacking, they both really seemed to enjoy the balance. I don&#39;t really think this is anything bad about Helmand Palace, but rather is more about preferred taste.I can live with a lack of spice, as long as the food tastes good, and this did. I got the lamb and spinach, which was really wonderfully cooked and flavorful if not spicy. The sauces for dipping tasty tasty injera into were pretty good, but nothing incredible. The kaddo was particularly good though, and it seems like their appetizers are worth trying more of.The service was attentive and friendly -- and the atmosphere, as has been commented on often here, is both cozy and attractive. Anything that wasn&#39;t understood was graciously explained. Since I have a number of food allergies, including gluten and nightshades, I often have this existential dread about approaching the topic with more traditional establishments... but this was not the case with Helmand Palace. Our server went back to ask the chef directly, and pointed me towards alternatives where needed.While our meal was by no means cheap, it seemed like a good deal for the money, especially in this neighborhood. I&#39;m a fan, and will return. That said, I&#39;m still looking for that whiz-bang kick-my-butt Afghan experience. Helmand Palace just didn&#39;t quite deliver, and thus gets a still quite passable four stars.

If you are Afghan this place may not be the place for you. While I appreciated the effort to try to present the food in an artistic culinary manner, the beauty of Afghan food is in its bounty. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I am not saying to give a huge pile of food on a plate, but Afghan food is best presented with a plentiful serving to fill the plate.Additionally, the seasoning was completely dull. I ordered khorma ghosth and it was very bland as was the kabob. The salat e afghani was decent.For an Afghan used to authentic cooking and spices, this place missed it by quite a bit.

We&#39;ve been traveling to SF every few months for medical appointments at UCSF for our youngest, and often stay overnight in order to make everything easier. This round we stayed at the Castle Inn Motel and looked about for some interesting place to meet a friend for dinner. Yelp reviews to the rescue; the Helmand Palace is within walking distance of our motel, and friend had spent time long long ago in Afghanistan, so, hey.Plus, vegetarian options!! Lots of them, not just the &#34;okay, now maybe we can have baked potatoes and salad&#34; foraging that sometimes happens.Each of us (there were five of us) ordered a different dish and we really did intend to share, but...well, we were all gluttonous and so happy with what we had that we didn&#39;t. The oft mentioned pumpkin dish is indeed delicious. The bread and sauces served before dinner are delightful (my fav was the yogurt with cucumbers and a touch of...some delicious herb or spice. Cool, refreshing, yummy). Everyone was happy, everyone cleaned his or her plate. My friend and I had Turkish coffee, even though the waitress warned it would keep us up all night--friend had to drive back to Santa Cruz and I have excellent caffeine tolerance. Delicious: thick, sweetened, brewed with cardamom.The ambiance is very pleasant--beautiful blue lights, comfortable chairs, interesting paintings.I would very gladly return. With drinks, coffee, and a shared appetizer our bill was less than 20 dollars a person.And the waitress was charming.

Wow! When lil ham told me for Afghani I was skeptical. I didnt have the slightest clue what the food would be like and if there would even be people in the restaurant!The food was amazing! Its so unique, lots of interesting flavours. The restaurant itselfhas a really cozy vibe. We had the veg combo entree, meatballs and the BAKLAVA. All the food was amazing but the Baklava was out of this world. Get it SO good.VERY comfortable chairs--big plus in my books!Give this place a try, you won&#39;t regret it

I have to admit Afghani is not the first urge I have to purge when it comes to a dining experience in our fair city, but once again, I was swayed by another &#34;Check, Please! Bay Area&#34; episode where Helmand Palace received a mixed reaction from the three guests. Regardless, what drew me to the place was the idea of a cuisine that mixed Indian sauces and spices with a Mediterranean-style focus on lamb and meat sauces. Sounded like a culture clash I could thoroughly enjoy, and besides, I&#39;m always up for a new cuisine as long as it doesn&#39;t move. Now Jamie W. took some cajoling, but I convinced him that meat was involved, so he was game.With the walls covered liberally in what I assume to be pieces of exotic Afghani art, the restaurant was bigger than I expected, so we had no problem getting a table on an early Friday evening around 6:30PM. Almost immediately, we were served their special flatbread (called Obi Non) and three dipping sauces that looked like the Italian flag - a light green one with cilantro, a white yogurt sauce, and a red one which was a bit on the hot side (see photo). Good stuff to dip and nibble on as we waited for our appetizers. The first to arrive was the $6.95 Mantwo, homemade pastry shells filled with sauteed beef and onion, served in yogurt and topped with carrots, yellow split peas and beef sauce (see photo). It tasted almost Italian, so of course, we liked it.The second was actually a veggie side dish, the $5.95 Bendi, okra sauteed with onions, tomatoes and garlic. Pretty tasty except I wish we had more of the obi non to scoop up the drippy sauce. The entrees were solid, though Jamie ordered the better one of the two, the $16.95 Lawand, which are tender chunks of leg of lamb sauteed with onions, tomatoes, garlic, mushrooms, cilantro, capers and hot peppers, all of it covered in a yogurt sauce that reminded me of korma. It came with challow rice and sauteed spinach (see photo). That was a tasty, hearty dish with just the right amount of spice. Mine was more on the bland side, the $14.95 Seek Kabab, which is a char-broiled leg of lamb chunked and marinaded in onions, sun-dried baby grapes and garlic. Very tender and moist.It came with a side of sauteed eggplant (too mushy for my taste) and pallow rice (see photo). This one was hearty as well but tasted like more like a grandma dish if you know what I mean. Gee, you&#39;d think we were finished by then, but we felt a little dessert was still in order. They&#39;re only $4.95 each anyway. I knew Jamie had his eye on the Bucklawa, which was a generous slice of baklava with the addition of walnuts, almonds and cloves on top of the expected pistachios and cinnamon, all of it bathing in gooey honey caramel (see photo). Delish and as excessive as you would expect. I was equally predictable and ordered the Sheerberaing, a scoop of rice pudding with pistachios and cardamon (see photo). Just right for me.. and so alas, is this place.FOOD - 4 stars...hearty lamb dishes are quite good and filling with standout desserts to bootAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...more spacious than you would expect in this area and relatively quietSERVICE - 3.5 stars...on the quiet side, more recommendations and explanations would have been helpfulTOTAL - 4 stars...worthy of a return visit to try some of their veggie options

In my quest to explore vegetarian dishes in exotic cuisines, I found myself wandering into Helmand Palace, one fine evening. I was new to Afghan cuisine and didn&#39;t know what to expect going in. But when I looked at the menu, I realized that most vegetarian items on the menu were variations of Indian and Mediterranean food (which I guess, sort of makes geographic sense). I had the Vegetable Kourma Challow which is a platter of mixed vegetables cooked in flavorful spices, along with spinach and served with what looked like a mild variation of the Indian Pulao. The food was well prepared, and in general the service was excellent. But the real kicker for me was the complimentary bread and chutneys. The Afghan bread was soft, fluffy and so delectably tasty. And eating that with the three different types of chutneys they had is an experience worth undertaking! Will I go there again? Hell yeah!

Another great place to dine at on Russian Hill.We wanted to try Afghan food and stopped by Helmand Palace on a rainy evening.The place is bigger than it looks in the pictures, it&#39;s dimly lit, charming, nicely decorated, elegant. Perfect for a nice dinner out.We got seated immediately. Service is good here. We ordered a half carafe of their house red (French)- good and reasonable. They brought these amazing bread from the house and 3 dipping sauces (a red-hot one, a yogurt one- tzatziki type and a cilantro one)- all delicious. Nice and generous.I got the Mourgh Kabab (charbroiled marinated chicken breast, served with sauteed spinach and pallow). I loved the flavor of the chicken and enjoyed trying their pallow rice. I&#39;m not a huge fan of spinach, but they did a different spin on it, so it was very tasty. My husband got their Kofta Kabab (ground, grilled beef mixed with green onions, cilantro, garlic)- it&#39;s mouth watering, just delicious. It comes with sauteed eggplant (loved it) and challow rice. Everything is fresh. This could be a great place if you&#39;re a vegetarian, too.We had baklava so many times, so we weren&#39;t keen on ordering it, but a few people at a near by table got it and were raving about it. So we shared one! If you dine here you have to get their baklava! It&#39;s their Afghan twist on your classic one and it&#39;s so good, different, with cardamon sprinkled on top. The best baklava I ever had!We loved our experience at Helmand Palace! It was our favorite meal while we were in San Francisco. We would go back there in a heartbeat!

Do not be deterred by its slightly off-brand location; Helmand Palace is consistently great. A few favorite dishes are the kaddo (the pumpkin dish everyone talks about), the seek kabab, the lawand, and the baklava. The wine list is good with reasonable prices.The staff is also really accommodating. We had our wedding rehearsal dinner here last year with about 30 people. It went off without a hitch, and our guests are still talking about how good the food was months later.Even though I ate here last night, writing this review makes me want to go back again tonight. Mmm, lamb dishes...

For personal reasons, our visit to Helmand Palace was way overdue but our Afghan feast was way satisfying.Owned by Mahmoud Karzai, brother of Afghan president Hamid Karzai, Helmand Palace does a nice job at showcasing the nuanced flavors of Afghan cuisine resulting in a lovely balance between sweet, savory, and aromatic spices. All meals begin with fresh baked bread and a trio of lovely chutneys and yoghurt. Dining family style, we started with a couple of appetizers - the Kaddo fried then baked pumpkin (both the regular and vegetarian options) and the Aushak leek and scallion ravioli with meat sauce. Ok... y&#39;all need to order the pumpkin. The vegetarian version is great with the garlic yoghurt sauce balanced with some sugar for sweetness but the regular version with the meat sauce is just divine. The balance of the spices is incredible and the meatiness is enhanced with what I suspect to be cinnamon, cloves, or five spice. The ravioli comes with the same meat sauce which made the otherwise unremarkable pasta delicious.For entrees, we ordered the Qabelee rice baked with lamb shanks, raisins, and carrots , the Koufta Challow beef meatballs, and a side of Dall. The beef meatballs were decent but unmemorable. I would skip that dish. Now the lamb shanks however were incredibly tender and the whole dished was flavorful and well composed. The Dall was smooth and well-seasoned. All in all, it was a warm and hearty meal.Service is really sweet and attentive here. No worries if this is your first foray into Afghan cuisine, the servers will offer recommendations when asked. The decor feel authentic but is a little rundown. My chair kept getting stuck in a tear in the carpet. Regardless though, Helmand Palace is a great place to come if you&#39;re looking for something a little different for dinner.

I have been going to Helmand for years and hosted a party at my house for 100 people over july 4th weekend. I catered all the food from Helmand -The owner Haysan came in several hours early to prepare the food himself!..he had it all packaged in large banquet containers and even helped load it into the car himself..!!We had the Qabelee (chunks of lean lamb shanks in a sweet rice), Sabzi Challow (lamb with sauteed spinach), the Banjan (eggplant with tomatoes, garlic yoghurt), Gulpea (cauliflower with turmeric and other spices) and lastly the amazing Kaddo which i consider a dessert (sweet pumpkin with a savory meat sauce).My guests are still raving about the food (and they all left with a menu)..so my advice..get there before this local gem gets bombarded by my closest 100 friends...and think of them for your next corporate or private event...top marks and a huge thank you Haysan!!

First time trying Afghan food, and I have to say, not bad. Not bad at all :) It&#39;s similar to Indian, but milder I would say. The spices aren&#39;t as in your face like cumin, etc.Though this is a tablecloth restaurant, the prices are actually quite reasonable. Usually between $10-18 per dish, maybe around $13 on average per dish.Save some room for the free warm, fresh flatbread they serve in the beginning with three sauces. Tasted like a yogurt, tomato/chili, and cilantro-y green sauce. So yums, which I had more room in my stomach!We had the kaddo to start, which was good, but didn&#39;t exactly blow my mind. It was quite a sweet pumpkin paired with a ground beef (like bolognese) sauce. Interesting, but don&#39;t think I loved it as much as some of the other Yelpers.All the dishes were very palatable; I don&#39;t think you could go wrong ordering anything here. Even the lamb was not too game-y and had a rather mild flavor. The sauces were all very interesting and tasty, although I think we ordered one too many dishes with the ground beefy tomato sauce (reminded me of bolognese pasta sauce). This was on the Aushak, Kaddo, and Mantwo, which you can get as an appetizer or entree.The Mourgh Challow is a like a milder version of Chicken Tikka Masala, so very safe if this is your first time trying Afghan cuisine. However, I would say that Helmand Palace is the restaurant to be adventurous with Afghan cuisine, because they cook all their dishes really well.Though the portions were quite hefty and I ate around three pieces of flatbread, I surprisingly almost finished everything we ordered, proving just how good the food was.Bonus: they split the bill four ways with four credit cards and didn&#39;t complain. Awesome!

Superb food, good service and a quiet, spacious dining area!! The kaddo (pumpkin) is a real treat. The blended eggplant salad was also quite good. The leek raviolis were delicate and in a delicious sauce. But the salmon kabob was clearly the best of all; expertly marinaded and succulent.Parking is difficult, even on a week night. However, the restaurant has an arrangement with Walgreens at Polk &amp; Broadway, a few blocks away. We parked on the street after a long search, unaware of the Walgreens deal until afterwards.The neighborhood is uninviting and noisy, so don&#39;t expect to take a pleasurable after-meal stroll. For some unexplained reason, drivers in this neighborhood seem to have been imported from NYC; lots of impatient horn blasting and fast driving. Drivers in other parts of SF seem considerably more sane.

I can honestly say that I have never had rice delivered to me that was so good. Fluffy, not oily, just perfect.Excellent!

The Helmand serves great Afghan food. The prices are okay and they do serve wine.I&#39;ve been eating here since their last location. Parking situation is not great so be prepared to park wherever and walk (but that&#39;s most places in SF). There is valet parking for a small cash fee.I think most people will be surprised by the taste. Afghan food is fusion...true beauty.These are the items on the menu that you MUST try at least once and when you do, you&#39;ll be hooked:1) Kadoo with meat sauce2) Mantwo3) Mourgh ChallowYou will not be disappointed.

A small place with ample seating; the wait staff is nice and accommodating. The decor is classical.Good appetizers:- The Ashak was tender and had a good balance of meat and yogurt.- The Kaddo, baked pumpkin with meat sauce, is an interesting take on mixing sweet and savory. The pumpkin is flavorful and sweet.Entrees were good as well. We shared 4 dishes between 5 people:- Kafta kabob: tender skewered meat with flavorful blend of spices and served with challow rice- Vegetarian platter: included the kaddo with eggplant, okra, and spinach- Lawand: you know it was lamb, but wasn&#39;t too gamy. It&#39;s served with a cream sauce that was great to eat with the rice.- Seek kabob: tasty morsels of meat.Desserts:- Baklava: this version had a dense layer of nuts and caramelized sugar (my mom&#39;m fav)- Rice pudding: not overly spiced by the cardamom, yet creamy and subtle.

Five stars for uniqueness!Seriously, when was the last time you had pumpkin kadoo, or lamb braised seven different ways.This place is a tasty treat and not your normal fare. The trick is to focus on the appetizers: basically order all of them (and as people mention, they go great with the free and tasty warm bread).For the main course, just decide what meats you like and go with those. You don&#39;t have to eat lamb, but...

Ordered delivery through Yelp on a weeknight, which was great because I&#39;ve missed being able to order anything I want online through Seamless in New York.I split two dishes with my girlfriend:- Kaddo and Banjan Challow Vegetarian Entree (pumpkin with yogurt sauce and eggplant with tomato sauce) - pumpkin was pretty good, but not what we were expecting, it&#39;s separated from the main dish and pretty sweet. eggplant was absolutely incredible, best afghan we&#39;ve had.- Aushak Vegetarian Entree (ravioli filled with leeks and scallions) - wow, this has some serious flavor. definitely give it a try, you&#39;ll be blown back with each bite.

I&#39;d give this place 4.5 if I could. The service was great, even though they had a party of about 20 come in. The food terrific, especially liked my pumpkin dish (don&#39;t remember the name). It is really great that they have so many veggie options. Wish I lived here so I could go back often.

The okra are the best okra I have tried. They have some special spices that make them amazing. Both the vegetarian and non-vegetarian version of the Aushak are really tasty.

Helmand Palace is excellent, authentic, and welcoming. As someone with a lot of dietary restrictions, I appreciated the flexibility of the cuisine and the staff&#39;s willingness to help. My father and I stopped in on a whim and it was one of the best meals we had on our trip.Many people have had food similar to Afghani cuisine, but the pumpkin dishes will surprise many and are heavenly. I cannot recommend it highly enough, especially for vegans and vegetarians.

To the friend who made an executive decision...fantastic choice!With a reasonable price point ($15-$20), a soothing ambiance, and friendly staff, this was a solid dinner choice to break up a work week diet of Trader Joe frozen meals.My Lawand (Leg of Lamb stewed in a delicious sauce) served with spinach and Challow rice was fabulous. The lamb was fork slicing tender and the side sauces ensured I took the p90x approach of &#34;Taste Bud Confusion&#34;. Obscure reference...probably :)Try some Afghan food! You won&#39;t regret it.

I love this place! It is right in Russian Hill on Van Ness. From the outside, it looks like a quick take out place, but as soon as you walked in, you will be surprised by the nice white table cloth. The food is absolutely delicious! We had Aushak and Mantow as appetizers. Though both are some kinds of ravioli with yummy sauces, they tasted so different and yet equally irresistible. I almost wanted to lick the place. I am glad I didn&#39;t because otherwise I won&#39;t have room for the main course. I ordered seek (lamb) kabab. It is nothing fancy, just fresh ingredients and simple preparation, and the end result is juicy and tasty lamb that I cannot have enough of. Another thing that is very special about this place is the Turkish coffee. They roll out a cart to prepare it right in front of you. This is such a wonderful gem and I highly recommend it!

This was the best surprise package I found in SFO!! Delicious food, great service and quiet ambiance made for an excellent dining experience.We ordered their special entree that had kaddo (which was the best pumpkin dish I have ever had), pan-fried eggplant (again a pleasure for your taste-buds), pallow (rice dish) and okra and spinach dishes which were delectable. We also had their Aushak, and Aush - both were outstanding!Baklava at Hemland&#39;s was the best I have ever had, and it tasted even better with their Turkish coffee! I would strongly recommend this place to anyone who has not tried Afghani cuisine before, and also to everyone who is looking for a fine dining experience in the city of SFO!!

The food here is delicious and so worth trying especially if you have never had Afgran food. The kadoo is my favorite, and the lamb and kebab dishes are awesome. The service is good and everyone is very pleasant.The only thing that keeps me from going more often is that parking can be a real pain. Other than that it is a pretty fabulous meal.

I first started eating at Helmand in the year 2004 when it was located on Broadway St and then followed it to its current location on Van Ness Ave. It&#39;s one of the best and my favorite restaurants I have come to know in San Francisco. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone because their food tastes so good, reasonably priced and the service is excellent! Thank you Helmand Palace for serving afghan food in San Francisco!

Terrible - we ordered through Caviar mistaking this place for another wonderful kabob restaurant. I ordered the chicken kabob and the yogurt salad with cucumber, parsley and mint. Salad was very runny. Because I cook Indian food myself, which is similar to many Afghani dishes, especially the rice, I expect richly flavored rice when it&#39;s advertised as such. This rice was very bland and more like Rice-A-Roni out of a box. I prepare a variety of rice dishes ranging from coconut to saffron to those with curry leaves - I use fresh quality spices and often grind them myself. The result is fragrant and delicious rice - each and every one is different. This was flavorless. The chicken, though, was the biggest disappointment of all. We got exactly four pieces of chicken, each about an inch wide and the length of my ring finger or pinky. Total. The other place we order from offers mountains of delicious saffron rice and two! REAL full length kabobs (about 14&#34; X 2) of chicken per dinner plate plus plenty of veggies - it is always enough to share or have leftovers. This was a joke. There was exactly one piece of green pepper, two tiny bits of onion, and one segment of a tomato. The spinach was a dubious frozen spinach concoction that my son left on his plate and I ate with regret. Yuck. Even the bread seemed to be from a package. Never again. There was a lot of watery liquid at the bottom of the takeout container which another reviewer also commented on below.

The aromas are enough to make you salivate.The flavors make you squirm in your seat with delight.The service is top drawer, really top drawer.The decor is smart and cute, not stuffy. It&#39;s enough to make it feel cozy and romantic while being casual.The location is perfect and centrally located.Honestly, I don&#39; t even know what to say. Every single thing I ordered was so damn delicious. I&#39;ll certainly be making this a stop on my list of places to return to when I&#39;m in town. Go there on a date or with a friend, enjoy some wine, enjoy each others company. But don&#39;t go there for a meeting, or for some reason that requires a lot of talking because your mouth will be filled with beautiful flavors, you won&#39;t have time to babble so much.

I&#39;ve tried out several entrees here, but none of them compare to the kaddo. Here&#39;s what you should kno about the kaddo (hah!):- It&#39;s a baked sugar pumpkin covered in a 1-2-sauce-punch. Starts with savory meat sauce, and then hits you upside the head with a tangy yogurt sauce.- The sauce combo makes for a really wild combination of flavors, I haven&#39;t had anything like it before.- It&#39;s supposed to be an appetizer/side, but you can totally order two of them and make a meal of it.The waitstaff is incredibly friendly and efficient. I&#39;ve never had to wait for seating here.

They also know what we usually order. I tend to get lamb dishes, which are all great. My favorite is the Lowand. The Dwopiaza is also super amazing. The Bucklawa is literally out of this world in its goodness. It must be tried when you go there.

I made reservations to go but I would say it&#39;s not usually difficult to get seated. Service was great and food was amazing. I had the Kaddo appetizer and it was bomb. I also tried the lamb chops and they were delicious (even though I do not usually eat lamb) they are a must mmm. I also had their Theeka kabab prime rib beef plate and it was amazing, meat was tender, juicy and had a great flavor. Also, the sauces and bread are delicious, I wish I could take them home. Price is affordable especially for the the amazing food quality.P.S: A day later I went to Kokkari estatorio a very popular greek restaurant but I have to say Helmand is better in every way and it&#39;s much cheaper.

Went back again the next night to try more.The atmosphere is quiet, intimate. The pumpkin appetizer was the best thing I&#39;ve had in a looong time. The bread was super yummy. Really, everything I tried was great. The service at times was not the best, but the food totally made up for it.

Great place and there&#39;s nothing lousy on the menu, both vegetarians and meat eaters have awesome options available to them here. They go for a more formal dining setting and it shows since it&#39;s a bit expensive. With arestaurant.comcoupon -- which they&#39;ve recently stopped accepting -- you can take the edge off it. I have trouble remembering the dish names, but most of the meat dishes come with rice pilaf, vegetables, and bread. Some of the dishes like the Mantwo are standalone.I do like this place, but now that they don&#39;t take those coupons anymore, it may be a bit too expensive for my blood going forward.

I discovered this place throughrestaurant.com. This was the second time I&#39;d had Afghan food, and it was amazing the first time, so I was really looking to have my socks blown off. Boy, did I.There was a group of seven of us, and we came hungry. This place delivered on all counts. The bread they serve is good, and comes with three different sauces. Try them all; they are flavorful and delicious.We ordered the Kaddo for an appetizer, which is baked pumpkin with a little bit of sugar. It was delicious! I love pumpkin dishes, and this was really tasty! I wished I didn&#39;t have to share it with six other people, but ah, such is life.For my entree, I got the Dwopiaza, which is leg of lamb with mushrooms and daal. The first time I had Afghan food, I was suffering from a lack of things other than meat. I made sure to avoid that this time by ordering mushrooms and daal. This was really, really good. It was just the right combination of items that really complemented each other.We had the baklava for dessert, but it was a little too dense and sweet, considering how heavy of a dinner we&#39;d just had. As soon as I can get more coupons for this place, I am buying a bunch and saving them for a rainy day. What a delicious discovery!

This place was a treat! Didn&#39;t make it to desserts because the appetizers, and entree were so filling! Everything was good here. I had the Deygee Kabab. The sweet pumpkin was delicious! I wish I could have taken just extra of that side to go.Prices are reasonable, around $15 per entree. More or less depending on the dish.Service was great; they&#39;ve got a friendly staff whom are not only personable, but knowledgeable, and fast to serve.Parking was rough, I circled for about 15 minutes on a Thursday night. It&#39;s right on Van Ness.Definitely worth trying though!

My husband and I went to this place after a Flamenco show at Pena Pechamama, because we really wanted to eat some good food and not just all vegan. So we stopped here and glad we did. The server was really sweet and asked a bit about us, we had a great short conversation with him. The manager was making sure we had a good time and was more than happy to make my husbands dish as he asked mixing two meats instead of just lamb or beef. I loved the tri dip with the warm lavash bread. Overall we had a lovely time and definitely will be back!

The food was good, nothing too special or unique, but tasty overall. The pumpkin (Kaddo) was a standout. However, we left hungry and didn&#39;t feel it was worth ordering more for the price. The restaurant was empty when we went but service was still slow for some reason. I felt like the restaurant was a lot &#34;dressier&#34; than it needed to be - very white tablecloth.

Man San Fran, you make Atlanta look like chumps when it comes to options. Afghan food?!?! Good Afghan food!??! Get outta here.You know when you go to any Indian restaurant, and the food tastes muddled and uninspired. Or Chinese? Or particularly Mediterranean. It&#39;s all tired and cookie-cutter in preparation. When I stepped in the door at Helmand, that&#39;s exactly what I expected. The interior is a throwback to at least the early 80&#39;s and the servers wear old school waitron uniforms - but that&#39;s where the mundane normalcy stops.If you skim the reviews on this page, you&#39;ll see 9/10 yelpers recommend the Kaddo - they don&#39;t lie. That was probably the single most interesting bite I had in SF. Sweetened pumpkin lies atop yogurt and is covered with meat sauce. So many assertive yet complimentary flavors distinctly serve their purpose in this app.As far as the other dishes are concerned, I&#39;d get something (anything) with lamb. It seems to me you can&#39;t go wrong at Helmand Palace and that&#39;s why it&#39;s deserving of 5 stars. They offer delicious Afghani food at moderate prices. The service is warm and friendly and your heart, mind and stomach will leave happy.

I&#39;ve walked past Helmand Palace for months without any thought of trying it. That was a mistake.I ordered carry-out food from their website this evening after realizing it was getting too late to start cooking myself. The food was ready promptly when I arrived to pick it up, and he inside of the restaurant was lively and clean with a good crowd.I followed the recommendations online and ordered the kaddo appetizer. It was delicious with a good balance between the pumpkin and garlic flavors.For an entree I ordered the seek kabob. It was also well prepared and flavorful. Tender, lean beef medallions and excellent sides.I&#39;ll definitely be back!

This Palace should get five stars across the board !I took my sweetheart on a four day get away to the bay area for her recent birthday.On our last night in The City, we took a little hike from our hotel up Lombard, over Russian Hill and to Helmand Palace.We are both big on our Middle Eastern cuisine so we were curious to try some Afghan fare in wonderful San Francisco.From the first bite of our cucumber, onion, cilantro and yogurt salad we were both sitting there with that look of just feeling your ecstasy kick in. In all seriousness, we were just amazed at the flavor. We also were served home made bread and three different sauces to taste, again blown away by flavors.I ordered a dish with meatballs and rice and she had a plate with lamb and spinach, I wish I could remember the names of the dishes but you will see them on the menu when you go taste for yourself the awesomeness of Helmand Palace.The quality and portion size you get for the money is unreal, I was shocked that the prices are so very reasonable.Anytime I&#39;m in SF I will make a point to eat here or, if I know of people going there, I will be sure to let them know it&#39;s a must try.

Helmand Palace is a dream come true! *Amazing* food, wine, service and overall experience.It&#39;s never overly busy (e.g. no issues with immediate seating) and the staff has the essence of &#34;just in time&#34; wine and food nailed. Diners aren&#39;t left sitting with their tummies grumbling or mouths parched -- but also aren&#39;t rushed or bothered by lurking waitstaff. The smells, the flavors and the ambiance come together to make Helmand Palace a delight.I really can&#39;t say enough positive things about this restaurant; if a potential patron is standing outside, perusing the menu, I always say a hearty &#34;you have to try it!&#34; as I walk on by.*NOTE: Restaurant does not open until 5:30 (dinner only)

I&#39;ve been here several times and have had their catering on several occasions. I can absolutely say that I have never had a bad dish. Everything is perfectly seasoned and plays delightfully with your taste buds after each bite. One thing you absolutely cannot miss is the kadoo. You might think that you don&#39;t like pumpkin, but you&#39;ve never tried this before! I would suggest it with the beef if you aren&#39;t a vegetarian because it adds a salty flavor to the sweet pumpkin, beautiful! I love their lamb dishes and have never been sad I got any of them. My advice is to choose an entree and stick with the sides that come with it, you won&#39;t be disappointed as they all work together perfectly!If you&#39;re in the mood, they do table-side Turkish coffee which is just a treat! I always wish that I was hungry enough for dessert, but I can never fit it it! I know the owner of this restaurant who is absolutely delightful and you get the impression that he is using his grandmother&#39;s recipes. Check it out!

I&#39;d mark this places as one of my hidden gems of San Francisco with 400+ reviews it&#39;s hard to say that this place is really hidden or a secret. No one in my circles talk about this place, which is a shame because it is absolutely delicious and a great value! For two people we shared the vegetarian sampler entree, the vegetarian aushak (ravioli) appetizer and a side of the daal. We were a little worried about not having enough food (I was really hungry going in) but the serving size was perfect. I highly recommend the vegetarian entree platter because the various dishes are all interesting and delicious. My favorite was the baked pumpkin but I wouldn&#39;t hold it against anyone claiming a different dish was theirs. Great food at a great price, check it out!

Oh this place is a win! I had never had Afghan cuisine. This was a nice entry point. The restaurant seems a little fancy when you first walk in, but then you realize it&#39;s very casual. Think paper menus but cloth napkins. I loved the bread with dips. I had a vegetarian &#34;ravioli&#34; type dish which was fascinating and delicious. This would make a great first date place.

Blown away. The service was great, all of the men that worked were engaging in initiating conversation, they all gave us their opinion on favorite and popular dishes. We ordered the cauliflower, the chicken like Korma, and the ravioli appetizer. Yum! Been here five years and walk by the place daily, was afraid of branching out...DON&#39;T BE AFRAID, you will be blown away!Great job, I will return

This place is amazing. The food is just so damn good. I can&#39;t even. I&#39;ve never ordered delivery, only eaten in the actual restaurant, but the ambiance is quite nice. There&#39;s Afghan music playing and there&#39;s portraits on the wall. There are a ton of vegetarian options, so that&#39;s good. My favorite indulgent treat meal in SF... part of the reason it tastes so good is because there&#39;s so much oil, just so y&#39;all are warned! The pumpkin kaddo is great, and the special vegetarian entree includes all of their best vegetarian options like fried eggplant.

As a Native of Afghanistan, I would like to ask one question: What happened to all the spices that we normally put in our dishes? because everything was so bland, I might as well have been eating dirt!

It&#39;s Sunday night, the BF and I are tired of packing up our apartment for a move, and we want to take a break and check out Helmand Palace. We arrive at 7:50ish behind a family of four. We are all seated rather quickly.We got some water, menus, and a wine list. And that is IT.The cool thing about Helmand Palace is they have magic water that actually makes some people INVISIBLE. It definitely worked on me and the boyfriend (we&#39;re so special).Try as I might I could not get the waitress&#39; attention (she ran past us at least 40 times cleaning tables). The waiter was no better. He waited on the family of four, they ordered and received wine, they got complimentary breads/dipping sauces (just like everyone else eating around us), they ordered and received their appetizers.8:30 PM: My boyfriend finally broke through his invisibility charm in order to grab the waiter&#39;s attention. The BF could hardly start his sentence before the waiter says &#34;I KNOW you are waiting. I&#39;ll be with you soon.&#34;Cue the two guys who walked in 5 min ago, &#34;WE want to order too!&#34;Will they be waited on before us? THE SUSPENSE8:31 PM : Guys are waited on by, apparently, the KING of Helmand Palace himself, Mr. All-Important WaiterF**K, REALLY?I&#39;m ready to bounce, but the BF wants to see if Your Royal Highness will come over to us next. SPOILER ALERT: He doesn&#39;t. I wait in agony for another 10 min. before I can&#39;t handle it anymore, and we bust out of the dungeon we got trapped in.I estimate we were about 5 min away from a Real Housewives of New Jersey TABLE FLIP.

I was there on Dec-1, 2013 after my drive back from Highway-1 with my Afghan Friend. This place is at a great location with delicious food. We ordered Friend Bowlani, Mantow, Kofta and rice with Doug. Everything was just perfect. I am becoming fan of Afghan food.

Excellent afghan food. Mostly I think of kabobs when I hear afghan, but this place has a lot of cool different dishes, with generous portions that will fill you up. They give you flatbread with 3 sauces; the bread is yummy (but can dry out fast, so eat up!). The pumpkin is delicious as everyone says, but be warned that it is quite sweet for an appetizer. The aushak ravioli appetizer was also delicious, and something I&#39;d probably get again as it is savory vs the pumpkin&#39;s sweet. My mantwo entree was like a set of soft dumplings covered in a yogurt, ground beef, split pea and more stuff, similar to the sauce used on the aushak. Had a bite of a friend&#39;s lamb - this stuff seems really well prepared, so I&#39;d like to give it a full shot another time. Left too stuffed for dessert, but I&#39;d like to come back and try more of their dishes, esp. ones that don&#39;t cover everything in the yogurt beef sauce, which got a little repetitive by the end of my meal.

Great, great place. Been going there for almost 8 years now. They were great when they were on broadway and haven&#39;t skipped a beat since they moved to Van Ness a few years ago. And their staff has been the same over the years. incredible!Love their lamb and mourgh challows and the pumpkin is awesome. Tried out their delivery a couple of weeks ago and much to our (pleasant) surprise, they included their flat bread and the 3 &#39;chutneys&#39; that go with it.Love em :)

I decided what to order based on your pictures and it was really helpful!We ordered the Vegetarian special and people are right... the baby pumkin was AMAZING. It was really sweet and I enjoyed putting it on their warm bread... almost like jam! We also ordered the lamb which was extremely tender (not gamey either).Solid place, and would definitely return.

While everything I&#39;ve tried at the Helmand is good, I go here pretty much for the pumpkin (kaddo) alone. It&#39;s amazing and I&#39;ve never been able to find it anywhere else. (I&#39;ve also tried cooking kaddo at home--it was too much effort and only half as good as the Helmand&#39;s). In fact, when I visit the Helmand, I now order kaddo as a starter and main dish. You can get vegetarian kaddo (just pumpkin) or the meat option (with ground lamb). For once, I actually prefer the vegetarian version of a dish--just pure pumpkin goodness.The atmosphere is nice. I miss the old North Beach location, which was damaged in the landslide. Is it super pretentious to say the decor of the old location was charmingly unpolished? It had a white table-cloth formality combined with an eclectic selection of photos on the walls. The new Russian Hill location is a little more updated but retains the same warmth.I also miss the old location because to me a perfect evening consisted of the Helmand for dinner followed by coffee and dessert at a North Beach cafe. Dessert at the Helmand is so-so. The baklava is very good, but the pudding is kind of a generic cornstarch pudding that you might get at a cafeteria. Next time, I&#39;m ordering the kaddo for dessert, too.

I&#39;ve never had Afghanistan food before but was pleasantly surprised by Helmand Palace. The atmosphere is very nice and the staff is so attentive and awesome and I really enjoyed everything we ordered.The food was delicious.- the free warm flat-ish bread is AMAZING- the kaddo is really good- chowpan was excellent with yummy rice- we got two different eggplant dishes (laghatac and banjan) that were good but not the best at the meal- some dessert that was like pudding with fruit on top that was deliciousAfghanistan food is a lot like Mediterranean food but better in my opinion and with similarities to Indian food.Will definitely need to come back here with more people and try some different dishes.The people who say this is the best Afghanistan food in the city are probably right (and not just because there are like 2 other places total).

Excellent, reasonably priced food. Afghani food appears to be a natural fusion between middle eastern and Indian style. We shared 4 dishes, 2 chicken, 1 lamb and one beef, and they were all fresh, hot and tasty. The appetizer of grilled pumpkin with beef was surprisingly good too, as was the lentil side dish.The place was full, but not packed and the service was quick and friendly.

I love Afghan food. I crave Afghan food. If you&#39;re visting, I&#39;m using your visit as an excuse to eat here. Most Afghan places, I eat the kabobs. This place, getting a meal with one of the amazing sauces is key. There are lots of fabulous vegetarian dishes - the spinach and the pumpkin (kaddo) are delicious. What could be better than a bowlawn? Deep fried pastry stuffed with potato...mmmm, deep fried food...The mantwo and the aushak, both are some of the best ravioli-equivalents you could hope to eat. Love the yogurt sauces.

The latest stop on our International Dinner club adventure was Afghan. We all had no idea what to expect, and left delightfully pleased.We started with the Vegetarian Kaddo,&#34; and it was sweet and savory, it could&#39;ve even passed as dessert. It was almost like a unique take on Pumpkin Pie, only fresher. We also tried the &#34;Vegetarian Aushak,&#34; as an appetizer, and the spices blended together were incredible.My friend L and I split the &#34;Seek Kabab&#34; (I really wanted lamb and was dying to try the Pallow rice) and the &#34;Lawand&#34;. It was very difficult to decide which I liked better. All over yum.I also really liked the warm, cozy ambiance and the cheery, yellow walls. Friendly service and delectably tasty food.

helmand palace was decent: the decor reminds me an older grandparent&#39;s living room. a little more on the dated, opulent side with gold framed oversized pictures, heavy cushioned dining chairs and lush velvety carpets. the food itself was good and the waiting staff did their jobs and waited on us. but nothing really stood out for me here. on the other hand, i have no complaints so they earned a solid 3 stars from me.

The BFF and I are always looking for a new dining experience and adventure. I told her that when I used to ride on the bus along Van Ness, I&#39;d pass this place. I had wanted to try it but the opportunity didn&#39;t come up until I saw the scoutmob deal! We made plans and made the trek over to the place. Parking is atrocious especially at night so plan accordingly. Take the bus but if you must drive...have patience. We almost gave up but we found parking so we were happy when we did.When we get inside there is a nice crowd inside. Not too busy but not too quiet. We are seated right away. This was the first time we would have food from Afghanistan so we were a little intimidated. But after looking at the menu, we knew it was going to be alright. I also asked the waiter if he had any recommendations.For starters, we had the Kadoo. It was pumpkin with sugar and a beef sauce on top. At first glance, you wouldn&#39;t think it goes together but after tasting it, it just magically meshed well together. You aren&#39;t sure what to think but you can&#39;t help but eat some more!The BFF got Mourgh Challow. Chicken with spices, yogurt and cilantro with challow rice. The chicken was moist and the flavors were amazing.I ordered the Theeka Kabab. It was beef with grilled veggies, grapes, lentils and pallow rice. It was a beautiful plate and again, the flavors were wonderful. You just have to try it for yourself. I will say that the beef could&#39;ve been a little more moist but it was still delicious...I ate it up!For dessert, we tried the rice pudding with pistachios. It wasn&#39;t too sweet which was good. Nice and subtle.By the end, we were full. Everything was good. The service was phenomenal! LOVE. Will definitely come back...

The food is amazing, as covered by other reviewers here..The ambiance was much better than I was led to believe. They have a nice color theme going, with mostly cream/white walls and tables, dark chairs, and the dark blue ceiling lamps and glasses.Street parking was hard, so after 10 mins of hunting, we opted for the $10 valet parking.

I came here with friends for dinner with a bloomspot certificate. Visually, the decor is kind of drab but I didn&#39;t come here to stare at the walls. Staff were super friendly and service was excellent. And the food was superb. The Afghan &#34;naan&#34; was so addictive. We had to ask for refills multiple times. It came with a spicy red pepper sauce, yogurt sauce and a cilantro sauce. The cilantro was my favorite, very refreshing. Loved the Kaddo - it was a nice combination of sweet and savory. The Aushak had a nice balance as well. The leeks and scallions were very mild in taste and made a great complement with the yogurt mint sauce.For entrees, we ordered the Mourgh Kabab, Seek Kabab and the Fish of the day which was sea bass. All amazing. We found everything to be perfectly seasoned and not at all overwhelming in spices. I can&#39;t wait to go back!

I think the Kaddo should be a required appetizer. I loved the large starter pumpkin-yogurt-meat dish; it is an amazing combination of sweet and savory. I finished not only mines but gladly offered to help of my friends around me.The Chapendaz, which is a healthy serving of beef tenderloin, is very tender, juicy and tasty. The sides were somewhat forgettable.Given the slow service and price, I&#39;d say an otherwise 3-star restaurant bumped up a notch by the kaddo.

First time having aghani food last night. Place wasn&#39;t too busy on a saturday night so got seated right away for a party of 4. Food was fantastic! What stood out for me surprisingly was the bread that they served. Normally at restaurants I never care for the bread but the bread here was amazing, I just kept chomping on it while chatting it up with my friends. Although the entrees are not meant to be shared, we did it family style which I recommend if its your first time trying.What we ordered:Appetizers:Ashuk- this is like a ravioli dish, very good. It became a really good dipping sauce for the breadBowlani- I personally loved it, esp the one with chives the fried skin reminded me of chinese green onion pancake and the filling reminded me of the filling in chinese panfried chive dumpling.Shornakod- Alright, i felt that the chickpeas were a little overcooked and the dressing needed to be more tangyEntrees:Dwopiaza- this was probably one of my favs.. the lamb was very good, but the complements and sides on the dish was just okayMourgh Challow- very good, can&#39;t go wrong with this dish if you eat chickenChapandez- I didn&#39;t really like this one... it reminded me of a sour hamburger pattyVegetarian special- I did not like this dish either...it was too sweet for my taste.Overall, I had a wonderful time, service can be better but I can&#39;t really complain because my friends paid for me =)

We have eaten here a handful of times over the years. The Afghan spices are unique and wonderfully tasty. Every time, the service is quite lacking, but if you want interesting food that is different and allows you to explore new spices with good food (pumpkin, lamb, beef) go eat here.The wine is Carlo Rossi out of a jug...uhhhhhh, that&#39;s what we bought in college when we couldn&#39;t afford anything else.

I was very impressed with my first time.The portions were large, and felt very authentic. Not too much processing, the veggies were fresh and everything tasted great. The bread was good, and their spinach was fantastic. The lamb was excellent, lean, and didn&#39;t have any chewy bits. Both me and my fiance were very satisfied with everything. The prices were reasonable too, with both dishes, tax, delivery and tip coming to under thirty dollars. We&#39;ll definitely come back.

This is how I would bring peace to Afghanistan:- Fly the various factions to San Francisco- Bring them to Helmand- Start with the pumpkin kaddo (sweetly delicious) and ravioli aushak (even if you avoid beef, get the beef sauce, very worth the sample.- Fill the main courses with mourgh kebabs (generous and flavorful chicken) and a lamb dish or two, all served complimented by rice, potatoes and spinach.- Cross your fingers excellent food from home and the beauty of San Francisco brings people togetherThis place also works for less world peace critical nights like dinner between friends. Excellent no matter what the occasion.

The waiters weren&#39;t overly helpful for answering questions about the menu but at the same time very friendly and attentive.

Similar to a sweet potato side dish - mixture of sweet and savory.Yogurt salad: A little boring by itself but tasty when combined with house bread and some of the sauces.Entrees:Kofta Kabab: Loved the seasoning!Mourgh Challow: Yummy, very much like an Indian curry chicken (but not spicy)Mourgh Kabab: The chicken was very tender and tasty.Theeka Kabab: My least favorite of the four, not enough flavor.Dessert:Baklawa: Best I&#39;ve had, not overly sweet and runny but still moistCream with fruit: Not a fan.Will definitely be back, especially excited for take-out since it&#39;s close to my house!

One of my favorite restaurants in the city in a place I least expected to find great food (Van Ness).When you go, try the kaddo (baked baby pumpkin) appetizer and the lawand (lamb) and theeka kebab (beef) entrees.The dishes are thicker than curries and have an emphasis on high-quality, tender meat. The flavors are as complex as Indian dishes but less spicy and more sweet.You&#39;ll also get bread with three sauces free with your meal.It&#39;s a tranquil setting with music and colorful artwork on the walls.If your tastes are anything like mine you&#39;ll love it.

I had been wanting to try this place because it&#39;s right down the street from us and I&#39;d heard it was amazing. So maybe I hyped it up too much, but it really was just ok. I think it&#39;s probably much better if you eat meat (my sig-o and I are both veggies), as it seems like the meat dishes are the ones everyone raves about.

We had a wonderful night at Helmand.They allowed us to do a full buffet cast party for the opera that I&#39;m involved in. Over 40 people shoved into this quaint little homey place.The food was SPECTACULAR! The Pumpkin Kaddo and Baklava were the best I&#39;ve ever had.One star is removed because one piece of chicken was just barely questionable as to whether it had been cooked long enough. I avoided that piece and alerted staff and they seemed shocked. I&#39;m sure it&#39;s not normal for them as they cook everything fresh and are probably not used to accommodating such a large group all at once.I will give them the benefit of the doubt.

Food is excellent here!It is a quiet, no frills place. The decor, interiors look nice and clean. The food is exceptionally good. They serve you nice warm bread with different sauces to start with. My fiance LOVES this bread, its soft and at a perfect temperature. I always get the cauliflower dish and he gets the chicken in curry dish. Always the same taste and same quality. The best thing here to eat though is their rice (challow), its the best tasting basmati rice I have eaten.

So far I have had food to go twice but I loved it both times as I ordered same dishes to determine consistently and I am trying to avoid animal products whenever possible as my diet shifts back to vegetarian.Vegetarian Kourma Challow is quite good but some of turnips and cauliflower come a bit overdone, just barely though. (remember it was to go)Their accompanying breads and three dips are excellent - each so different anyone should be to find a favorite.Yogurt Salad is good but I find the I cilantro to strong and since it is per-mixed my request for them to cut out half was declined.Definitely will go in to get a feel for the place and that could elevate it to 5 stars.

I came back here last weekend and brought the sister with me. It was even better than the first time!For appetizer I had Bowlawni (two pastry shells, one filled with scallions and leeks, the other with spiced potatoes, and served with yogurt). I devoured them!I had the Vegetarian Special which is a platter with baked pumpkin, pan friend eggplant with yogurt sauce, sauteed spinach, and okra sauteed in fresh tomatoes, and this is served with &#34;pallow.&#34; Pallow if you don&#39;t know is boiled rice that is drained of water, seasoned with vegetable oil, cadomum (?), cinnamon, nutmeg, cumin seeds and black pepper, and then baked.The sister had the vegetarian Aushak (Afghan ravioli filled with scallions and leeks, served over yogurt and garlic mint sauce, and topped with yellow split peas and carrot sauce). Interesting indeed. She let me have a bite :)Well the sister didn&#39;t get much of the bread because she was talking and I couldn&#39;t stop eating, hahaha.We had wine and shared a dessert. A very pleasant evening -- we only wish her husband could have joined us as this is a special place.I&#39;ll be back!

What a down-to-earth little gem. Food is unique and exciting; atmosphere is unassuming and intimate; menu is extensive, both for vegetarians and lamb-fiends (like myelf); and prices are rock bottom (esp for SF).everything we ordered was fantastic, except for my lamb dish, which was &#34;pretty good.&#34; we started with the aushak which was an excellent blend of yogurt, lentils and spices. we tried the kaddo which everyone recommended, but it was a little too sweet as an appetizer-- great still, just maybe inappropriate for beginning of meal. my girlfriend got the salmon kabab, which was fantastic. I dont like salmon that much, but i definitely like this restaurant&#39;s preparation. I got the lawand-- which was a bit like an indian lamb curry. it had a bit of strong pungent/ gamey aroma when you bite into it (usually due to lamb fat). many restaurants have trouble getting that flavor out of the lamb, so its not unexpected but this restaurant had a bit too much of it going on. i imagine it would have been better if i got the kabab instead.all-in-all excellent place, definitely going back.

I am a big fan of Helmand Palace. If anyone has ever wanted to try Afghan food and is hesitant to, trust me you will not be disappointed. Every dish there is prefect, there is a dish for everyone. You can be a carnivore, a vegetarian or even a vegan there is something for you. My favorite is the kaddo which is pumpkin with yogurt and beef on top, sounds interesting but trust me it is the best!

Appetizer- Pumpkin Kaddo- The pumpkin was really tasty, but too sweet for my parents. Brother and I enjoyed the rest of it tho haha. Family said the meat was also very good, I don&#39;t eat meat but I&#39;m sure it was good (looked good haha)Entree- My brother and I had the Salmon Kabab; it was sooo YUMMYY! First of all the salmon was very soft and tender. It came with rice and spinach, which both was very good and tasty. Every bite was just so yummy, and eat all three together was just so bomb. As for my parents they shared a lamb dish (forgot what it was called) but they said the lamb was very tasty and not dry at all. We all cleaned our plates clean ;p.. def would come here again to eat, worth the price for the quality of food you get.Service- We came maybe 40 mean before they were closing so the place only had one other table eating. We got our water/ complimentary bread and sauces pretty quick. But when it came to ordering it was somewhat slow since they were getting ready to close. I didn&#39;t mind waiting tho because I know exactly how they feel being a server myself (gotta get shit done and gtfo there man, ITS LATE!!! :O) Other than that they cleared our plates when they needed to be and gave us our check in a timely manner.Atmosphere- Love how the place looks, def has like a modern/traditional mix feeling of Afghanistan :)Overall- Loveeee. Another gem in SF

Reason #2304098 why I love San Francisco: The closest take-out joint to my apartment is an Afghan restaurant.Over the last year and a half, I&#39;ve had several selections from Helmand Palace&#39;s menu--Dwopiaza, Mourgh Challow, and Sabzi Challow, to name a few--and I haven&#39;t yet been disappointed. The portions are always plentiful, the flavors are always interesting, and the bread and three dipping sauces (the tzatziki one is like crack) are basically icing on the cake.The waiter got my wine order and my friend&#39;s meal order wrong when we ate in the restaurant last night, but who cares? We ate and drank everything anyway, and he gave us a free rice pudding dessert for our &#34;troubles.&#34; We weren&#39;t that troubled.

I wouldn&#39;t have eaten here unless I had bought that easy to get coupon fromrestaurant.com. Having only had fabulous afghani food before, I was a bit dissapointed in the food here. It honestly felt a little bland and overpriced.It&#39;s worth a try if youv&#39;e never experianced this cuisine before. Felt like the youngest person there by 20 years. A little to formal for my tastes. The jars of spices behind glass were a bit dusty and didn&#39;t make for great atmosphere.

Oh YUM!!Walk in and inhale deeply to whet your appetite. Our large party got the raised dining area in the back and were well attended too by all the staff. We all ordered something different but the fish of the day, sea bass, and the lamb kebab were really good. I wish there was more meat. The rice and bean mixture that comes with the dish was fantastic... a meal in its self.Great place.I would definitely go back.

4 of us ate here last night and the food was delicious, the ambience was nice, and the service was very slow.For appetizers we shared the aushak and the kaddo. Both were excellent and we had to be careful not to get filled up on the bread while dipping into these appetizers.Our main entrees (all shared) were the qabelee, seek kabob, mourgh challow, and vege kourma challow. All were delicious except for the vege kourma challow (which was OK but nothing special).All in all I would recommend this resto. Valet parking is $5 and given the neighborhood (tough parking) I would highly recommend taking advantage of it.Enjoy.

Indian food is usually a bit too spicy for my Minnesotan taste buds, so Afghani food is pretty good at filling the gap. Many of the dishes are similar but with way less heat.My friends ordered a bunch of food for us to eat family style. The spiced pumpkin appetizer blew my mind. I haven&#39;t had a squash that good since pumpkin pie. The minty yogurt dipping sauce for the breads was also very delicious.I ended up primarily eating the lamb in garlicky spinach. The portions were so large that I had enough for another meal the next day. We ordered to pick up and the food was ready withing half an hour. I will definitely be eating this on another trip to the area.

Points for an entire section of the menu dedicated to vegetarian items. Points for it being close to my house. And, points for the yummy bread and dips at the beginning of the meal. We ordered the bowlawni (fried wonton looking things filled with potato and leaks) to start with - eh, pretty good. A bit doughy, but good. We then got the vegetarian aush (soup) - another &#34;eh&#34; and whoa a lot of lemon. Then came our main dish (vegetarian aushuk - raviolis filled with leaks). Whoa more lemon, almost overpowering. Good thing we opted for the nearly $6.00 side of rice to try and take the bite out of the darn lemon sauce over everything.Glad we tried it, probably won&#39;t be back soon...

This place is great. Service is amazing and food is fantastic, although I am a bit biased since I like afghan food a lot. Having said that though, I think Salang pass in Fremont is a much better alternative. Food is better and the price is cheaper at Salang. But Helmand&#39;s kabuli pulau is a close second :)

I went back to this joint after almost a year, and I think my memory of it was better than it actually was. Don&#39;t get me wrong, it was still really good. But not like AMAZING the way we remembered it. I would still hit up this place once every few months when I&#39;m craving Afghan food ... Favorite dishes remain the same: spinach, eggplant, aushak, kadoo, and baklava.Oh, and they need to give bigger dinner plates ... our plates were barely appetizer sized and made it difficult to eat the food. To quote my cousin &#39;we may as well dump our food all into one big pile because that&#39;s how we&#39;re eating it.&#39;

Food is great but seems to have gone down a tad bit recently in taste and flavors. We are wondering if cooks or management has changed??The Banjan and Bowlani appetizers are yummy. Main courses are large in size but the salmon dish was tasteless and tomato paste on it was a bit too sour.Finding parking takes a while at times so be prepared to hunt or you can do valet parking. The restrooms are pretty dirty.

Helmand bundled me up with that warm home cooked feeling...like thanksgiving all over again. Afghan thanksgiving :)The Sabzi Challow was perfectly cooked.Lamb - tenderliciously satisfying.Rice and spinach - warm and complimenting.Prices were more than reasonable - 12.95 for healthy portions and the staff smiled with my ooohs and ahhs.Come here with a full appetite because you will clean your plate.

I really much enjoyed this place. The pumpkin (reminded me of a holiday meal w candied yams), the fish, the eggplant (which I had a slight allergic reaction to), and the bread (crispy, though I didn&#39;t like the dipping sauces so much). Everything was quite tasty. The environment was comfortable and the service attentive, yet unrushed.

My friend and I came here for a casual date, and it is a place that he frequents, and it was my first time. I couldn&#39;t stuff my face enough! We got a few different dishes with lamb and chicken (Mourg something or other) and they each had unique and rich flavorings, and both were really tasty. But the BEST thing was the Kaddo. It&#39;s an appetizer and the sweet and savory combination of meat, pumpkin, and yogurt is insane. I would have ordered 3 for myself had I known how good it was going to be. Fairly priced. If you&#39;re into ethnic food or feel like venturing out and trying something new, I highly suggest this place- I don&#39;t think you can go wrong with anything on the menu!

This place was pretty baller. Ordered the pumpkin kadoo (since all the other Yelpers seemed to like it) . . . and it was DELICIOUS.The overall check was ~$40 for two people (1 appetizer, 2 entrees) which was a little pricey, but the food was really good.Next time, I think I&#39;ll probably just end up ordering one of each of the appetizers since I really wanted to try one bite of each without having to order the full entree. Will definitely be back.(Also, for all you United Mileage Plus members, go register for MP Dining . . . and in addition to a TASTY tasty meal, you can also earn United miles!)

Fabulous food, feel-good ambiance, nice staff and (surprisingly) no wait. The food is just mouth watering and very consistent. We just stumbled upon this place one day and have gone back atleast half a dozen times in the past 2 years.Last time I ordered Sabzi Challow. Very well cooked and delicious lamb in spinach. Not spicy at all, but full of flavor. Other favorites are the Murgh Challow and Salmon Kebab. Although I am sure all the dishes are equally well prepared.Only thing is that even on weekdays, parking is hard to find. Be prepared to walk a few blocks. It you are fine with that, rest assured, you will be visiting this place a lot :)

Helmand Palace is a great little spot for cheap, flavorful food. The have quite a few vegetarian options for the non-meat eaters and the portions are a healthy size.My friends and I ordered quite a bit and ate everything family style. The stand out item was the Kaddo which is baby pumpkin with a yogurt garlic sauce and ground beef. It sounds a little scary, but it&#39;s really delicious. I tried both the vegetarian version and the one with beef and I have to say, the beef really makes the dish!I will definitely go back with friends again as it&#39;s a great place for sharing. The price is also quite nice. We ordered a ton of food and payed corkage for 4 bottles of wine. For 8 people it was $26 each, including tax &amp; tip.

Worst Afghan food I&#39;ve ever had. For those that have never had real Afghan food, I can understand why you may think it&#39;s good. &#34;Oh! Here&#39;s something remotely exotic! Afghan food! I shall eat here and can claim myself to be cultured!&#34; Alas, this is not real Afghan food. I don&#39;t know wth this is, but I do know that it&#39;s disgusting. Went with a group of about 10 or so awhile back. And almost everyone in our group agreed that this was the worst Afghan food ever. Of course the TWO people that liked the food here had never had real, tasty, comforting Afghan food. The food here did not taste like authentic Afghan food. For authentic Afghan food, I&#39;d suggest getting Afghani friends that know how to cook--if that fails, I&#39;d recommend Salang Pass in Fremont. Even Afghan Village has better food than this place.What I don&#39;t understand is in some of your guys&#39; reviews, you mention a &#34;vegetarian&#34; aushak...isn&#39;t this kind of repetitive? Aushak is supposed to be vegetarian. Mantoo is the one that has meat in it.

Haven&#39;t ordered a bad dish yet from here. Have had both take-out and dine-in. Food ingredients and presentation are great. Service very nice and attentive but unobtrusive. Decor is ok, but who cares about that. This is about food. Absolutely impossible to get parking around here because of the Polk St. overflow. And that&#39;s the only negative thing I can think of about the place. They have two soups only on the menu. The spicier of the two (it&#39;s red and I don&#39;t remember what it&#39;s called) is incredible. The white soup was so-so - not my cup of tea, but that doesn&#39;t mean it wasn&#39;t good for what it was. Menu is quite focused. The food here is put together with absolute confidence. I don&#39;t know the chef, but I bet he/she has 20+ years of experience. Eat here.

I got a $50 gift certificate for Helmand Palace and decided to go with two friends - one had been before and the other had only had Helmand Palace delivered via Waiters on Wheels. NOTE: Dining in here is a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE. I had been to Helmand Palace when it was on Broadway. The new location is a bit nicer. The food is as magnificent as I remember, perhaps even better. We had our own wine (corkage $10) and I also recommend getting something with pumpkin in it.And yes, the co-owner is President Hamid Karzai&#39;s (of Afghanistan) brother Mahmood.

I literally signed up on Yelp just to write this review--I just ordered take-out from here and it is the best meal Ive had all week San Francisco; definitely up to my NYC foodie standards!!I ordered the Kaddo for starters which was AMAZING. I could have eaten it for dessert!! Im so glad I got the version with the meat sauce-it topped it off so nicely-If they had a giant entree version I would get that next time and be wonderfully happy.As an entree, after much debate, I ordered the Seek Kabab and I was SO glad I did. The meat was seasoned perfectly and incredibly tender.I combined it with the eggplant and pallow rice and tested it with each of their 3 sauces they give you (with bread and no extra charge btw!) It was so delicious!!!I heard great things about their baklawa (Afghan version of baklava, dusted with pistachio) so I had to try that for dessert (they didn&#39;t have it on the take out menu online but I put a request in for it under the comments before ordering). They gave me a giant piece and it was literally the best ive ever had-it was so moist and yet flaky they had to have made it a few hours ago!To top it all off after I paid, I left with my order and was down a block and across the street and the waiter ran after me in the middle of traffic (literally) just to give me my silverware &amp; napkin in a little baggie! SO nice!!! Now that is terrific service!!I ***HIGHLY*** recommend this restaurant to anyone &amp; everyone! It was so beautiful inside as well. I am definitely going to go back and sit down and enjoy the ambiance and some more delicious food!! =D

I love Afghan food and this place was no disappointment. We got the kaddo as everyone recommended on yelp, and it did not disappoint. The sweetness of the pumpkin combined with the savory yogurt and meat sauce was amazing. For my main course I had the Afghan version of lamb chops. The lamb was cooked well and the rice and eggplant side were great! There was so much food I couldn&#39;t finish it. Great service and great place for a meat-eating/vegetarian couple to eat as there are many options of both. I&#39;ll be back!

went here with a friend, after craving afghan for about 6 mos :)Place is a bit outdated in my opinion, and I was a bit surprised to find it not too busy on Friday night around 7pm. But hey, I guess that&#39;s a plus for us since we were STARVING!Appetizers:Mantwo - little dumplings filled with onion/beef topped with carrots, yogurts, yellow split-pea and beef. didn&#39;t try it , but i&#39;ve had it elsewhere and it was amazing! This version seemed pretty sauce-heavy, but im never turned off by that. My friend who had it ate every bit and said it was pretty amazing, so i&#39;ll take his word for itKaddo - fav thing ever! baby pumpkin with garlic yogurt and beef. perfect mixture that I never would&#39;ve thought to be good. a MUST TRY!Entree:Theeka Kabab - SOO GOOD, prime rib of beef, with a side of pallow rice and sauteed lentils. The prime rib beef, there were only 4-5 pieces of it, but boy was it HEAVENLY. perfectly moist and had all its juices still (couldn&#39;t eat it all and had it for leftovers...STILL just as enjoyable!). There was a grilled pear and other veggies along with the other side dishes. The sauteed lentils had this delicious spice in it that made it very hearty and tasty. The rice was a bit dry, but seeing that was just an accompaniment/starch, I didn&#39;t think too much of it.lawand - leg of lamb served with pallow rice and spinach. my friend who is in love with lamb got this dish and ate every bite of it. I was surprised that the lamb came out looking more like curry, but it looked delicious and very flavorful. He said that it had a bit of kick to it from the hot peppers but was not too spicy. The spinach looked creamy and somewhat like my pureed lentils, but instead spinach - looked delicious! Seeing that he ate ALL OF IT, I&#39;m assuming it was.I always find that Afghan food is a pleasant surprise for those who have never tried it, it was my friend&#39;s first time having it. When I asked him what he thought afterward, he also was a bit surprised to see how amazing/delightful it was.On my take, even though I&#39;ve only had it twice now, its a nice mixture between Indian food and Mediterranean (maybe it makes sense, geographically?).The service here was very good, I had a gift cert but forgot to print it out beforehand, but the manager was more than fine with me bringing it up on my cell phone. Although it was unnecessary in my opinion, the servers and decorations made it seem like the restaurant wanted to provide a &#39;fine dining&#39; experience. Although it was halfway there, I thought it was cute in the restaurant&#39;s attempt. However, when I think of Afghan food, I automatically resort to a hearty meal found in a mom/pop&#39;s authentic/homey type of location. Then again maybe that&#39;s just me. Regardless, Helmand Palace was delicious, a bit over the top for pricing, but then again how often can you really find delicious Afghan dining? Highly recommend that everyone try it!

Mourgh Challow is. so. damn. good. If you like chicken tikka masala, you will probably enjoy this dish as well...but it has a flavor unmatched by any other cuisine I&#39;ve ever tasted. And it comes with very flavorful rice called challow.Kaddo, an appetizer, was unique in flavor (sweet butternut squash with beef on top).The bread they serve with an assortment of chutneys is good too.Decent service though food takes a while to arrive (at least it did for a group of 4 on a saturday night).

A fun place to try to some different flavors. It&#39;s not fancy or romantic, but a nice place for a date nonetheless, especially for a carnivore. I know nothing about Afghani food, so I have no real idea if it&#39;s authentic, but everything was good, and I&#39;m told the owner is actually the brother of President Karzai, so I am going to assume that it&#39;s authentic cuisine. Not so good that we should invade their country to get more of it, but worth a meal at this restaurant.

I guess I don&#39;t really like Afghan food or I ate at a different restaurant from the other Yelpers. My dinner companions and I seem to be the only ones who did not care for this restaurant. Our friend, Donkey/Josh K., really wanted to try this place before he returned to his motherland (the greater Boston area).First of all, the service sucked. The server took forever to take our order. She came to our table and asked if we were ready to order about 15 minutes after we were seated. We said yes and then she walked away. 10 to 15 minutes later she finally returned. Not a good start.We ordered a couple of appetizers, including the afghan-style ravioli. None of us liked the Afghan style raviolis. We did not care for the flavor combinations or the slimy texture of the ravioli skin. The side order of daal we ordered was flavorful and good. Donkey and Eddie H. ordered the soup, which they said was okay.I ordered the lamb kebab. It was decent but a little salty. I did not really like the cold pumpkin with yogurt on the side. I could understand the purpose of having the sweet flavor and cool temperature as a balancing factor for the spices in the warm lamb, but I did not like the flavors very much. The challow rice was okay.The best dish that any of us ordered was definitely the koufta - spicy beef meatballs. The sauce was delicious. If I ever ate here again, which is frankly highly unlikely, that is what I would order. The warm flatbread with accompanying sauces was also really good. The baklava dessert we had was also good.Again, the service was not good. It took a long time for our bill to arrive and we had to ask to have our waters filled.I am a lover of many different types of food. I suppose Afghan food is just not for me.

First time trying Afghan food and boy was I impressed! My wife and I shared the Yogurt Salad and Kaddo for appetizers, and had the Mourgh (chicken) and Seek (lamb) kebabs for dinner. I&#39;m pretty sure this was the most flavorful, tender lamb that I have ever treated my mouth to. Great service, and without the pretentious Marina vibe. Will return for sure.

Helmand Palace feels oddly out of the way considering it is on Van Ness. I&#39;ve eaten here twice and liked it both times, although most recently I ate there when it was fairly crowded and the service was slow.The food in general is great. For appetizers I think that the Banjan (eggplant slice) is kind of overpriced for what it is and I didn&#39;t particularly like the Kaddo (pumpkin with beef), but I really enjoyed their Dall (lentils).The Aushak (ravioli/wonton sort of thing) got mixed reviews at our table, but I liked it. Mourgh (chicken) Challow and Sabzi (lamb) Challow were both really good. Every lamb dish I&#39;ve tried has been awesome, very tender and flavorful.The prices are reasonable (although I don&#39;t think you should ever have to pay more than $4 for an Anchor in SF--they charge $4.50) and the waiters are very nice as well.

Don&#39;t come here if you&#39;re looking for something uber-hip and trendy -- come here for unique, extremely tasty food, and an endearingly kitsch atmosphere.One thing you must absolutely order is the kaddo -- baked pumpkin with yogurt sauce and ground beef sauce (!!!!) on top (sweet, savory, AMAZING). I also recommend Lawand (yummy lamb in a sweet sauce meant to be mopped up with their naan-like bread) and the Teeka Kebab (lovely marinated and grilled steak). For dessert we had the creamy pudding with fresh fruit. A definite must-do. Our cab was perfectly tasty as well.And if you&#39;re starving, your&#39;e in luck. They serve their bread with three different dipping sauces (one spicy, one yogurt, one cilantro-y) --- each dip was a huge decision -- could never decide which one i wanted!Anyway, this place was a fabulous a new (for me) dining experience!

The Helmand is a classic and doesn&#39;t need any trendy gimmicks to lure in a loyal following. It&#39;s Afghani cuisine, which to me translates into a lot of lamb. You really can&#39;t go wrong with any of the dishes, and the vegetarian options hold their own. They have three accompanying sauces to add flavor and texture as desired, and the naan bread that accompanies each meal is perfect for dipping.Oddly located by all the &#34;gentlemen&#39;s clubs&#34; on Broadway in North Beach, it&#39;s really an oasis of good food on an otherwise dirty strip of pavement.

This place is a wonderful neighborhood gem! Excellent food and consistent quality paired with a warm and friendly staff. I&#39;m addicted to the Banjan, Shornakhad Salad, Mourgh Challow and their Rice Pudding with Cardamon and Pistachio. Please don&#39;t change a thing!

This place is wonderful! It was my first time trying Afghan food and it was delicious. I was with a party of wonderful people and the service was great. I had a lamb and rice plate and we all shared 3 bottles of red wine. I would definitely come back to this place! Glad I had a satisfying first time experience.

I don&#39;t normally crave Afghan food, but I would happily go back to Helmand. I highly recommend the lawand entree: tender pieces of lamb in a rich, flavorful sauce with pureed spinach and basmati rice on the side. Delicious. The couple of appetizers that I sampled were tasty, and they bring 3 sauces to the table so you can dress up any dish.

I like to stop by restaurants that have been reviewed favorably on Yelp to test one of the most mentioned dishes, get it for take out, and taste the food before committing to a whole $20-$30 investment in a place. This time, it was the Kaddo.The host was very happy to take my small take-out order, even though it was only $6. My thoughts on the Kaddo:* Very rich; complex flavors.* A little sweet, but it was complemented nicely by the salty ground beef sauce* A tad greasy, but I usually expect that from restaurantsOverall, I was very pleased with the food I had there-- definitely plan on returning for a full meal.

The weird odour in the foyer thankfully wasn&#39;t a problem once we were inside. I prefered the aushak to the mantoo, but I&#39;m beginning to suspect this is a general preference and not restaurant-specific. Qabalee was good, if getting close to overdone, but I think I&#39;d rather have my lamb in kebab form without the distraction of raisins and carrots. A nibble of a friend&#39;s kofte kebab revealed a nice sear without the smokiness you get some places. I think I liked Salang Pass in Fremont a bit more (and if you just want kebabs, go to one of the De Afghanans), but haven&#39;t been there in a while and should revisit.

Went here last night and really enjoyed this place. I had never tried Afghan food, but I knew it wouldn&#39;t be too exotic for the Western palate. So if you&#39;re thinking that this place is going to have odd flavors you never expected, you might be in for a pleasant surprise.The atmosphere is nice and calm and wasn&#39;t too loud or quiet, so I could talk easily without feeling like I was being overheard. People were decently dressed, which made me feel out of place when I walked in with a hooded sweatshirt. But I didn&#39;t get any dirty looks :).When it came to the food, this turned out to be a real treat. I had the Salmon Kabab which was fairly simple but well made. The flavor was a little more robust than I normally like to eat fish, but this was actually good. My date had the Kafta Kabob (ground beef) which was also delicious. Perfect blend of spices and juicy enough to savor at the same time.No complaints about the service either. Overall this was a very enjoyable meal!

B said he could eat here everyday. That statement in itself, should garner Helmand Palace 5 stars. I, on the other hand, could come here once a week rather than everyday. I&#39;d also be happier if they really did deliver, as they state on the menu they left on our door. We called one night for delivery and they said their driver was out so delivery service was unavailable. Hmm. The atmosphere was ok. Very musty smelling as soon as you walk inside. A solid 4 stars from me.On a recent visit, we had the aushak to start, the kaddo as a side dish, and chowpan and kourma challow as entrees. Everything we ate was absolutely delicious. The kourma challow is solid comfort food - B said it reminded him of his mom&#39;s lamb stew. I loved the kaddo and thought it made our entrees taste even more delicious. For dessert, we went with the rice pudding. B enjoyed it a lot more than I did.Even though we&#39;re moving away from the neighborhood, we&#39;ll certainly be back. They offer valet parking on Fri/Sat and I think there&#39;s free parking in a lot nearby on weeknights.

I wanted to like this place after seeing it reviewed on an episode of PBS show Check, Please!Unfortunately, there is a musty, mildew-y smell if you sit by the entrance/bar, and if you are dining with others that are super-sensitive to this it can wreck your dining experience.For appetizer I had the kaddo, pan-fried/baked pumpkin....seasoned with sugar &amp; topped w/ground beef sauce. An unusual combination of sweet &amp; savory...and almost too sweet/dessert-like. Fortunately I shared it so it wasn&#39;t too much.For entree I had the dwopiaza, marinated/grilled lamb with yellow split-peas. The lamb itself was good but I didn&#39;t care for the split-pea sauce (my mistake, since I&#39;m not a fan but ordered it anyway).My dining partners had mixed reviews for their selections but overall were not very impressed.The restaurant was pretty full &amp; many people came in to pick up take-out orders, so this place must be doing something right.Parking is challenging in that area &amp; we ended up parking blocks away on Broadway/Fillmore...good for an after-dinner walk though.I probably won&#39;t be back...overall food was okay but I&#39;ve had better/worse.

I&#39;ve been coming here since I was a child and it&#39;s still a family favorite. They have a great vegetarian selection and everything I&#39;ve had is amazing.My absolute mouth-watering favorite is the baby pumpkin, I don&#39;t know what they do to make it but it is delish!They&#39;ve moved locations but not quality. The service is great and it&#39;s rarely busy.To end your meal I recommend the Turkish coffee which is stronger then anything I&#39;ve ever had. It&#39;s thick as oil and topped with pistacho nuts, it will surely leave you bouncing off the walls.This is one of my favorite spots in the city and its one of the best Afghan restaurants i&#39;ve ever been to.

I wanted to try this place not only because it was different, but because there were numerous vegetarian choices on the menu, and I was not disappointed. I had the pumpkin and eggplant--I&#39;m not really a fan of either one normally, but was in an adventurous mood. The flavors were surprisingly good together.I also had the chickpea and potato salad, which was very delicious. My husband had the beef kebab (I know that&#39;s not the actual name of the dish, so I apologize) and he was also very impressed.They had a very nice selection of wines, with bottles at very reasonable prices.The atmosphere was nice; there was a good crowd in there but it didn&#39;t feel packed and it was easy to have a conversation. The service was pleasant and attentive, but not incredibly enthusiastic about making suggestions for either the food or accompanying wine. That&#39;s not a huge deal, but I guess to me that would be the difference between 4 and 5 stars.I highly recommend Helmand Palace and definitely intend to go back!

The food is so damn good here it made a friend of mine literally pass out! (although that may have had something to do with dehydration).As interesting as it was seeing my buddies sneaker-soles up on the floor, I have to say that my concern for my fallen comrade was quickly erased by the amazing flavor storm that was sitting on my plate in front of me.I&#39;m not quite sure how my buddy ended up, as I was too busy scorfing the custard based desert. Wow. Their coffee is amazing too.For sure things to try:1. The eggplant2. Anything that says pumpkin on it3. Chicken ke-bab4. Custard desert.This is the restaurant that introduced me to Afghani food, so, I&#39;m scared to go anywhere else. These fellas cook a mean meal.P.S. You can bring your own wine too, for a $15 corkage fee - giddy up.

4 stars for the food, 4 stars for the decor and the place, 4 stars for the service.Overall, this is a very very pleasant restaurant. It was really cool to see influences of different cuisine in the Afghan cuisine. Noodles in soup, ravioli, and of course the Mediterranean standards.Items ordered: the ravioli with ground beef and mint yogurt sauce, noodles in soup, sweet pumpkin side, okra side, koufa kabob (? I think it&#39;s their version of lula kabob) and the fish of the day sea bass. All very good.Dessert and Turkish coffee were kind of a miss. We got the cream pudding (made out of milk and cornstarch!) with fresh(?) berries on top and we were not huge fans of it. Our server saw that we didn&#39;t love it and he gladly took it off the check. He was very gracious about it.Most definitely recommended to eat there, but for dessert you might go somewhere else or get freaky at home.

Man I loved this place when it was on Broadway. That was before the landslide that forced the place to be red-tagged since there was a new boulder outside their back window (I can only assume). They had a $9.99 lunch buffet, and it was the best Afghan bargain in the Bay Area. The tastiest, too.I haven&#39;t been to the new location, but I can imagine that they serve the same amazing food. My fave is of course the kadoo (isn&#39;t that a Cranium sequel?) which is sweetened baked pumpkin. The kabobs, Indian-like sauced dishes, and hot house bread were excellent, too.Here&#39;s why you have to get the lunch buffet (assuming they still have it). If you go for dinner you can expect to pay $15 per entree. You&#39;ll have to get the $5 kaddo, and maybe an appetizer, which means your meal will be $20 per person instead of $10. And of course their Afghan food is the best in the Bay Area.The owner&#39;s brother is Hamid Karzai, the leader of Afghanistan!!! Also, but probably not as geopolitically important, they used to have this rice pudding dessert on their menu with the best name ever - something like &#34;sheepberating.&#34;

Delicious! Started off with the bread and dipping sauces. The bread was fresh and hot and the yogurt and other sauces were a nice compliment. We then proceeded to devour every appetizer on the menu. Even the eggplant was good and I usually hate eggplant. The entrees were great; the lamb special was cooked in a good sauce and the sea bass was decent (although seemed out of place on the menu). My favorite was the lamb shank though, nicely grilled and flavorful. The over abundance of waiters (I think we had 4) was a little odd, but funny at times...

Really cool, tasty place to eat that&#39;s guaranteed to have something you haven&#39;t tried before. The chef worships Cardamom, and Cardamom has blessed him or her in turn because all of the dishes have a fragrant, delicate quality to them. Every entree is a sensory delight; the experience here is wonderful, and I recommend you take your time enjoying the exotic bounty. End your meal with coffee, kissed with Cardamom, to finish the evening. Walk out the door, and you may be surprised to see Van Ness--not a spice bazaar.

Not sure why I held off on this review, maybe it was because I had repressed it, and after a few months of therapy I&#39;m ready to talk about it. We went to this place with some friends and we ordered a number of dishes ranging from a curry to rice dishes. All the food was great and I took the left overs home. The decor is nothing to get excited about, but in the end it&#39;s the food...So why did I repress this memory...oh that&#39;s right. There was a table next to us with a dozen bartenders celebrating a birthday. Now...bartenders work in the industry of drunks. These were not bartenders from Cocktail or some swank place. These were your round the corner, tattoo&#39;d, does a shot with you, bartenders. And a couple of them were hammered. I mean seriously gone. They were yelling and screaming and some poor middle-eastern family had come in to eat and had to sit next to them. Then the &#34;bad&#34; stuff happened. One of the larger women at the table decided it was too &#34;hot&#34; in there. And took off her shirt. and did it again. Free boobs with your rice sir? No thanks! No Thanks...

We recently used them for a staff holiday lunch (he graciously opened for us - I was unaware my boss was a well-acquainted customer already). I had attempted to suggest some plates to be served family style so everyone could try different stuff and Daud (the manager/owner?) insisted I should leave that to him -- and he was right! I had been for dinner but had no idea how great some of the dishes were, or any idea of the variety. I see why folks are so distressed that the buffet is not happening, as that is basically what he did for us and it was perfect. A bit out of the way and parking is a nightmare, but well worth the effort.

This was my first time eating Afghan food and I am a fan. It&#39;s very similar to a lot of other middle eastern food.We went with a large group and people mentioned the Helmand in Boston (apparently there were some people from Boston among us).My boyfriend and I shared the Kaddo -- pan fried then baked baby pumpkin seasoned with sugar and served on yogurt garlic sauce, topped with ground beef sauce. It was very tasty. Sweet and savory at same time.My girlfriend and I both ordered the Kofta Kabab, which was ground beef mixed with green onion, fresh cilantro, garlic and hot pepper then grilled, served with sauteed eggplant and challow (rice). I loved it.The atmosphere is lovely, with National Geographic type photographs on the wall and dim but not too dim lighting.I would definitely come back.

The food here is so delicious--the lamb dishes are all superb, as is the vegetarian platter. The free sauce and rice are well-seasoned and complement the main dishes well. The free bread is hearty, satisfying, and great for dipping into the meat/veggie sauces. On chilly nights, nothing warms me faster (and better) than a hearty vegetarian platter from Helmand.

Some of my favorites include the vegetarian kaddo (pumpkin), aushak (leek &amp; scallion ravioli), kofta challow (meatballs), and lawand (sauteed lamb). While you&#39;re waiting for your meal, they serve warm bread with 3 different dipping sauces (a hot red sauce, a mild green sauce, and a yogurt based sauce), all of which are delicious. YUM.

If you&#39;re reading these reviews and you&#39;re like &#34;Baby pumpkin? Covered in meat sauce? WHAT?&#34; Let me tell you: THESE PEOPLE KNOW WHAT THEY&#39;RE TALKING ABOUT. We were SOLD after just one bite.Between us we had the baby pumpkin (phenomenal) and the ravioli (solid, but couldn&#39;t compare to the pumpkin) appetizers, Qabelee (the lamb was perfect, but I was surprised that this was a sweet dish...it was unexpected, but once I was a few bites in, I really enjoyed it), Mantwo (I think we were expecting puff pastry or something, but it was really a plate full of well-stuffed ravioli type things...the flavor, again, was unexpected and we couldn&#39;t figure out what the spices were, but it was very good), and the baklava (this aint your standard Trader Joe&#39;s baklava).A few observations:* It&#39;s fancy enough for a date but also appropriate for groups.* Strange decor. It&#39;s like Afghanistan-meets-George Michael or something.* The other diners were all over the spectrum: young, earthy couples and snooty looking couples older than my parents, but most were somewhere in between.* We lucked out and got a table without a reservation but we got definite &#34;next time make a reservation&#34; vibes from the hostess.* Service was kinda slow, but the people watching was A++.All in all, 4.5 stars, but I&#39;ll round up to 5 because it&#39;s unique enough that I&#39;ll probably be back.

I went here with a group fromcouchsurfing.com. There were 20 of us and we asked them to bring an assortment of food for us to eat family style. We each paid 21 dollars. Maybe it was the fact that I&#39;ve lived in India or that I have eaten a lot of Pakistani food but I wasn&#39;t that impressed with the food. I&#39;ve had afghani food before and found it to be more different and stronger spiced than the food served at Helmand. The highlight was the lamb dishes. none of the food was bad but nothing really stood out. Maybe it was because there were so many of us but the portions weren&#39;t huge.I think I will go back with just a couple of friends to try the dishes again.

walking past this place many times, you really have no idea how good it is, but with a couple of other adventurous souls we ventured in and... WOW!Ok, to start, the tables and chairs are super comfortable. The servers are afghani and know their food. and the food! We split 4 apps, the kaddo, the bowlani, banjan and mashawa. So good. the mashawa soup is great, and kaddo pumpkin is awesome!entrees we had the lamb rack, another lamb kabob dish, a beef dish and a chicken kabob dish, everything delicious. Also, the afghan naan and dipping sauces on the table add to the deliciousness. Go here now!

So disappointed. Their sister restaurant in Cambridge was one of our favorites. There, a large open room centered around a roaring oven churning out fresh delicious flatbread, wonderfully seasoned grilled meats, tasty unique veggie dishes, addictive trio of condiment sauces, consistent quality at reasonable prices.The SF version has an almost identical menu, but everything on the execution front is a mere shadow of the east coast&#39;s. We found this to be the case at the North Beach location years ago and sadly the new spot hasn&#39;t changed our opinion, despite our desperate hope that it would.For starters, the place smelled rather strongly of must. My spinach-based dish was utterly lacking in the rich seasonings and flavors that I had come to expect, and the rack of lamb, a favorite in Cambridge, was an puny, overcooked disappointment -- and at a higher price too. Even the flatbread, a fresh-out-of-the-oven highlight of the meal back east, fell flat here. It tasted fresh-out-of-the-toaster.Not all was bad. Our beloved kaddo, a sweet pumpkin dish with yogurt and optional meat sauce, was just as good as we remembered, and an absolute joy. Extra star just for that.Overall though, I was hoping the new space and fresh start would bring a new, better quality era in this city&#39;s version of one of our favorites, but sadly it remains a rare case of a Boston restaurant outperforming its SF analog.

This place was great when it was in North Beach and its just as good now down on Van Ness...Afghan food sounds super exotic by nature and might scare some away don&#39;t like to try different things, but the food is prepared with the delicacy of any well done Western Cuisine.The beef tenderloin medallions are fantastic and the ravioli type dish is awesome.Servers are always friendly, the only reason I don&#39;t give 5 stars is the focus on their 2 rice sides that are well, rice (they come with every entree) and many items on the menu are similar to each other (at least with the entrees). If there was a 4.5 star setting, that would be my pick.P.S. I waited 10 minutes in valet spot after trying to park for 20. Take a bus like I should have.

A hidden Afghan oasis on Van Ness. Quiet setting with attentive staff. Really had a good time trying a different type of food for the first time. Both appetizers I ordered were great -- the Aushak and the Kaddo were amazing, and the Mantwo looked really good, though I didn&#39;t have that one. There are a lot of dishes with lamb, so you&#39;re in luck if you enjoy lamb here. Didn&#39;t care for the flavor in the koufta challow, meatballs in sauce, as it was too salty for my liking, but next time I&#39;ll order something else.

This place has the funniest vegetarian menu. Every dish listed as an appetizer is also an entree. OK - that works.I loved the aushak (raviolis) - which were smothered with some yogurt sauce. The flavors really reminded me of chaat.Good place to go when people have a mix of dietary restrictions.

I finally got to go to this place because it has finally re-opened after its mud slide months ago. I was just starting to give up hope.I admit I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve had Afghani food before, but the Helmand did not disappoint at all!They started us out with some bread and three different sauces: red (spicy), white (yogurt), and green (mint/cilantro?). All were different and delicious.For an appetizer, we got the grilled eggplant, which was great. They have the most amazing, great-quality beef there. Definitely try it. They also had a lamb and lentil curry with pumpkin. Be sure to get your entree with pullow (a very flavorful type of rice).I&#39;ll be sure to go back. The place is tasty with friendly service.

This place was soooo good! It&#39;s quiet, warm, and cozy with great service and delicious food - just what you need on a rainy Friday night. I tried the veggie special plate and while I&#39;m not a fan of eggplant and cooked spinach, the pumpkin was great and went well with rice and the sauces. Mantwo and aushak appetizers were very good too, I almost wish I got that instead of the veggie plate! Bowlawni were ok. For dessert we had home-made coconut ice cream and turkish coffee (that they make right in front of you!). The only thing I didn&#39;t like was the stuff floating in my coffee, I guess it was some sort of spice but it made drinking the coffee pretty awkward.

What this place lacks in charm and decor, it makes up for in delicious food. The starter bread and sauces let me know I was in for a good meal. I had the lawanda, which was delicious. If you&#39;re a fan of Northern Indian food but uncertain about Afghan food, this would be a good dish to bridge the gap. I also tried the &#34;ravioli&#34; and the boneless chicken, which were also good. For dessert I had the cream pudding topped with cardamom and fruit, also delicious.To get five stars from me, they&#39;d need to have friendlier waiters (there were several standing around for ten minutes after we had shut our menus and started staring into space), a less grubby bathroom, and more human-sized chairs (I felt like a little kid wearing a huge coat).

I have been to the old Helmand location on Broadway in North Beach 3 times and on my last trip to SF, stopped by the new location. I miss the old brick walls of the Broadway location, but the rest of it was still as incredible as ever.Kaddo...still the most sensual dish I have ever tasted. I sent a roommate here for a first date a number of years ago and he agreed that he wanted to roll around in it. The fish was perfectly cooked and spiced. Great wine, a wonderfully cardamom-infused coffee to end it all, just perfect.Keep it up, guys.

I went to this lecture once, where this old guy talked about Aghanistan. He told us about this preservation method the Afghanis used where they&#39;d make little discs (clay pigeons if you will) out of horse shit and then they&#39;d put grapes in the middle of the discs and then burry them. The grapes were preserved for months. They just wouldn&#39;t go bad.This place doesn&#39;t offer horse-shit grapes, but they do offer many other delicious, delicious dishes.Being Iranian, I spend a lot of time trying to convince people that our cuisine is better than Arab cuisine (this comes after a 15 minute explanation that our cuisine is actually different from Arab cuisine). Apparently, Afghani food is better than Iranian food.If only they could be economically self-sufficient selling Naranj Polow instead of Heroin....sigh.

Yummm.... Who knew Afghani food was so freakn good?Friend and I split the Aushak appetizer, which are delectable non-italian raviolis (think fresh pasta wrapped around ground meat in a bed of succulent yogurt sauce), and they were pretty good but not as good as the Kofta Challow that I ordered (Meatballs with a spicy tomatoey vegetable sauce and a large side of long grain rice).Oh that was like heaven.Friend ordered Kourma (sauteed lamb with veggies and rice) and that was delicious as well.Bread! The flat bread is warm and comes with three dipping sauces... all excellent.I will definitely come back with a hearty appetite.

So far, I have been here twice and I love it. I like the authentic Aphgan / Iraqui decor and pictures on the walls and the quite atmosphere. The food is definitely different, so if you want to surprise your company with food, they will be, unless they are well familiar with Aphgan cuisine.Pumpkin with yogurt appetizer is delightful, and so is garbanzo beans salad and bee/rice entrees.It took quite a while to get the food, but considering that I had a party of 17, it is expected. You certainly will not feel rushed in this place.

Lamb lamb and more lamb. Call ahead and ask them to prepare for you Naranj Palow with lamb. It is not on the menu but they will make it for you if they have time in advance. There are Large servings. Get the pumpkin kaddo, and the aushak. And get the ferni for desert. You will leave fat as a pig.You will make this place the spot to take your parents when they are in town. Unless you are from the dreaded mid-west, then you will prolly take them to an Applebees equivalent.

Once again Helmand did it for me, My family and I have been to this restaurant half dozen times. Every time we have ordered different dishes and so far not been disappointed with any of their dishes. The place has a cozy environment and service is great. You should definitely try the rack of lamb it is to die for, make sure you don&#39;t bite your fingers while eating the appetizers. I concur with (Emily C) the last poster every appetizer has it own distinct aroma and great taste. Keep in mind appetizers are not the only thing Delicious there, every entree so far I have tried has been great.I have to give them a 5 otherwise it would not be fair.

Is there a 6th star? Like an orgasm meal star or something? Because this place gets it. Seriously.I don&#39;t even bother with the entrees - though I&#39;ve heard those are quite good - because I don&#39;t ever want to get past the appetizers. Here&#39;s my method - order every appetizer on the menu for my friends and I to share. Except the baby pumpkin. We all get our own baby pumpkin because I AM NOT SHARING MY BABY PUMPKIN. Not with anyone, not ever.And then, as much as I would like to go into the kitchen and eat my way out of a giant vat of baby pumpkin, I try to save room for dessert, because dessert is very good also. Feereney is my favorite. Get the Turkish coffee too. You&#39;ll be up all night but it will be worth it for remembering the sweet, sweet taste of baby pumpkin.And please get some wine with dinner, it makes it so much better. And tip well, it&#39;s a family owned restaurant and Mohamed the manager will remember you. Maybe the other Mohammed will look kindly upon you too. Then again, he already has, he&#39;s given you baby pumpkin.

Helmand serves good lamb and fish dishes AND they have a lunch buffet on weekdays.This location is pretty small, not as fancy as their orginal location in Boston. The food, however, is as good and authentic.You might want to come for their weekday lunch buffet if you are new to Afghan food and want to taste many dishes. It is a good change of palates for your lunch rotation.

Without question this is my favorite restaurant in SF.You start with three great dipping sauces and i like to end with a turkish coffee (complete with a little show). The Kaddo is the best thing i have EVER tasted and there are so many veggie options.Casual, but not too casual; perfect for a regular-saturday-night meal out (if you are like me and never eat at home) and the waitstaff is always really pleasant.I really love this place and i am so happy that it has reopened.

came here last night. the first thing i saw on the wall was a framed sheet of paper with the award claim that they were the &#34;best resurrection.&#34; all of the food smelled really good and looked really good but i didn&#39;t actually end up eating any of the main courses. i just ate the ravioli appetizer which was tasty, however the sauce on top tasted like Italian bolognese. the bread they gave at the beginning with the three sauces (red, white and green) were all very good in consistency and taste. so based on the smell of things and the small amount of tasting i had, i would agree that the resurrection of the place seems to have done them well. hopefully i&#39;ll get a chance to come back and actually eat next time.

Ditto Darcy&#39;s review - this place is delicious and I&#39;m so glad that they have found a new home not terribly far away from their previous location on Broadway. The new location is very similar in decor and layout to the old one which I like.For about 10 bucks plus tax, you should come here for the reliably tasty lunch buffet - I usually pile my first plate with so much that I barely have room for seconds (but somehow manage nonetheless). Tasty sweet pumpkin, curried vegetables, mint and yogurt sauced lamb, chicken, and veggies, okra in a tomato-spiced sauce, lots of basmati scented rice and a tapioca-style pudding for dessert.The service is polite if a bit formal for lunch, but definitely always cheerful and prompt. A nice spot for an informal business lunch meeting.

This place ranks pretty close to the top of my top ten list. And yes, this is where you could have found me on each of my last two birthdays. There I was, sandwiched between strip clubs on Broadway, eating what I always eat at Helmand: kaddo to start, a theeka kabab with extra lentils, and Diet Coke in a fancy glass.I can&#39;t do anything but rave about the service (I don&#39;t even have to ask for the extra lentils anymore) or the value (appetizers under $5; entrees under $15). Even the magazines and mints out front get my seal of approval.

I was so happy to see that the Helmand re-opened. I had only eaten at the old location once, shortly before it closed, but it was one of the best meals I&#39;ve had in the city. So earlier this week we headed over to the new place to see if it was as good as we remembered.We weren&#39;t super hungry, so instead of entrees we got several appetizers and sides. We had the salata with pomegranate dressing, kaddo, aushak, mantwo, and laghatac. Just as everyone else says, the kaddo is amazing. I was a little wary because pumpkin isn&#39;t one of my favorite foods, but after reading all the rave reviews, we had to try it. Man, am I glad we did. It&#39;s delicious. I&#39;ll just leave it at that.Everything else was really good (Except the salad. It&#39;s just...salad. With pomegranate dressing.), but not as memorable. I had tried the aushak before and remembered it being really tasty. The other dishes were new to me. Next time I go, I&#39;ll probably try something different. Not because there was anything wrong with what we got, but because there are so many yummy-looking things on the menu. I&#39;ll have to check out the lunchtime buffet sometime soon so I can sample more dishes.

Pretty much any food that comes from an exotic-seeming country is going to do well in a city like San Francisco. It&#39;d be tough for the Helmand to mess up their monopoly on Afghani cuisine here.Fortunately, I went with two friends who have been living in Afghanistan for a combined 5 years, and got the low-down on this place.They start with a serving of naan, which is an absolute staple, say my friends. Every meal starts with naan, including breakfast there. The sauces are great, with the obligatory yogurt-mint sauce and a few other spicier numbers. But the bread is too leavened; in Afghanistan it would be flat, flat, flat (sayeth the friends).I ordered the fish with sundried tomatoes. But then I was reminded (by the friends, natch), that Afghanistan is a land-locked country and therefore fish is nearly impossible to come by. It was too late to change my order. I enjoyed it nonetheless.One friend (neither of the All-Knowing ones) ordered a beer with his meal. However, Muslims are not allowed to drink alcohol and therefore it wouldn&#39;t be served in a restaurant.Not to mention, there would be no white tablecloths and probably no tables.Basically, the Helmand is a way to feel like you&#39;re being cultured while not leaving the comfort of luxurious San Francisco.But here&#39;s the krux: it IS interesting food, and I am just as much a sucker for feeling cultured as the next guy. So whatever. Why not stop by after you&#39;re done at Larry Flynt&#39;s or something.UPDATE: I recently learned that The Helmand is run by Hamid Karzai&#39;s brother, Mahmoud! Check Wikipedia; it seems to be legit.

Don&#39;t be scared by the Van Ness appearance. Helmand is a great restaurant and worth a try! GET the KADDO! Amazing melt in your mouth pumpkin with a wonderful beef sauce. These two combinations, though odd- go fantastically together! I had never tried Afghanistan food and I&#39;m glad I did. The lamb is tender and juicy and accompanied by an amazing sauce.

Although located in a seedy area of on Broadway near the strip joints, this place has amazing food. Like really amazing.I&#39;ve never had Afghan food before...but I&#39;m glad I came here for my first taste of it. I&#39;m not a huge fan of lamb, but I have to admit that eating the lamb here was really good. In fact, I hate lamb...but this place made me like it. That&#39;s how good the food is here. The appetizers are wonderful, so make sure you load up on a few of them.Sure the decorations are somewhat cheesy and there aren&#39;t many seats available, but if I were to rank this restaurant solely on its food, this would definitely be one of the best places I&#39;ve been to.

I thought that the food here was just ok - nothing just special. I ordered one of the chicken dishes, which came with potato and roasted peppers. The chicken was sort of dry, and not too flavorful. The salad that came with it had too much dressing, and was mostly lettuce.The service was fair. We had a large party, but they seemed to pretty much ignore us.The dishes were mostly between $11 and $14. I thought that you got a fair amount of food for the money. Not a huge bargain, but hardly expensive.Maybe I just ordered a bad dish, but nothing about this place impressed me. I wouldn&#39;t go back.

I went to Helmand for a birthday dinner, so I had the opportunity to try a variety of their dishes. Definitely get the pumpkin dish, and the kofte kebab... but I wasn&#39;t that impressed by the aushak (leek ravioli)... it just didn&#39;t wow me. The beef tenderloin platter was better than the lamb platter, and the chicken dish we got (it&#39;s in an orange sauce and looks like tikka masala but doesn&#39;t taste like it) was nothing special. Oh and the decor? Shabby and outdated, but presentable. Go for the unique dining experience, not the romantic ambience. Prices were pretty reasonable too, but the portions are on the small side.

I just went here for the second time (the first being in 2004), and had forgotten just how good this place is. Everything -- from the bread they bring to your table at the start of your meal to the desserts -- tasted great, although the pudding with fruit we had for dessert looked a little tired (but still was quite good!).This time around we only had appetizers (the ravioli stuffed with leeks and scallions, the pan-fried pastries filled with leeks, scallions and spicy potatoes and the cauliflower with tomatoes), but from my previous visit I remember the entrees being excellent as well.Based on the other reviews, it sounds like I need to make it in for their buffet one of these days! Too bad I work on the peninsula...

The Afghan restaurant&#39;s flavorful mint, yogurt and chili sauce combo nearly launched out my left nostril in response to my &#39;is this a date or a hang out dinner&#39; partner&#39;s personal info confession. Thankfully, the lush Tempranillo Rioja we were drinking had taken effect reducing my &#34;Should I pretend to go to the car and not come back&#34; to &#34;Oh, sure...It&#39;s all good.&#34;Had the leek ravioli starter with the meat sauce; all remaining sauce was sopped up with the basket of flatbread on the table. When dinner arrived, I slyly grabbed my companion&#39;s steak khebab dish because it looked better than my lamb stewy thing (menu spelling looked like tikka masala but I was still getting over my pal&#39;s info reveal to remember). Tried to subtly gobble up as much of the steak and rice before he piped up it was time to trade. The lamb was salty in comparison but still scrumptious.Nearly finished with a coffee and Kahlua from a nice offering of liquered coffee, ports and dessert wines, but thought the triple shot request would alert my &#39;date&#39; to my silent &#39;danger will robinson&#39; alarm system. Pleasantly surprised by wine list.

The food here was EXCELLENT. I mean, seriously, amazing tasting food. We shared one app - the kaddo - with pumpkin and ground beef sauce, and two entrees - the chicken challow (normally cooked rice) and the beef kebab (cardamom and nutmeg rice). It was some of the best food ever. If this is what Afghan food is like, I&#39;ll be finding more Afghan restaurants. The service wasn&#39;t perfect, but it was overall a very good experience, and i can&#39;t wait to go back. And all for $50 with tip and all!

I have been to this restaurant twice and on both occasions, I was leaving thinking &#34;I can&#39;t wait to come back.&#34; The food has always been absolutely delicious. My favorite dish would probably be their Mourgh Challow - amazing! Parking is a drag, but you can valet.

I thought this place was good. Nice service and lots of different dishes to try. I started with the vegetarian vegetable soup which had lots of spices to entice your palate. Then I had a yogurt and eggplant salad which was tangy and hit the spot. I find this place a great place to eat occasionally, especially when you want something different than the generic hummos or falafel.

Really great food and atmosphere. We split the kaddo appetizer, which was really great. We also had the ravioli appetizer, which was good but not memorable. The cauliflower appetizer was good too. Their naan is chewy and delish, and went perfectly with my lawdah. Absolutely stuffed!

Tried this place based on my fellow Yelpers - And was very pleased! Thanks everyone for a solid recommendation!Food is delicious and the service is warm, friendly and professional (The vests the servers wear are a nice touch too). The entryway could use some work - you encounter the bar when you first enter the restaurant, and it looks like they use it mostly as a work station; looks a bit shoddy and uninviting. But once you enter the dining room, the atmosphere improves tenfold - I liked the wall mural, the decorations and place settings. But, back to the important part - the food! I am vegetarian, and had plenty to choose from; there is a whole veggie section on the menu. I had a sampler plate as an entree - and yes the baby pumpkin IS that good! We tried some ravioli-type things as an appetizer and they were tasty as well. The only &#34;eh&#34; item was the side of spinach we ordered - had the choppy consistency of frozen spinach and was a bit salty. But everything else shined, so whatever. I&#39;ll be back! I want to save room for dessert next visit.

Man, what a great place to eat and very affordable.Kadoo gets a lot of raves, and it&#39;s well deserved. Our server recommended anything with lamb, and it did not disappoint either. It&#39;s not the most mind-blowing meal you&#39;ll ever have, but it&#39;s spicy, fresh, well prepared, and very interesting. Most of all it&#39;s absurdly affordable, and I thought the chairs at the table were exceedingly comfy.

Rejoice! The Helmand has risen from the ashes (or boulders, in this case)! New location is on Van Ness between Green and Union. It re-opened on 10.2.07. It&#39;s now called Helmand Palace, but it&#39;s the same owners, same food (maybe even better), same art on the walls. Pumpkin! Pumpkin! Pumpkin! And Lamb &amp; Pumpkin!

So glad Helmand is back! If you were fan of this place in the past, please go visit them on Van Ness. I&#39;ve been there twice now - once for dinner and once for lunch. The food is as outstanding as ever and the service is great. I went for dinner last week around 8pm on a weeknight and we were the ONLY people in there. Please help out the Helmand so they don&#39;t ever have to go away again!! If I have to part ever again with that sweet pumpkin dish on the lunch buffet I may die. Yes I&#39;m dramatic. And yes it&#39;s that good.

Holy crap! Super deliciousness at a very reasonable price. We had bolani, mantu, aushak, kaddo, banjan and dowpiaza. Everything tasted home cooked, including the three sauces they brought with the bread. The dumpling skin was pleasingly toothsome, the eggplant was amazing and the lamb was perfectly fall-off-the-bone tender. Well worth the haul out to Van Ness. If this place were closer to where I live, I&#39;d be eating aushak every day.

I couldn&#39;t not try the Kaddo after so many people have recommended it on Yelp. I also asked for the bread and sauces to try out. All very good. I&#39;m excited to eat in with some friends and sample more of their menu in the future.

I have tried most of the dishes over the years and can say I&#39;ve never had a bad meal.

The co-owner&#39;s brother is the current president of Afghanistan, Hamid Karzai. Free parking at 468 Broadway. Specialty here is lamb served 3 ways, but you should also try the mantwo beef dumplings, the kaddo pan-fried pumpkin, the aush noodle soup, the dwopiaza grilled lamb, the koufta meatball stew, the theeka kabab prime rib, and the feereny pudding.

The first time trying Afghan food and our group of 4 was blown away about how delcious it is. This is a great spot for vegetarians and lamb eaters alike. Check out the delectable leek stuffed ravioli in a tangy yogurt sauce. The pumpkin is so good as is the eggplant dish. The wine selection leaves somewhat to be desired. The atmosphere gives a sense of the culture. If you like Middle Eastern or Indian you will like this cuisine. A hit for sure! The people were super friendly too.

I&#39;ve been there a few times and always order the vegetarian aushak - light ravoilis with scallions and mint, a yogurt sauce, tomato, and lentils/beans on top. I always love it! Before dinner they bring you flat bread with 3 sauces - yum. My regular dining companion enjoyed his lamby-stew. Ms. K ordered sea bass, which seemed a little odd with potato, rice, and black-eyed peas. Her only comment was &#34;It sure is exotic!&#34; which I think means she didn&#39;t like it, but who knows why. Its a cozy place (except that ugly ceiling) and the service is very nice.

Definitely recommend to anyone looking for wonderful Afghani food.

This used to be one of my very favorite restaurants in SF. The grilled rack of lamb (chow pan), the charbroiled leg of lamb, and the prime rib beef skewers are really excellent, rich and subtle at the same time. I don&#39;t usually like pumpkin, but theirs I will eat. Both eggplant dishes are usually really good too.The &#39;rents took me there for my birthday dinner recently. The hubby, sister and her boyfriend came along too, so there were 6 of us. My sister&#39;s boyfriend and my husband don&#39;t like cauliflower, but they loved it there. Everything tasted great as usual, except for the eggplant which was old, bitter and had too many seeds.However, the service has gone way downhill. They used to have an older waiter captain at the helm, and he seemed to make sure the service matched the oldfashioned dining room in courtesy and somewhat oldfashioned, un-rushed formality.I didn&#39;t seem him this time. The waiter didn&#39;t recognize the wines we ordered, unless we pointed them out on the wine list. The secondary servers rushed through service. We shared 6 entrees among us, so we could taste everything. My mother was still finishing her food, and they were already picking up the not-empty plates and slapping down dessert menus.To add insult to injury (hee), they added an automatic 20% gratuity (not the usual 15% for parties of 6 or more) on top of the bill, *after* taxes!!!Fortunately, the food is still excellent (or we&#39;d be really pissed), and I love the oldfashioned, quiet dining room, but I&#39;m not sure the service is worth going back for.

Fabulous.....great flavors, great textures. Unfortunately I do not remember what i ordered my first time around here, but it was good enough to come the 2nd time. Came here yesterday and had the aushak and kaddo for appetizers, ordered the Chowpan and Mourgh Kabab for entrees. Was not disappointed by any of the dishes. Well, except for the fact that the Chowpan is somewhat expensive, but I will admit well cooked. The Chowpan is $22 and just comes with 3 small to medium size lambchops. Somewhat sad for such an expensive plate, but I&#39;m sure I&#39;ve paid for more expensive less satisfying meals in SF. Overall, a good experience. Service can be a little slow here.

This place has the best raviolis I&#39;ve ever tasted. Oh wow. I&#39;m thinking about them now. And that was just the appetizer. For my entree I had the beef meatballs. There were only two of them, but they were perfectly spiced and tender, and a wonderful accompaniment to probably the most beautiful long-grained rice I&#39;ve ever seen. Staff were friendly, too-- we had to wait a while for a table since we didn&#39;t have a reservation, but the host sent someone over to serve us drinks while we were waiting in the lobby.

The food is delicious, with plenty of lamb offerings. Went here on a Friday night and was able to get a table for two without reservations and with only a five minute wait. Noise is moderate, as the tables are close together, but grading on a San Francisco curve, it&#39;s not bad. Service was good, but it was hard getting the check at the end of the meal. Veggie options centered around eggplant and pumpkin.

I had dinner with an Afghani friend here last night and I was very impressed. It had been a while since he&#39;d been able to enjoy home cooking so we went a bit nuts on the ordering and left with very full bellies. We started off with the Aushak and the Bowlani, which were both very delicious. The sauce on both was outstanding and perfectly flavored. For entrees we had the Koufta Kabob and a chicken kabob. The Koufta kabob was my favorite thing I had all night - the flavor with the cilantro was impeccable. The eggplant that accompanied this dish was to die for. They seemed to use a breast for the chicken kabob and though the flavors were spot on, the appearance was a bit more cubed or processed than it seems it should be. To top it off we each enjoyed a Turkish coffee and some pistachio ice cream which really hit the spot. I will definitely be back anytime my pallet craves some good authentic food from the Middle East.

Having never been to Afghanistan, I can&#39;t say for sure if this place is truly authentic, but it sure convinced me. Recommend: pumpkin ravioli, lamb pallow, and some pretty high-production value Turksih coffee. Knowing that the place is run by the Karzais, I was speculating as to where the secret escape tunnel from the building was -- entertaining.

oh helmand...when will you come back to us? does nature really want me to miss out on the only afghani buffet place i know of in the city? how i lament the cruel rocks and cliffs of north beach... even the strip club next door has reopened.

the first time i went to helmand, i remember being blown away. last night, the food was quite good, except that my aushak reminded me of leeks in chinese dumpling wrappers. the food was well done, the service impeccable, and i was surprised to see it empty on a saturday night. we enjoyed our dishes, and liked their intense wine selection. it&#39;s worth a visit.

not much for ambiance, but good tasty spicy vegetarian dishes and a nice break from everything else in north beach.
