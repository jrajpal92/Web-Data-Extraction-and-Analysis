On a short getaway out of town, my wife and I were told to try this place as it came highly recommended. I&#39;d actually give this place a 4.5 star rating if that was an option. Here&#39;s the rundown...Ambiance:Has romantic vibes with dim lighting. There is a bar on the right side when you walk in with some high table seating. Otherwise, most of the seating is normal table setups with dark wood furnishings. The chandeliers were also very pretty.Service:Our server was friendly and offered great descriptions of the food options. He gave his favorite dishes and was upfront about how much food would be good for the both of us. No pressure to order alcohol or dessert. He along with the bus boys were attentive to check in on us and keep our drinks refilled. One slight knock would be that the food took a bit longer to come out than what we&#39;d consider normal.Food:Every dish was delicious. We started with the Vada Pav, which are tasty vegetarian sliders made with a potato based patty. We then shared the White Truffle Masala Dosa and the Chicken Dum Korma. Both were great, but if I had to choose one to have again it would be the Chicken Dum Korma. The curry reminded me of Tikka Masala but with a lighter flavor. The dark meat chicken was so tender and juicy with flavor.Final Thoughts:We&#39;d definitely eat here again when in the mood for Indian cuisine. I&#39;d be curious to try the other Dosa options on the menu. One thing to note is if you want a soft drink, they are served in bottles so there are not free refills.

I was really split between giving this place a 3 or 4 stars, but eventually I decided I had to go with a 4 -- it was good food, after all.DOSA is a great place to try out some authentic South Indian food and as someone from that part of the country, I really liked the food but one thing bothered me.The portion size.We ordered the Thali and got very little rice. So little there wasn&#39;t enough to mix it with most of what was provided with the meal. When I&#39;m paying $20, I&#39;d expect more than just one tiny cup of rice and the fact that you can&#39;t get refills just makes this terrible value, imo.The taste and service were top-notch. I see there are some mixed reviews about the service here, but maybe I didn&#39;t dine during a peak hour. We constantly had someone taking care of us and recommending stuff to try out.

Stellar service. Our waiter was clear and concise. He asked if we&#39;ve ever dined there before and went from there. Explaining the difference in the style of food and made some personal recommendations of what and how much to order. He was never afraid when we asked about two dishes which he would choose and why.We went with the prix fixe because we were hungry and weren&#39;t sure what to order.I started with the lamb slider...my goodness this was friggin delicious. Soft sweet bun, slightly spicy sauce and cooked to perfection.Then had white truffled dosa. This was also good. The sauces meshed everything all together.By the time the pork chop with lemon rice came I could only have a few bites. This was also very delicious but I had them box it so I could enjoy the next round...dessert.The carrot cake. Now this isn&#39;t your standard but wow when you scoop it all into one bite, perfection.Don&#39;t take my word for it, try it all for yourself. Delicious.A tad pricey but you should already know this before even stepping in. The place looks like a million bucks.

I had dinner here two Mondays ago with a friend who was visiting from out of town. I am generally not a huge fan of Indian food, but since my friend expressed a desire for Indian food, I brought him to DOSA.I wasn&#39;t sure how busy it would be, so I made sure to snag a reservation. When I looked a couple days prior, there were plenty of reservations available for Monday night. Originally reserved an 8:30 pm timeslot, but on the day of, we found ourselves free earlier than expected, and luckily I was able to change my reservation to 7:30 pretty last minute.I wasn&#39;t really hungry since I was sick and had little appetite, so my friend got one appetizer and we split a dosa. I didn&#39;t try his appetizer so I can&#39;t speak to that, but I thought the dosa was just okay.We stuck with the masala dosa since that was the classic dosa and we wanted to stick with something basic (though I was very intrigued by the seasonal pumpkin dosa I saw on the menu). The bread part of the dosa was fine, but the potato filling inside was overly salty and I couldn&#39;t enjoy it as much. I&#39;ve had dosas here before and I don&#39;t remember them being so salty, so maybe the chef that night had a heavy hand with the salt.For dessert, we ordered the sorbet flavor of the night which happened to be mango. It was a refreshing end to the meal.I like that DOSA has two floors. I&#39;ve been here for team dinners before and we would take up the entire second floor area with 25-30 people.We were able to find parking a block away on Fillmore. This area has mostly metered spots; there were a couple open spots Monday night, so parking wasn&#39;t too hard.

This fine establishment is the polar opposite of my favorite Indian (well, Pakistani) spot in SF, Shalimar. Whereas that joint is grimy, spare, and you&#39;re barely even noticed after you order, the service at Dosa is attentive and impeccable, and it&#39;s easily the most beautiful Indian restaurant I&#39;ve been in since Tabla.Not only is the room gorgeous, but the plates are also stunning (in addition to being tasty). They even make samosas look good, which is no mean feat. Among the starters, my favorite was the Chennai chicken, and I almost didn&#39;t want to cool my palate down with the yogurt in the Dahi Vida because the whorls of tamarind and mint were so damn lovely.Best of all, they don&#39;t turn down the heat for American palates. The spice in some of these dishes is no joke; I&#39;m not into spicy for spicy&#39;s sake, but when the flavor is there it&#39;s wonderful. The Steph Curry (a bourbon cocktail) had some heat, and the rub that they put on the lamb chops had me sweating, although I couldn&#39;t resist going back for more. The chicken dum korma was another winner, and from what I can tell from my friends around the table, just about everything was as well.This is basically about as nice an Indian meal you can have out, but you&#39;ll be getting a bill that reflects that as well.

I am so sad to be giving this place just 3 stars. Here&#39;s the run down -I understand this place gets crazy busy but not a good enough excuse to completely neglect your table. The staff is friendly but I was dying for a refill on my water and a second cocktail but they placed us on the upper deck and pretty much forgot about us.At a table of cocktail lovers, they really dropped the ball and missed some solid revenue because we were excited to try all of them!The FOOD though. It&#39;s so good. Hands down one of the most delicious Indian food restaurants I&#39;ve been to. Try all the variations of dosa - cannot go wrong with any of them. Also, try to vada pav and chennai chicken. I also recommend the #sarinotsari cocktail since like I said, I did get to try just one.One tip - please don&#39;t forget about your tables even if you place them upstairs. Thanks!

This is a good restaurant in need of a refresh. Looking a little sad inside, but still a popular spot on Fillmore. Once again enjoyed the duck appetizers, but was wisely wary about the accompanying curry sauce (very hot). Their food has not changed much since my last visit, served in plain bowls or platters without fuss. There was no evidence of food artistry or creativity in the preparation or presentation of these traditional Indian dishes.

Popped into DOSA last week for a quick happy hour and boy was I impressed. The happy hour menu is full of amazing small bites and cocktails for very reasonable prices. I had no idea. The last time I ate at DOSA was probably 5 or 6 years ago so I had basically forgotten how good the food was. I suppose I&#39;d have to thank Kabuke theatre for bringing me there because on Tuesday they have $6 dollar movie night and I was burning some time.I started with a delicious cocktail, the Bengali Gimlet. It had this curried nectar that really paired well with the gin and a nice citrus balance. Yum. As far as the appetizers go I ordered the following...- Spicy Vindaloo-style duck tacos: they were indeed spicy and I found myself sweating through my eyes. Delicious.- Chennai Chicken: I mean, who doesn&#39;t like fried chicken? The coriander and cumin made this dish complete.- Pappadum &amp; Chutney Sampler: I nice little variation of flavors with the crispy lentil wafers to dip.All in all, I think my bill was under $30 bucks for all this food and the one cocktail and I split all of this food with a friend as it was plenty! I would say this is one of the better happy hours I&#39;ve had in awhile.

I finally had a weekday off from work, which meant I could actually hit up a happy hour in my neighborhood. The man and I walked in right at 5 and plopped down at the gigantic bar.Everything at DOSA is enormous, from the high ceilings to the massive chandelier, to the large Shiva statue and other oversized decorations. Go big or go home seems to be the theme, and it carried over to the food as well.Happy hour starts at 5pm with drinks (1 beer, 2 cocktails, 2 wines) and from 5.30-7pm you can enjoy select appetizers at discounted prices as well. We started with 2 glasses of white wine and, once the kitchen opened, opted for the Tacos &#34;Frankie&#34; that were the winner of Taco Knockdown SF in 2015. Spicy Vindaloo-style duck and heirloom tomatoes nestled into an egg brushed roti taco and served with a side of creamy coconut chutney. These were killer! Perfect levels of spice and flavor. You get 3 tacos at happy hour for $9. We also had the pappadum &amp; chutney sampler for $4 - it comes with unlimited refills of the crispy lentil wafers and you get 4 chutneys. Our chutneys that day were mint, tamarind, roasted chile-garlic, and apricot. All completely different from one another and bursting with flavor.DOSA has a great cocktail menu and the ingredients in each are extensive and exotic. I tried their newest concoction, the Kerala Rhum Runner - Batiste Rhum, curried strawberry gastrique, creme de violette, mint, lemon, champagne for $13. My man chose the Steph Curry - Four Roses Bourbon, curried nectar, spiced agave, lime, Tempranillo for $13. Both were unique and damn delicious. All the ingredients come through at different moments when you&#39;re slurping these cocktails.We ordered some food of the regular dinner menu. You simply have to try a dosa when you come here as that&#39;s what they&#39;re clearly known for. All dosas get served with sambar (a lentil &amp; veggie dipping &#34;soup&#34;) and fresh coconut &amp; tomato chutneys. After consulting with the bartender on his favorites, we went with the Roasted Chile &amp; Garlic dosa. The mashed potatoes had the perfect consistency and the great spice kick that we were looking for. To cool our tongues a bit we also ordered the Dahi vada small plate. You get a bowl of cool organic Strauss yogurt over a large lentil fritter, all seasoned with tamarind, mint, and mild spices. I absolutely loved this dish and kept slurping yogurt with my spoon.Our two bartenders were awesome, talkative, and fun. One of them even gave us a sampler tasting of a new tequila that is made only with the tops of the agave plant as this can then regrow and makes for a much more sustainable tequila making process compared with the traditional way of chopping the whole agave plant off.We left with very rotund and happy bellies. Can&#39;t wait to come back to try some of their scallop and lamb dishes.

Love the white truffle dosa here. Drinks are tasty as well.If you&#39;re looking for a little bit of heat and meat, my boyfriend really enjoys the chicken korma.Tip: The korma and dosa actually pair quite well together! Spoon some korma over that dosa. When they make it good, the old-fashioned here is perfection!

A very cool modern twist to Indian food is what you will get at Dosa. The ambiance is very chic, they have bollywood music playing in the background, the hosts are ethnically dressed (they try) and the menu is traditional Indian but with a touch of westernization.I have been to Dosa multiple times. The one on Fillmore is definitely much bigger and busier than one on Valencia. During my multiple visits I have tried and loved each of the following: dahi vada, vada pav, egg curry, mysore dosa, masala dosa, the uttapa sampler and the cocktails! They get reaaaly busy on weekends so making a reservation is necessary unless you don&#39;t mind a long wait time. And all my servers have been amazing - very patient, friendly and helpful.

Third time in San Fran, third time here! This was our first lunch and it was delicious. In general the place looked great, service is amazing, and the food... just great.We had dosa (served with one of the best sambars I&#39;ve ever had), and a chicken curry. The curry was advertised with lemon rice, but came with plain jasmine. Here is the reason for 4 star. While the waiter apologized and actually brought a free lemon rice as well, the lemon rice was bad. My mother in law is from Tamil Nadu and has passed her recipes on to me. This was not good lemon rice. Week and not lemony in the slightest. Additionally, the chicken curry was bland.Take my word for it, the food here is creative and good. The lemon rice was a lone blemish on an otherwise glowing series of experiences.

5 stars for sure. The number of 5 stars reviews that I write have gone down sharply since I have started writing more reviews. I try to reserve them for something special and unique. This place deserves 5 stars for its combination of wonderful food and amazing ambience. I can nearly say that this place has the best ambience amongst the Indian restaurants that I have been to in the US, till now.For people of Indian origin, I would recommend this place for taking non-Indian friends out to and especially if you have to take your parents or relatives out for a meal. This will definitely be a place that will leave a good impression. For everyone, this is the kind of ambience and food that I want every Indian place should have. Gets busy over the weekend so make a reservation.Now that I have commented enough about other things let&#39;s get to the food.Appetizers: order the Fried Idllis, and chennai chicken. Both are nice and good.Main course: being named Dosa, we had to try some dosa&#39;s and they turned out to be pretty good. Over two visits we have tried Mung dosa, Rava dosa, and Paneer Dosa. I liked the Mung and Rava dosa more than the Paneer dosa. We tried some other entrees also: really loved the Prawn masala and the Channa Bhatura. If you don&#39;t want to have a dosa I would recommend either of these two. Both had wonderful flavor.Sweets: Ras malai was good.Mango lassi was also good.Enjoy the food and the environment.

I wanted to 5-star this spot, just like the one in the Mission.It&#39;s just the little things: I asked the hostess for a table where our little one could have a high chair and not be in the way. She was very accommodating, but then didn&#39;t bring us a high chair? I asked for chutneys for the pappadam (the usual coconut and red chutneys we ask for at Dosa on Valencia), and she offered me the chutney sampler). Maybe no one asks for those there? She obliged but seemed kinda annoyed.The food was great, although I&#39;m gonna keep it real, and say Valencia still edges them out in the taste and presentation of their dosas.

Awesome place but definitely make a reservation if you can! It&#39;s always packed (especially weekends and evenings). We actually came here because we tried to go to State Bird without a reservation (d&#39;oh) and didn&#39;t get in.But, this place was absolutely amazing with great food, great ambiance. Loved everything, but things do run a bit spicy. I asked the waiter about the sauces and he said &#34;it&#39;s not that spicy&#34;...it was very spicy (but I also have a very low tolerance for spicy stuff)Would definitely come back again and try out some other items on the menu!

I think I&#39;m one of the very few people who has given this place a low rating but I have a long story to narrate so bare with meBeing an Indian from south India I can say I have a very high standard of South Indian food. When I heard of this Michelin rated place called dosa I jumped with joy. My husband planned the perfect birthday evening for dinner at dosa. We got here with roaring appetites. We ordered drinks which were good and the famous vada pau. We then ordered the namesake- a chilli garlic dosa and that&#39;s when the blasphemy occurred. The dosa was soggy. Yes. It was not hot and seemed like it has been made that morning. N it tasted nothing close to the Michelin crispy goodness picture I had painted in my mind.Now fast forward 10 months to my close friends birthday. I was wary but decided to give dosa another honest chance. We got the tasting menu. I got the mung dal paneer salad(average) and the Utapam (good but not mind blowing). The lamb chops were inedible and the waiter recommended them. It was like an entire bottle of Indian all spice was dumped into that poor lamb. My husband got the veggie kofta from the tasting menu but was given a green beans curry instead. To top it off they said they said they&#39;d made a mistake and switched it with another item in the menu. But the green beans curry was not part of the menu. Not sure what they were trying to pull off there.Not cool dosa!On top of that the service was so slow that many people from our party had to miss their next engagement because they were waiting for their $55 meal for more than an hour. So disappointed.I don&#39;t know what the fuss is about.

I can&#39;t tell for sure, but I think it is heated up frozen kavan paratha!Service was very slow, we had to wait for 30mins+ for the main course.The staff was very nice and cordial as usual though. :)

TLDR - Delicious, flavorful South Indian food. Go for the dosas, maybe the appetizers, and skip the entrees. Definitely more on the fancy/trendy end of Indian food so expect to pay more than the classic Indian jointCame with a group of 5 for SF Restaurant Week on a Saturday night. Not sure if it was because of SFRW or if it&#39;s always like this, but this place was really busy. I could only get a reservation at 5:45pm or at like 9pm a few days in advance. We ended up coming at 5:45 and by the time we left around 7:30, there was a long line of people waiting to be seated.Ambiance here is very lively and energetic. There&#39;s a huge bar and some communal tables on the first floor and tables on two floors. Tall ceilings, dim lighting and chic decor scream nice and trendy.We decided to order 2 sets of the 3-course SFRW menu, 1 appetizer and 2 dosas to split between everyone for a total of 3 appetizers, 4 dosas and 2 other entrees, which was plenty to share. The menu can be a little overwhelming if you&#39;re not familiar with Southeast Indian cuisine. They&#39;re known for their dosas, which are large, crispy Indian crepes generally filled with potatoes and/or other fillings, all of which are served with coconut and tomato chutneys and a vegetable and lentil dipping soup. If you can&#39;t decide what to get, you can always opt for their seasonal prix-fixe tasting menu to help narrow down your options!Some of the portion sizes were pretty small, especially the appetizers, so they were a little hard for sharing. The dosas were very large and filling though, especially the masala (potato-filled) ones. I&#39;d recommend skipping the other entrees though. They were still good, but they were much more expensive than the dosas and rather small in portion size.Overall, everything was pretty tasty. Lots of flavor and all the meat dishes were cooked very well, but most of the dishes didn&#39;t leave a lasting impression. Standouts of the night were definitely the Green Mango &amp; Paneer Dosa (from the SFRW menu) and the White Truffle Masala Dosa. Definitely would want to return to try some more of their dosas.** APPETIZERS **-SHREDDED DUCK ($14) - 4/5[spicy vindaloo-style, chiles, ginger, garlic, vinegar, caramelized onion uttapam]Tender, spicy, flavorful.-COCHIN CALAMARI ($12) - 4/5[sauteed with mildly-spiced coconut milk]Super tender, lightly sweet, full of flavor-SOUTH INDIAN SEAFOOD CIOPPINO ($17) - 4.5/5[coconut stew, shrimp, mussels, calamari, scallops]Delicious! Light, fragrant, coconutty broth with a slight kick.** DOSAS **-GREEN MANGO &amp; PANEER DOSA - 5/5[spicy, pickled mango relish, shredded farmer&#39;s cheese, cilantro]MMM absolutely amazing. I don&#39;t know where the mango was in this, but it was lightly sweet and the cheese wasn&#39;t overwhelming. If you&#39;re not a fan of potatoes, this is definitely a good dosa alternative. Not quite as heavy as the masala dosas either.-WHITE TRUFFLE MASALA DOSA ($15) - 5/5[classic masala dosa, truffle oil]I love truffle oil so I loved this! But only the parts of the dosa that actually had the truffle oil.. The truffle wasn&#39;t very consistent in the dosa so a lot of it was just a normal masala dosa. But the truffled parts were delicious!-LAMB KEEMA DOSA ($15) - 4/5[plain dosa, side of minced lamb &amp; diced potatoes]The lamb was yummy, but as a dosa as a whole, it wasn&#39;t quite as special as some of the others. Worth a try, but if you&#39;re a more adventurous eater, it might be a little disappointing.-SPICY BASIL DOSA ($13) - 2/5[masala dosa, fresh basil chutney, cashew nuts, shallots, ginger, curry leaves, chiles]Meh. Tasted like a regular masala dosa to me. I don&#39;t think anyone in my group got any of the spicy basil part of it. No idea where that basil chutney was.. I&#39;d pass on this in the future.** ENTREES **-HYDERABADI LAMB BIRYANI ($31) - 4/5[basmati rice, spiced sauce, raita]The lamb was soft and tender, and the rice was nice and fluffy. Delicious overall, but for $31, I was definitely expecting a bigger portion size. At least more rice if not more lamb.-KERALA FISH MOILEE ($32) - 4/5[coconut milk, curry leaves, ginger, coconut rice]Wow, that fish was cooked soo well. So soft and moist. The curry part honestly was just okay, but the fish was definitely the star here. Again, small portion size for the price.

Everything about DOSA on Fillmore is outstanding!!! The food is excellent, the staff was helpful and really knowledgeable of the menu. The restaurant is a little dark, I felt like I almost had to read the menu with my phone&#39;s flashlight, but it&#39;s really beautiful inside.We started with vada pav and the Channai chicken. I had the spicy basil Dosa as my entree and would definitely recommend it. My friend also mentioned that all of the drinks really capture the essence of the Indian fusion style of the restaurant so I tried the Forbidden City. Definitely worth ordering.

I was blown away by the quality of food at Dosa. I have been to the Valencia location and had a good experience there, but this one is off the charts. When I first tried to get in here, I couldn&#39;t get a table since it was packed to the brim. So got a reservation (*pro-tip*) and went here a week after. Dosa was so worth the effort.I tried the Hyderabadi lamb chops and the rava masala dosa. The hyderabadi lamb chops were incredible. Really well made with a tamarind sauce on it. Amazing. The rava masala dosa was pretty good too. Won&#39;t rave about it since a lot has been said about the Dosas here already.For dessert I got to try the Kulfi and Rasmalai. zOMG. This is where dosa hit the ball out of the park. If you haven&#39;t yet, please do yourself a favour and try the Kulfi here. It will blow your mind, for sure.Give this place a shot if you haven&#39;t (or visit again if you have :D). Aaand get the Kulfi.

Having visited San Francisco and having lived on non-spicy food for days, we were in the mood for some spicy Indian food. We wanted to avoid the standard restaurants in the South Bay and focus on something in downtown. A friend of ours had recommended this place, so I was completely down to give it a try!DOSA has a very festive resort lounge vibe. There are huge ceilings with a very spacious bar area, couch seats like Starbucks, and then there&#39;s the main dining hall. The hosts were very professional - as soon as you enter, you are ushered in, seated and promptly handed the menu.I decided to go with the Mixed Chile Uttapam, which is a thick dosa-pancake with 3 types of chili. I was warned this would be spicy! I rounded up my meal with some ginger chai tea, which was great! They do take a while to bring out the orders, but once it came out, it was magnificent. Perfectly cooked, perfectly arranged and the chutneys and sambar they serve with the dosa were impeccable.I can&#39;t say enough good things about this place. It&#39;s bright, vibrant, and hip with good quality food. Whether it be for family dinners, birthday dinners, or casual get togethers, it makes for an excellent place to gather.

I ate here over a year ago while on vacation and I am still thinking about it. This was one of the best meals of my life. If they are still offering the 3 course meal, I would highly recommend doing that so you can try several items. I can&#39;t remember exactly what I had but I know the first course was soup, the second had paneer, and the final course was spicy shrimp. By the last course I was so full, I wish I could have taken food home but alas with traveling that does not work. The drink menu is also amazing and very unique. I had some sort of gimlet that was spicy, and it was crazy good. This place is a must visit, and make a reservation it gets packed!

Ambiance (5/5): Walking into this place, I had no expectations. My gf just said it was a nicer Indian restaurant, so I just expected that. Boy was I wrong. This place is super chic. Besides the cool artwork hung around the area, or the chandeliers above, I was enamored with my experience here just looking around. My personal favorite was the automatic door in the front. Definitely a nice surprise.Service (4/5): Our server was extremely sweet. She was very patient with our decision-making process on what to order as well as checking in with us from time to time. I did like how since we did order more than our table could hold, she actually staggered the meals so that we could have ample space to enjoy one, and promptly have the next one as soon as we finished. Also, another kind gentlemen came by for our drink orders while we were waiting to be seated. How rad is that to be treated well even before your seated.Food (4/5): We shared the idli fries, sweet potato dosa, and lambed keema dosa. The fries were coated with this powder, which had a nice kick to it. The sweet potato dosa came out first and I loved the presentation. The sweet potato filling was hidden inside the nicely wrapped dosa. I liked the sponginess of the dosa, rather than the crispy sections. But that&#39;s just my preference. The sweet potato still had a savory flavor to them that I really enjoy. Plus the chutneys that came on the side also was a nice touch. We were pretty full by the time the lamb keema came out. I was a tad disappointed since the lamb was really finely diced, so you don&#39;t get the texture of the meat, but you can still taste it. It was a bit spicy, but we did enjoy it as well.Drinks (4/5): I normally don&#39;t order drinks, but somtimes you have to treat yo&#39;self. Being a huge Warriors fan, I knew I had to go with the Steph Curry. My gf also ordered the mango is the new black. I will say these drinks are strong, so you do get your moneys worth. But I did enjoy both drinks and I could see why Steph Curry has been one of their more popular drinks.

Came on a Wednesday night with a group of about 20 (office holiday party) - they sat us upstairs, so we had a fantastic view looking over the main dining room and bar area. The decor and lighting here is gorgeous!The house cocktails revolve largely around gin and bourbons (like most of SF), but the rum-based Ginger Ante ($12) was great - dark rum mixed with ginger and ginger ale, decorated with a rosemary sprig. They also have wines, beers, a virgin mocktail list, lassis, and chai.The service here was friendly and helpful to our group. We got lots of great drink recommendations, and even though our menu was prix fixe, they were attentive to whether or not there were any allergies or diet restrictions in our group.I can&#39;t at all speak to how authentic/legit/real the food is - it looked and tasted like real food to me, it just wasn&#39;t really anything that I&#39;d be returning for anytime soon. Dosas are essentially potatoes wrapped in crepe and served with chutneys; this carb bomb was by far the best part of our meal, although reading other reviews makes me think I should come back and get my hands on an actual menu.Our first course was a brussel sprout dish that seems like it belonged with a Thanksgiving spread, and the none of the curries (lamb and shrimp) were finished. We ended up picking the shrimp out, and left a lot of the lamb.While there was good heat in a lot of the dishes we had, the flavors didn&#39;t particularly compliment each other, and it was weird receiving all of our food in courses. Given the prices of this place on a regular night, I can&#39;t really justify coming back on my own.If you&#39;re looking for a unique place with a beautiful atmosphere though, check em&#39; out!

I had such a good meal at Dosa on Fillmore, which is not usually something I&#39;m able to say about Indian cuisine. You see, as much as I love the flavors of Indian food, my wimpy digestive system can&#39;t take to the spices or spiciness too much, to the point where I always have to order &#34;tikka masala&#34; or some other basic bro choice.At Dosa, our waitress was very thoughtful about making suggestions for lovers and haters of spiciness alike, and I truly got to enjoy all of the delicious flavors of their food without regretting the meal later... if you know what I mean.What I really recommend is the tasting menu- at the time I went in late 2015, it allowed us each to select an appetizer, entree, and dessert, each at a smaller portion than the a la carte version. This made for a fun way to share a little bit of everything and see what we liked for next time. (I&#39;m Asian and need to eat family style and try EVERYTHING, so this was a win for me!) I loved the truffle masala dosa and trying the 5 different uttapams - each had a different flavor, and when dipped in the many sauces they provided, there were so many combinations that the whole meal felt pretty exciting.On top of the good food and opportunity to sample everything, the ambiance was really purdy- perfect for a date or special occasion.The cost was higher than most Indian food, but the service, selections, and atmosphere made it all worth it. (Not to mention they have a pretty good chai tea, too.) Highly recommended when you&#39;re in The Fillmore!!

Just had brunch here with friends.We ordered the Pani Puri to start with. Was fun to put it together on our own and was pretty good. For main course I had the Bombay eggs which was delicious. A little spicy but I loved it.My friend had the south omelet and he said it was good. Another friend had the Mung dosa which is what he gets all the time and said it was good.Will be back for brunch.

I was excited to try Dosa since it&#39;s so popular. It&#39;s an upscale restaurant with absolutely beautiful decorations and friendly service. Maybe we didn&#39;t order the right things but my boyfriend and I just thought the food was mediocre.They start by giving you a free serving of papad. I liked the crispy texture but I&#39;m not a fan of the taste. We ordered the cochin calamari for an appetizer ($12). The calamari was sauteed and came with a small uttapam (pancake version of Dosa) and salad. The dish was flavorful and unique.For entrees we each ordered a dosa. It comes with spicy lentil soup and tomato and coconut chutneys for dipping which were good. I got the white truffle masala dosa ($15) since I love truffles. The dosa was huge and crispy. I really enjoyed the potatoes inside but surprisingly neither my boyfriend and I could taste any truffle oil. My boyfriend ordered the paneer &amp; peas dosa ($14.50). It came in three sections and was packed with paneer. That probably wasn&#39;t the best entree order since it felt so heavy eating that much cheese and we weren&#39;t able to finish the dish. The first few bites of it were okay but I liked the white truffle masala dosa a lot more.

Jesus, the prices keep rising here and I&#39;ve noticed the quality has gone down. Their gin and tonic is one of my favorites since the first one I had with good ice cubes some years back. AT $12 I thought it was pricey. Now, the choppy ice they use isn&#39;t as good, and it&#39;s $14, plus $1 for tax and $1.5 for tip. That&#39;s $16.50 for one gin and tonic! It would take some 200,000 million people in India who make $2 per day one damn week hard labor to pay for this luxury-- and you need two to get any kind of worthy buzz. For God&#39;s sake! The papadum was soggy stale last time I was there paying $16.50 per drink-- but it was &#34;free&#34; I can&#39;t really complain. And I&#39;ve noticed some of the apps like the squid just don&#39;t taste as good anymore. The dosa are still great, especially the truffle. But as this type of food costs a buck or two in India, I&#39;m becoming increasingly adverse to this place. Sure I&#39;ll get talked into going again, but with regrets.My advice here: stick solely with the apps and dosa, and get your drink on before.

Love this place! The place is located right on Fillmore right next to the kabuki theatre. One of the best indian places in SF.Dosa is more concentrated on South India food with more a spicy kick than North Indian food. For appetizers I would start with the chennai chicken, minced chicken samosa, and the Frankie (very unusual for an indian restaurant - its like a taco shaped dish with duck, tomatoes, and chutney).For the main courses for spicy: Spicy Mung Dosa or the Lamb Keema. The dosas are perfectly cooked very crispy and served every variety of dipping sauces.The ambiance is great here it is like a palace style inside with dimmer lighting for dinner. Service is great, very friendly and funny.Recommend going there for any occasion - larger groups, dates, business outings, etc.P.S Make sure to make reservations it tends to get really busy during peak hours and on weekends.

My review here is for the bar only as we just stopped in for cocktails after having dinner elsewhere. The ambience at Dosa is upscale but chill and welcoming. The bartenders are very personable and friendly and after a short conversation about cocktails it is apparent they know their stuff. The cocktail menu has several speciality cocktails that are a fitting match to the theme of Dosa and are all quite nice and unique served in a decent portion size which has become rare in San Francisco. No half filled glasses here! Dosa was a great spot to hang and have a drink. I will deffo be back.

I am completely speechless! I did my research before coming here and when my meal was completed, I realized this restaurant more than exceeded all my expectations. I haven&#39;t stopped thinking about it ever since and I&#39;m already planning my next visit!Wow! From the moment we walked in, we were immediately acknowledged by the bartenders even though we didn&#39;t stop at the bar. We were seated upstairs (our choice) which was great because we had a wonderful view of the entire restaurant, which is aesthetically pleasing, decorated with amazing artsy chandeliers and in gorgeous hues of orange! Our waiter was super friendly and the service was great!We all ordered specialty cocktails. Mine was a gin and tonic, mixed with a house made fig and cardamom tonic. Best gin and tonic I&#39;ve ever had. We ordered many shared plates. They were nothing short of amazing!!!Spring Fruits and goat cheese salad---So good I had to order a second one! Visually beautiful with Strawberries, oranges, greens, peas, sweet roasted walnuts, goat cheese fritters, and edible flower petals in a spicy avocado coconut dressing! Superb!Sprouted Mung Bean &amp; Paneer Salad--with chunks of watermelon, tofu, mung beans, coconut and kale with a spicy Apple dressing. Yummmmm...So fresh!Five Moons Uttapam Sampler----just beautiful! Little pancakes with toppings. You dip them in tomato and coconut chutneys and lentil sambar (which is a hot lentil soup)Shikampuri Kebab Sliders--- minced lamb slider on a sweet roll with a spicy dipping sauce. My mouth was on fire but it was worth it!Chennai Chicken---Succulent shreds of deep fried chicken with a cool coriander cumin sauce. Mmmmmmmmmm!And as if that wasn&#39;t enough, our waiter brought us a complimentary dessert!!!Our tab was very reasonable and I left extremely happy!This was so worth coming all the way from Napa Valley for!! Like I said, I&#39;m speechless and happy to have found this restaurant. I&#39;m coming back as soon as I can!!! Thank you so much for enlightening me!

Came here with some teammates after a tiring day of work - we had reservations at the long table next to the bar which was convenient. We had many dishes that were vegetarian since many on our team don&#39;t eat meat. We started off with complimentary chips that came with 4 sauces - my favorite was the green one that had a kick to it. The samosas were delicious with the green sauce! Since everything was pre-ordered before I got there, I am unable to share the name of each dish, but I have photos that are attached! The second appetizer was almost like fries, but it was a fried vegetable (couldn&#39;t make out what it is) with chili powder all over making it quite spicy and crunchy. We started our course with pancakes that were all vegetarian - 5 pieces with each a different ingredient: mushroom, tomato, etc. I dove into the soup that came with the dishes which had a kick to it but it was sooooo good! Probably my favorite dish next to the chicken curry with naan! There was also a crepe that had lamb or pumpkin in it, but I didn&#39;t try the lamb and thought the pumpkin tasted a bit bland, but sauces and that bomb soup came with it so it made everything alllll better! The meal was delicious and very authentic with prompt service! Definitely worth a visit!

Good place with great Indian food. The decor is great. It has an excellent bar and the service is pretty good. This is a good recommendation for people who want to try authentic Indian food but worried about the spice. They keep the spice on a lower side but the authenticity of the dishes remains the same.The service is good and place is busy and crowded.

I love DOSA! It&#39;s a bit different than most of the Indian food that most of us are probably familiar with. It is South Indian cuisine so they don&#39;t use dairy.We had a few small plates (duck tacos, samosas and calamari) and they were all great. The tacos were a bit spicy so be warned if you don&#39;t do well with spice. The calamari was really good but it was small to split at our table of 6.We have the truffle uttapan, the lamb dosa, shrimp masala and chicken curry. ALL were amazing.Definitely recommend this place!

I&#39;ve been here twice now. I really love this restaurant overall. I would give it five stars for decor and service. It&#39;s gorgeous inside and they play nice music in the background. The menu has beautiful choices of traditional dishes as well as interesting fusion dishes like black truffle dosa. Hmmmm!We&#39;ve tried and loved the Chennai chicken, vada pav, paper masala dosa, and uttapams. Delicious!!!!! I can&#39;t tell you how great those things are. The only reason they do not get five stars is their chutneys. The coconut and tomato chutneys they serve with their dosas are both not very good at all. If they changed their recipes for these dishes I would easily give this restaurant five stars.

Sadly, I would not recommend Dosa on Fillmore to anyone for their Diwali celebration. I generally love Dosa, especially this location, so was excited to visit for Diwali with my husband for a nice, pre fixe dinner and a few cocktails. I haven&#39;t been in several months, so I&#39;m not sure if the decline in quality is broader than just this event. The summary is that the service was slow/rude and the food did not seem as fresh as it should have been.What went wrong:- Running behind on reservations, we had an 8:30pm table but were seated at 9:15pm- After delivering our cocktails, I asked the waiter to snap a quick photo from my phone. He said, &#34;Sure, I&#39;ll just be right back&#34; but then proceeded to enter an order in the computer and wait on other tables right in front of us - he never returned for the photo!- There was too long of a wait between the courses of the pre fixe menu, and many of the items delivered were luke warm and seemed like they had been sitting out for some time- There are only 3 choices of 2 items each on the pre fixe menu, yet one of them was incorrectly delivered to our table initially- We asked a server to pack two of our dishes and take away the rest - he stacked both the dirty dishes and the dishes to pack all in one go! While I understand that he would use a different spoon to empty the leftovers into plastic containers, it&#39;s still gross to stack them along with the dishes that you&#39;re going to discard. This was unprofessional and I would have preferred he take the dirty dishes and the leftovers separately- The worst part was when the server came back with our doggie bag - one of the curries was spilling out of its container! He took it back, replaced the bag and wiped down the container - but it was clear he didn&#39;t take care to replace the container altogether, as you could tell the curry was still spilling outWhat went right:- I have to say the cocktails were amazing. We ordered 4 in total and I&#39;d highly recommend 3 of them: Steph Curry, King Khan and Peony were all yummy

South Indian food is usually tough to introduce people to because the flavors are really different, but I love how Dosa makes it such a fun experience! It&#39;s a great place to bring people who haven&#39;t had dosas or south indian food before. The white truffle dosa used to be my favorite, before I tried the spicy basil one! I liked that much better. I think the white truffle dosa at Rasa does more justice to the truffle, so if you are looking for that flavor, I would save it for there. Ambiance is also wonderful, it&#39;s so bright and clean inside. The drink menu is another thing I love about Dosa. I love how they indianify your typical drinks. Overall, I would definitely recommend checking it out if you&#39;re in the area!

My feelings about Dosa on Fillmore are mixed. The pros: the ambiance and the interior design of the place are fairly pleasing. The place is upscale, posh, and has a swanky feel. It&#39;s a great place to grab drinks with friends. The cons: the food at Dosa has never wow-ed me. I haven&#39;t had anything I particularly disliked, but everything&#39;s been middle-of-the-road okay. My biggest complaint is that the food is pricey (especially given that it&#39;s not amazing).All in all, if you&#39;re looking for delicious flavorful Indian food in SF, look around because there are tons of other great options. If you&#39;re looking for a nice swanky place to get a couple of drinks, Dosa isn&#39;t a bad option.

We ordered the chutney sampler, paper dosa, spicy mung masala dosa, salty lassi, and achaar.Chutney sampler came with (oily) pappadum and 4 different kinds of Americanized chutney. Paper dosa was also very greasy. Spicy mung masala dosa was not bad, but also very greasy. Achaar was inedible. Overall, decent dosas but unfortunately grossly overpriced.

This place never fails to disappoint, and is fabulous for vegans! Just let the waiter know you&#39;d like to make the dish vegan-friendly, and he or she will accommodate you!I enjoyed their caramelized onion uttapam! It is crispy and light (no potato masala).Dosa&#39;s sambar is delicious and thankfully not a pool of oil. Their red and green chutneys are tasty as well.The winner of our brunch order though was the vada pav. It is sweet and savory at the same time because of its delicious tamarind paste. I absolutely loved it.This place gives a good twist to South Indian food. I love absolutely everything I&#39;ve tried on their menu and I would highly recommend it to anyone, regardless of their experience with eating South Indian food.

Indian food, in my humble opinion, is one of the most difficult foods to get right as it is. Therefore, whenever I find an Indian restaurant that experiments with innovative ideas and concepts, I am always intrigued because very few do it well.To be honest, I was initially drawn to this place because of their happy hour menu, specifically the idli fries. Unfortunately, there was not enough time before our reservation to enjoy the happy hour menu so we instead ordered the fries at our table. They were amazing! We also sampled the cocktails which were very innovative. I would definitely come here just for the happy hour menu!For the main dining experience, we all ordered the tasting menu that was featured for restaurant week with the wine pairing. Now, as any wine snob knows, pairing wine with Indian food is one of the biggest challenges in the world and few know how to do it properly. DOSA did know... The wines were not only amazing but they went REALLY well with the food. We got a mixture of items including kebabs, dosas, biryanis, fish, and chicken and they were all delicious.Amber India is still my favorite Indian restaurant in the Bay Area but DOSA is definitely the biggest competitor for them now. Amazing dining experience!

We had a reservation at 8:30 p.m. but we weren&#39;t seated until 9 p.m. The staff at the entrance was very friendly though and did apologize for the wait.The restaurant is beautiful. Loved the decor. The menu is so long, it is difficult to pick!I had heard such great feedback on Dosa but I guess I picked the wrong dish.I ordered the assortment of 5 uttapams &#34;South Indian Moons&#34;.Even if it was described as &#34;pancakes&#34;, I didn&#39;t expect to have actual pancakes in my plate. I didn&#39;t know this dish even existed and I expected more veggies on them, more flavor... I tasted only the pancake for each variety.I had a bathura on the side, thinking it would be like a thick naan. Wrong again, it was another (bigger) pancake!! LOL!My husband had a dosa, which was huuuuge. He liked it!For dessert, I had the indian gelato with cashews. Two scoops are served, it was pretty good.The wine options are quite expensive, no white wine bottle under 40$!We had one of the cheapest ones there and it was quite good, though.Our server was not super friendly but he was attentive to when our glasses were running low.I would rate my experience 3,5 stars, overall.I&#39;d love to come back and have the Vegetarian Thali (only available on weekends at lunch) and try other dishes (without pancakes this time!!).

Great food! My husband, his parents and I came here for lunch on a Saturday. We were seated immediately and were really looking fwd to some good food. We weren&#39;t disappointed. We ordered some vada pav, pani puri for appetizers. We also got their summer uthappam, onion rava, paper masala and corn/Panneer kofta with coconut curry. Everything was really good. They did mess up our order but fixed it when we questioned them. One server didn&#39;t acknowledge the mistake but another one quickly came by and said they would fix it. Another minor point is they were out of mango lassi!!! So one star removed for these two minor issues.

A friend of mine made a reservation for a girls&#39; night here and the ambiance definitely fit the bill! The decor and lighting make the place feel super upscale yet warm, somehow. Loved that!Onto the food - be forewarned that if you have a palate that is SLIGHTLY sensitive to spice, most of the items we ordered had a low heat that built up over the course of the meal. I personally love spicy, but I had 2 friends who wished they&#39;d been warned about the spice on the menu beforehand.The menu was a bit overwhelming so we followed the recommendations of our waiter.Would order again:-- Prawn Masala: The thick, flavorful yummy sauce! The prawns! Everything about this dish was just so good. A decent-sized portion, too - it came with 5 large prawns (yes.....I counted...)-- Chennai Chicken: I would describe this dish as flavorful chicken tenders served with a yogurt sauce and onions. Very shareable, good for a small group to split!-- Masala Dosa: Of course you have to order a dosa when you come to DOSA! This was my first time trying one, and I loved the concept of various dipping sauces.I was underwhelmed by the &#34;South Indian Moons&#34; (a sampler of uttapams) because they all kind of tasted the same. If I were to return, I&#39;d stick with the dosas, appetizers, and entrees!

So disappointed with my recent visit. This was my favorite south Indian place. The sambhar and red chutney were EXTREMELY SPICY! the waiter could not change it. The paneer dosa and masala dosa were okay. The idli was not too soft. Would prefer the Jay Bharat dosa over this now. Please bring back the less spicy versions! :(PS: NEVER order the panipuri here! By far the worst I have eaten.

We shared some great dosa, curry and uttapam at the restaurant. The atmosphere was nice, new, modern. The three of us sat at a high table as there were no regular tables available.South Indian moons uttapam was a good choice to try all the 5 types of uttapam.

The ambiance of this place is fantastic. The decor, the music, the entire atmosphere was great. We were seated quickly (had a reservation) and was greeted by our waiter. (1 stars)Our waiter was a little odd to say the least. He would always mumble and it took 35 minutes to get a glass of water.Let&#39;s move onto the food. The appetizers were good and had a great kick to it. We had the lamb sliders as well as a chicken dish (name escapes me). (1 star)The entree was where I and my date completely regret coming. The food was absolutely horrendous. We immediately asked for the bill and left to a different, but better Indian restaurant. The waiter concerned, asked why we asked for our check early. I completely being honest told him the food was horrible. There was no taste, extremely oily, and was cold. I have had dosas from other places, so I know how they are supposed to taste.We paid the entire bill (no need to comp the entrees) hoping they read this and hopefully experiment with better chefs. I really wish I could have a better experience here, but I WILL NEVER BE BACK. I&#39;m sorry, but I have lost all hope for this place.

The food was amazing. I went there with a friend. We had idli fries which was very unique - Fried idlis with tasty chutneys. I also ordered the chef&#39;s special uttapams. Was a bit disappointed with the serving, however, it was good to taste. Overall a good place and good food.

I love DOSA. Definitely one of the best Southern Indian food to eat at. It has a huge space and an upstairs too. They are known for their dosa&#39;s and their drinks. Also great wine selection too. Anything you order, you won&#39;t go wrong. Everything I&#39;ve tasted = DELICIOUS. The service is great too. I would recommend doing family style so you are able to try different dishes.

Our group split the bill between three cards and each one had an extra $2 added to the tip. When I discovered it was not only my card that was overcharged, I knew it was not a mistake and they had blatantly added more tip to the card.The food was delicious but this issue leaves a sour taste in my mouth.

Dosa on Fillmore is a very good restaurant if you are not experienced in South Indian food (or Indian food in general). Ingredients are fresh and tasty, ambience is nice, drinks are good. Service is spotty but not horrible, especially given how busy they are. But what makes a restaurant a good restaurant is at the end food and unfortunately what this restaurant does not deliver is... good South Indian food.If I was someone who has never had South Indian food, I&#39;d probably rate this restaurant higher, but as someone who knows this food, who knows good dosa, I was utterly disappointed. None of the dosa we ordered had proper spices, sambar tasted more like tomato paste than anything else, chutneys were all too mild and flavourless except the mint-coriander one.Considering how expensive the place is and the wait you&#39;ll have to get through, I&#39;d say it&#39;s not worth it. Sure, it looks good but looks is most of what it has.

This place is consistently good. I like to sit at the bar and have a dosa or similar plate and a glass of wine. I was bummed when they changed their menu (some years ago) to be less traditionally Indian, but it&#39;s still a great place to go for a drink and a bite -- especially before hitting a movie. Bar staff are friendly and I feel welcome.Went here recently with a group and had a delicious time. I recommend the mezzanine: it&#39;s quieter so you can talk.

Tasty and flavorful food can not make up for poor service! Save your money and go elsewhere!I used to come here periodically many years ago and had felt then that there was a service bias toward a certain clientele (read white affluent) that I was not a part of. I love the food and the Dosa&#39;s are amazing, but I had stayed away for years because I moved away and I never felt welcomed. I recently came back for a celebration dinner, give them another try, but was disappointed again.Here comes the rant:1) My party arrived shortly after opening and was seated promptly but no waiter or service staff greeted us until a good 10 minutes after being seated. There were around 5 seated tables at the time.2) There was not a single moment when a waiter nor service staff offered any of their complementary pappadum&#39;s. I had to ask for both plates and padapum&#39;s after our family style orders have arrived. I was annoyed that the tables next to us appeared to have been provided padapum&#39;s and plates promptly even though they were seated after my party AND was served by the same waiter. Those tables were asked frequently if they wanted refill padapum&#39;s. We got zero asks! This has happened before many times. If you don&#39;t want to offer them for free, charge for it! Don&#39;t eagerly offer it to some tables and not for others!3) FRUIT FLY&#39;s! Occasional fruit flies were flying here and there. One landed in a alcoholic drink. Yes, this is the Fillmore but come on, the door is not open right? How are you handling waste in the kitchen?4) Overall slow service from the start. Things seemed to flow a little better after I flagged someone down about the fruit fly, maybe they wanted to kick us out.I keep asking myself, why do I feel unwanted? Conscious bias? Unconscious bias? Is it because I don&#39;t look like I would tip well? The answer is that I could tip well if treated well. I was not treated well, so I tip poorly here.Goodbye Dosa! Never again!

So chic and sexy on the interior! Would be a good place for happy hour but we came for dinner. Get a few dosas to share, some rice dishes, apps, and you&#39;re set. Drinks look yummy, too, but as the responsible DD I went for the non-alcoholic South Indian Monsoon (ginger, citrus, mango). Very tasty.Every dish we ordered was delish (thanks to the Indian food expert in our group): Brussel Sprouts, Chennai Chicken, Chicken Koram, Sunchoke Kofta, Spicy Basil and Rava Masala Dosas, and a Bhatura. Plenty of food for 4 hungry adults to share. If you&#39;re wondering what to get, ask the helpful staff.

This place has literally been on my bucket list since I moved to SF 3.5 years ago. Even having visited South India, South Indian food is a bit foreign compared to the traditional North Indian curries that we are all used to. I decided to give this place a shot this past weekend for brunch.THE DRINKS: I tried one of their &#34;spice&#34; cocktails and my boyfriend had their version of a bloody mary. Neither of us were particularly happy with our drinks. I applaud Dosa for trying to do something different with their cocktails but they went too heavy on the spices. I should have just stuck with a normal mimosa. They don&#39;t offer any unlimited mimosa option which is disappointing.THE FOOD: We started with the idli sambar (veggie version) and poori. Both were excellent! The poori reminded me of a Mexico sopaipilla and I dipped it in the idli. Then we both got uttapams - my boyfriend an egg one and me a mushroom one. The bf felt that the uttampam masked the taste of the eggs a bit too much. I was a big fan of my mushroom one though - I&#39;m vegan and they were able to modify. Both came with an interesting mix of sauces.This place is also super vegan, vegetarian, and allergy friendly which is great.Prices are definitely a bit high but service is good and I would definitely come back. Portions are pretty big so I had leftovers to take home.Thanks Dosa for helping me branch out from my typical samosas, channa masala, etc. etc.

Service: 5/5 - very friendly staff, our waiter was always there to check up on us, and the food didn&#39;t take more than 15 minutes to prepare.Food: 2/5 - where it matters most dosa falls short. We got a veggie samosa, lamb sliders, and some paneer wrap (can&#39;t remember the name). None of the dishes were that great. The lamb was good but very greasy. The other 2 plates were kinda meh. The samosa was especially disappointing.Location/ambiance: 4/5 - lots of places to explore nearby. Dosa is right in the middle of Japan town + there are lots of stores and bars if you go up Fillmore. The ambiance is also great. Spacious, upscale, and very nice decor.Price: 3/5 - I don&#39;t mind how expensive a restaurant is if I feel like I got my money&#39;s worth. 3 small plates and 2 drinks ended up being around $90. Not super expensive but not cheap either. But for the quality of the food I don&#39;t think it&#39;s worth it.Summary: Dosa wasn&#39;t bad per se but with so many better Indian restaurants in the city I just can&#39;t justify ever coming back here again.

Contemporary indian cuisine; these three words pretty much sum up the restaurant.The high ceilings, open floor plan, modern design all make it a very fun &amp; vibrant place for one to enjoy an indian cuisine.Con; the food is pretty good but not outstandingly authentic to Indian cuisine.The drinks, not so creative, just your regular fancy restaurant type.Overall though it&#39;s a cool place to enjoy indian cuisine.

The food was great but the restaurant service was rude and pretentious. I really like this place and have been here many times. Very unique dishes and flavours. I could explore this menu for weeks and never get sick of it. Our waitress was helpful and very nice. I went with a group and we ordered half the menu and shared everything. My favorite was the lamb sliders, amazing! Now for the reasons I took off 3 stars; the rude and unacceptable behavior from a restaurant of this caliber and cost. My fiance set up a surprise birthday dinner for me and 8 friends. I had no idea until the receptionist spoiled the surprise. My fiance called ahead and made sure they knew it was a birthday dinner and supposed to be a surprise. The first thing the hostess says is &#34;tell me when your whole party is here.&#34; I corrected here it was a party of 2 which she said, &#34;no party of 8.&#34; My fiance&#39;s face dropped with disappointment and reminds the hostess that it was supposed to be a surprise. The hostess does not say sorry or even acknowledges that her mistake ruined the surprise. I can understand making a mistake like that, but to not even apologize or at least empathize, is unacceptable in the service industry and weird. Next big mistake, we had to wait close to 45 minutes for our table that we had a reservation for. Keep in mind this place makes you put down a credit card so they can charge you if you don&#39;t live up to your side of the deal for a rez. The hostess came by after half an hour and said, with no warmth what so ever, &#34;sorry about the wait I have notified the manager.&#34; At no point did the manager ever come over, and the extra long wait was never acknowledged again.They didn&#39;t even comp a desert or offer anything in retribution. I have worked in a restaurant before and have seen entire meals comped for less. This is even worse when I think about the how we would have been charged a fee is we missed our rez, yet they can completely drop the ball and barely even offer an apology. We had a great and very expensive dinner but it was overshadowed by the rude behavior upfront. I would recommend this place for the food but don&#39;t use it for a special occasion. Don&#39;t be fooled by the fancy decor or high prices, this place has no class!

Food was good, no doubt! - idli fries, chill garlic dosa and truffle dosa were the highlight of our order.Taking off one star as they seated our party of 8 on a table of 6 and even when we requested to be reseated there seem to be no action taken.

Since the name of the restaurant is Dosa, I&#39;ve expected authentic south Indian Dosas. South Indian dishes like Dosas, idlys and uttappams should always be eaten with chutneys(lots of chutney). Unfortunately the chutneys are very bland made with frozen coconut and also the quantity is very limited. I wouldn&#39;t recommend if you want authentic Indian food.

Probably the best Indian I have had. I took my mom who doesn&#39;t usually like Indian food and she loved it. Upon walking in at 2pm on a Sunday, it was full and mostly of Indians. I took that to be a good sign.The service was 5/5 - I had a lot of questions about the menu, and wanted one item on the menu that our server initially said was unavailable (all of the Thalis). However, when I showed disappointment (I like to try everything), he asked a server and they whipped one up for us. I was here with my mom, and we split the Corn &amp; Paneer Kofta Thali and the Lamb &#34;Keema&#34; Dosa. I did not love all of the Thali dishes, but that&#39;s just my tastebuds and I loved being able to try everything. A bit pricy, but the portion was huge and lasted me another meal and then some. This is a great way to get a variety of tastes and even comes with a dessert (rose custard - a bit overpowering on the rose). The dosa came with four dipping sauces - a cilantro-coconut, a tomato, sambar and the lamb. Perfectly spiced. The dosa was a little crispy and fun to break and eat. My two favorite items were the lamb and corn &amp; paneer which was in a thick coconut sauce. A little pricey, yes, but you are paying for good food.If we are being picky, I didn&#39;t love the interior of the restaurant, which seemed to be trying to be your average almost-high-end restaurant, and the tables were too close together, but I wouldn&#39;t dock any points because the food was stellar.

My guests and I arrived here promptly and were seated by the host. Having visited Dosa multiple times before I recommended this place to my husband as a must - try even for Indians. However, the service that night made me pledge never to come back there even though the food here is one of the best Indian fushion food in the city.Reason... our server was awful awful awful.... He was pushy and rude and just assumed that we were newbies to Dosa with no clue. I asked him about the difference between two ginger based cocktails and his response was all our cocktails are different with spices. Well.... that&#39;s not what I asked.secondly, we just started ordering appetizers and wasn&#39;t sure on the quantity so preferred to order less and then choose to order more if required and he was extremely pushy and said we needed to order more. Again, I had been to this place several times before and exactly knew their portion sizes so didn&#39;t appreciate his pushiness. Not to mention that we had to ask him thrice before we got poppadum in our table which my guests kid really wanted. I would imagine a restaurant of this caliber should provide special service to tables with children.We hadn&#39;t even had the appetizers served when the same server told us &#34;You better start ordering the entrees... We run out pretty fast&#34;. I mean really!!!! It was just 8.30 on a Friday night. I would imagine Dosa knows that weekend nights are busy and preps up accordingly.After dinner, we asked the kid if he wanted ice cream at Smittens and yes, he did. Douche Server just hears ice cream and immediately says in a rude fashion &#34;We don&#39;t serve ice cream here&#34; Well... we weren&#39;t really speaking to you.WIth this bad customer service after paying a bill of ~$400, I don&#39;t think I will be ever returning to Dosa.I would imagine that with these prices Dosa should definitely work on their customer service (stop kiss assing the affluent white clientele while serving Indian food) or else it will be a matter of time when no one will be returning for their food!!! People dine out to get pampered and be treated special. This was definitely not at Dosa!!!!

We live in the Mission and go to the Valencia Dosa often but last night we saw a film at the Kabuki and thought we would pop into this location. The menu is much more extensive. That being said I got a favorite - the paper dosa - but did try a chicken samosa. My husband got the paneer and pea dosa. I also had a fabulous cocktail - their twist on a gin and tonic that included tonic infused with fig and cardamom - wow.The best part was the exceptional service. We walked in and it was Friday night. One of the hosts kept his eye out on the bar (first come first serve) for us but we ended up at the community table. Our server was a delight. Gracious, caring and top notch. She was truly a gem. She was busy but still took time for a chat. Both she and the host were truly exceptional.

Ate here on a Monday night with my girlfriend and the place was packed, which clearly that says something about the quality of the food. My girlfriend is South Indian and so with pretty high standards to begin with, this place met all expectations and then some. We ordered the Paneer and Peas Dosa which was amazing. The quantity and presentation of the food itself is something to be spoken for. We also ordered the Lamb Keema dosa which was subpar but and may have been better if it wasn&#39;t served on the side of the paper dosa.Along with the main entree, we had three appetizers: the Chennai Chicken, Dahi Vada, and Idli Fries. All three tasted great, but we especially enjoyed the Idli Fries because of its unique texture and twist on typical finger food. We would definitely recommend this place again and say it&#39;s a must-visit for anyone looking for fusion Indian food.

For appetizers, we got the Chennai Chicken which is boneless natural, air-chilled chicken marinated in Straus organic yogurt, coriander &amp; cummin. That was delicious. For entrees, I got the Late Harvest Uttapam which was okay to good. But mt favorite was my friend which was Quinoa Thinnai which is Quinoa &amp; lentil batter with Thai chiles, ginger, fresh curry leaves and cilantro.

This is a type of restaurant, you would love to take someone on a date as well as family dinners. The vibe you get as soon as you walk in is I need to dress up! The ambience is so beautiful that you yourself want to dress up. For me the ambience won the heart because it is rare to see Indian restaurant with high ceilings and have double floors.Appetizer: idli and Sambhar- it was delicious. Sambhar had that spicy and sweet flavor. I honestly think it was the best south Indian sambhar I have had that had full on south Indian touch. Every other place, you can taste the flavor have the twist of either punjabi of gujarati to it as per the chef. Idli was moist and perfect. Chutney for me is what lacked flavor. For me it was blend. I would suggest to add little more spicy flavor to it.Entrees: We wanted Hyderabadi biryani but they ran out of it. Hyberabadi Lamb Chops, Karaikudi Chicken Korma and Habanero- Mango Dosa. Each of the dishes definitely hit the spot. Lamb chops were so tender and perfect. The potato vegetable was spicy and tangy. It went well with lemon rice. The chicken Korma was sweet and spicy and mixing with lemon rice burst mix of flavors in your mouth. Habanero mango Dosa was spicy and tangy. The potato filling was perfect.The restaurant is worth eating at. Service is good and very attentive.

Idli and Vada were good.Chana Bhatura-Chana was full of cinnamon spice and sweet.Nothing like a Punjabi Chana masala.I feel they change their recipe every time. Bhatura was very sweet(which is not meant to be)Vada Pao-This just assured me that I should not come back here!Vada was a mixture of sweet and spicy.(which wasnt authentic at all)Vada Pao is meant to be Spicy please!Those looking for Authentic Indian Sambhar of South India /Chana masala Bhatura of North India/ Vada pao of Maharashtra--- I would not recommend it.Those looking for Indian food with Californian blend--- Might try your luck ;-)AMBIANCE-Really good.SERVICE- Very good :) (A smiley only for the service)

Awesome food, great ambience but terrible service experience. Our cocktails and beer didn&#39;t show until after our dinner and we had to ask for it. The cocktail glass was dirty so we sent it back. They still ended up charging for it (although it was taken off when we called it out). They bought a wrong order to our table and never got our youngest daughter&#39;s food. The server was hardly around after the initial order. He mentioned desserts but decided to get the check instead of asking us if wanted any desserts after our entrees.We went to the place on our first family trip to SFO based on all the hype but were very disappointed by the experience. After we pointed our experience to the manager, we got the &#39;we are sorry&#39; response. Overall, a very &#39;sorry&#39; experience given the price point.

Food is good but not amazing. The price is pretty high, but may be because of its location. The service is not bad, but we had to sit pretty close to another couple, therefore had no privacy while talking and also had to shout out loud....Wasn&#39;t not an amazing experience.

YES YES YES!I cannot rave about DOSA enough!! I was so excited to check out DOSA for its fresh take on indian fare and beautiful interior. I made reservations via Opentable and we were seated in a relatively short time. They have an upstairs dining area as well. We were seated downstairs in the corner, which was great because we were actually able to have a conversation.We ordered the Hyderbadi lamb chops which were to die for!! As well as the truffle dosa. Both were delicious and met my expectations. DOSA is also known for its craft cocktails. I opted for a Spanish wine with my lamb, but my friend really enjoyed the ginger ante.I can&#39;t wait to come back!!

This review is a long time coming. I could have really given5 stars soon after my first visit to this place, but I opted to wait instead. Now that I have been here several times, it will do justice.Decor is really great with good (not great) music playing in the background.Service is fine too. The servers don&#39;t get individual tips here, but they share. Which is great, but that does give the same amount to a person who did not do well.Coming to food. They have great selection of cocktails which in my opinion are over priced. $12 dollars for drink is fine, but the amount should live up to the price that we pay. It really comes like just u get a tasting of the cocktail in those many dollars.Initially I was impressed with their food, but soon after I noticed that the goodness wasn&#39;t consistent. I ordered a veg kofta which was way too salty, and one of the days the sambhar was too thick. When they say they changed menu they simply change some ingredients here and there which is more seasonal. In my opinion Dosa on Valencia serves better dosas than this place. I would love to see a major spin on the menu that they have now.

We had one of the worst experiences at this place.the food was okay but what absolutely ruined the experience was the horrible service we had to endure. One of our party didn&#39;t get the entree they ordered even after reminding them twice. When we ordered coffee they dropped it off even though I specifically asked to hold it until after dinner. We got parathas and had to wait for accompanying entrees until the parathas turned cold. Then we got served with service charge on top of that and god knows what service they are talking about.

I&#39;ll be blunt: Sitting next to some one racially different, served by the same individual and served a bit differently made it a bitter experience. I may just be paranoid being new to SFO. The food is great, I had Masala dose, idli and sambhar! Not too expensive for SF. Conveniently located, there is a Safe way parking about 2 blocks away. I am hoping the staff can be more welcoming in the future!

Overpriced meal and meh service.Service: Waitress had no energy at all and spoke with a really soft voice. Didn&#39;t explain very well and just didn&#39;t seem to have a great demeanor. The guys who brought us the food had no idea who ordered what and several people at our table had forgotten what they ordered which caused some confusion, this happened a few times. There was one employee (manager or perhaps owner?) who was pretty nice and attentive.Food: had the &#39;tasting&#39; menu with the calamari app, paneer second course, and lamp chop entree ($48) and a shere khan cocktail ($12). Also with the meal was some spicy crackers and colored dipping sauces and some giant puff bread. Cocktail was the best thing I had honestly, it tasted great.The calamari came with a portion of calamari in a curry sauce, salad, and a piece of onion naan. Both the naan and the salad were pretty bland esp the salad but the calamari was pretty tasty although probably too spicy for most people.Panner course: paneer with peas wrapped with a crepe type bread. Comes with soup. I liked the soup, the paneer was all right but I wasn&#39;t much a fan of how it looked.Main course: lamb chop with potato and something else. This was the main disappointment, a single rib of lamb, hardly a good value at all. I ate it in two bites and was kind of a sad panda.Overall the food was pretty uninspired and quite expensive. I&#39;ll take cheaper indian food at Saffron Grill personally.

Extremely Extremely overpriced.The food here costs about 25 times more than it does in India and in my opinion is a over 25 times worse.When we (four of us) got there, the restaurant was fairly empty so we requested to be seated at a slightly larger table as we knew we would be ordering a bunch of food including dosas which would take up the place on the small table that they seated us. They refused to do so saying that both the empty 6 person tables had reservations beginning 20 minutes later. When we left 90 minutes later, no one had taken any of those seats and it was very obvious that they had lied in order to save the tables in the hope that larger groups might come in.I ordered a sada paper dosa for myself, and I specifically asked our server that it be made extra crisp, but when it came only about 40% of it was crisp and the rest of it was soft.We also got the kofta, which to me was not worth the the cost specially since they do not even include a bowl of rice with the $20 entree so it had to be purchased separately as did the chutney.Additionally, our server took his own sweet time to refill water glasses and only did so after being asked to (when I managed to flag him down).The only redeeming quality of this restaurant was that they seem to have kept the restroom clean.Overall, I just don&#39;t think that this place is worth as much as it charges and that they need to improve their service.

Truly a top-notch, eclectic fusion experience. Regardless of whether you are an anti-Chicken Tikka Masala kid who grew up on authentic Indian food, like me, or a complete stranger to the world of Indian masalas and &#34;bad with spicy food&#34; (some of the friends I came with), I would highly recommend this restaurant.Started off the night with the adorably-named &#39;Mango is the New Black&#39; drink. The combination of dry whiskey, spicy mango nectar, and spicy agave left a really burn sensation but was also the perfect amount of sweet. I would like to come back and try other drinks here for sure.For the main course, we ordered the South Indian Moons (combo uttapam plate), Spicy Basil Dosa, Goan Shrimp Curry, and Chicken Korma. The uttapams very small and cute, but there were about 9-10 pieces (great plate to share with people). The plate had a white truffle and mushroom uttapam -- didn&#39;t know this could be a thing!! The Spicy Basil Dosa was also SO delicious. The sauce was basically a traditional mint and cilantro chutney with an Italian pesto spin. It was spread all over the Dosa, not served on the side.The shrimp and chicken items were tasty but next time I will veer away from these traditional curries and try more of their fusion items - Chennai Chicken, Shredded Duck, etc.Come here with an open mind and empty stomach...and make it a mission to try as much as you can. I&#39;m sure you will leave feeling absolutely delighted (although your pocket will feel a little lighter... it is totally worth it!).

This was my first time at Dosa after hearing rave reviews about it from others. Unfortunately it did not live up to the hype, in my opinion.Pro: pleasant ambience, good portion sizes.Con: overly expensive, average food (my husbands lamb was too salty, my branzino was good but had too much of some sauce slathered over it), extremely slow service.Value for money, I don&#39;t think Dosa is worth it.

I&#39;m a huge fan of Dosa&#39;s flavors and gorgeous food. However, Dosa has a special &#34;allergy menu&#34; that&#39;s something of a problem. To me, being someone with food allergies (I&#39;m celiac with additional food allergies) an &#34;allergy menu&#34; implies that the wait and kitchen staff are conscientious about the needs of those of us with food allergies. If you have a gluten-free menu, that means the food has to be prepared and cooked separate from other food. I&#39;ve had many wonderful meals at Dosa and then been sick on my way home and for the rest of the night even though what I ordered supposedly didn&#39;t have anything I&#39;m allergic to. My guess is that food is getting cross-contaminated--most likely when it&#39;s being cooked.Dosa should either get rid of their allergy menu so that those of us with allergies know that the food isn&#39;t safe or they should commit to insuring their &#34;gluten-free&#34; menu is actually gluten free and not getting cross-contaminated. There are restaurants in SF that meet the needs of those of us with real food allergies without making us feel like we&#39;re being high maintenance or asking too much: Nopalito has tons of gluten-free items and (at least on Broderick) is super careful about cross contamination. Tacolicious will cook food in a separate pan (not on the regular grill) for those who react to cross-contamination. And Delfina and Al&#39;s Place are also great at dealing with allergies and and making diner&#39;s with allergies not feel like pariahs or assholes. I&#39;ve always wanted to believe that Dosa was in that camp but time and time again I&#39;ve ended up sick after a really expensive dinner.Oh, and their gluten-free dosa chips--at least at the Fillmore location (I&#39;m not 100% about Valencia) get cross-contaminated after a certain time in the evening. And their wait staff generally isn&#39;t aware that happens. In fact, my cousin&#39;s birthday dinner (she&#39;s also Celiac) was ruined because the wait staff didn&#39;t realize the dosa chips were cross contaminated and it took 10-15 minutes of me insisting that they ask the kitchen because I&#39;ve been through this many times with them--and guess, what? They were; after the wait staff repeatedly said they were gluten-free and she&#39;d had some! How confusing is that? Seriously, claiming your food is gluten free and then trying to save a couple dollars by cross-contaminating the cooking oil with gluten at a certain time is just about as lame as it gets.The message is if you have real food allergies, unfortunately, it&#39;s probably better to stay home and not be in pain.

Great food - I&#39;ve been here twice, both times with moderately large groups, so I&#39;ve had a chance to try many things. My favorite item is the scallops, which are super tender and flavorful. The samosas are good but fairly standard, unlike most items here which cannot be found or matched at most Indian restaurants. Last time we were seated upstairs on a hot day, and it was uncomfortably warm up there. They had opened the windows a bit, which they said was all they could do. The thermostat next to us said 82. Honestly they should have just closed their upstairs section that day, but we managed and again, the food was very good.

I was first introduced to the restaurant by the bf over a year ago. &amp; since then I have been back numerous times. I kid you not- THIS IS HIS FAVORITE RESTAURANT! We threw his surprise 30th birthday dinner here because that&#39;s how much he loves DOSA!I won&#39;t lie, the menu could be a little overwhelming for first timers. They give these complimentary bombbb crisps to start and they are so addictive! We&#39;ve tried a bunch of their dishes but their menu is quite large... we&#39;ve barely touched base on it.Some of my faves are:-duck tacos (it was too spicy for some of the lads so I had them all to myself lol)-Chennai chicken-Samosas-Prawn Masala-Sweet Potato &amp; White Truffle MasalaI want to go back to DOSA now after writing this review!!!

A gf and I stopped by in June of last year for Dine about town (DAT) but ended up ordering everything a la carte. I wanted to try a bunch of things so we decided maybe a la carte was the better choice. I love the standard chicken tikka masala, but I&#39;m not very versed in Indian cuisine. We discussed various dishes with our server and ended up ordering the following:-Chennai chicken ($11) - Yum! Crispy, moist and tender!-Dahi vada ($10) - I wasn&#39;t sure what to expect from this, but it was a nice contrast to heavier and spicier dishes. Cool and refreshing.-Lamb kofta ($15) - I love lamb! And in meatball form?! How could I say no!-Duck vindaloo with side of Lemon rice ($24) - I love duck! But since it&#39;s a fatty bird, I found the sauce a little too oily. The lemon rice went great with it though!-Uttapam: Mixed chile ($11) - So I ordered a dosa but ended up with a uttapam. If I had realized this at the restaurant, I probably would have said something. But I didn&#39;t find out until I got home. I did enjoy this though! Nice and spicy!Given that this restaurant is called Dosa, I really wanted to try a dosa! But since I&#39;m not super familiar with Indian food, I didn&#39;t know what we got wasn&#39;t what I ordered. I still enjoyed the dishes regardless. This just means the gotta come back for their namesake dish!

Spoiler alert: this review is specifically about their bar program (and not their food - which is awesome, btw).I came here yesterday for happy hour (available daily from 5pm - 7pm). My friend and I saddled up at the bar and ordered two Bengali Gimlets (Tanqueray gin, lime juice, curried nectar, and served up). This cocktail is pure awesomeness in a glass. It&#39;s about as perfectly balanced a drink as you&#39;re going to find. It&#39;s not only refreshing, but it totally captures the spirit (pun intended) of the restaurant&#39;s stylish Indian roots. One Bengali Gimlet goes down smooth. And after two Bengali Gimlets, you&#39;ll definitely be in a happy place and ready to chow down on some dosas and Chennai Chicken.While at $8 a pop, it isn&#39;t exactly the cheapest happy hour special in town. But they do offer a variety of affordable Indian bites to pair with your beverage (prices range from $4 - $8). Plus, it&#39;s hard to beat the sexy, electric vibe of Dosa. We arrived at 5:30pm and we were the only ones in the place. And within 30 minutes, the bar/restaurant was packed. Couples were dining; singles were flirting; drinks were being shaken; aromatic food was being savored; people were smiling. This is just an enjoyable setting for drinking and dining. Totally worth checking out.P.S. - great first date spot!

This place is one of the best places to dine in San Francisco. A must go for Indian food lovers. A few friends of mine had took me here earlier and I started liking this place right from then on. The Vada Pav here is just out of the world. Coming from India and having Vada Pav there in Mumbai and many other places, I can tell you that you could never get a tastier Vada Pav anywhere else. My wife and I also like the South Indian Moons - an assortment of Oothappams. The ambiance is very good and the service is of ver high quality too. If you are planning for dinner, I suggest you make a reservation early in the day or the day before. This place is slightly pricey but worth every buck!!

1* for service, 4* for food. Since I am weighing food more than the service for my dining experience, summing up with 3*.I did not have reservation, was told about 30 mins wait. They entered my info incorrectly in their system, I had to wait almost an hour. Food took another 40 mins to come after we placed order and check took 15 mins to come after request. Nonody cared about the time we wasted. All in all, we wasted more than 2 hours for a decent dosa and not-so-great dahi vada.Would only come back on weekdays with reservation.

The mushroom and truffle oil utthapam was pretty good too. The better part of the meal was the appetizers though. We got the vada pav and idli fries. The chutneys made both appetizers out of the world.They say you meet interesting people at interesting places. We had a nice light hearted conversation with out table neighbours who kindly bought us desert at the end. All in all a pretty good dinner date!

Oily food and Deceptive BillingHad visited dosa recently with couple of friends for lunch. We ordered a couple of dishes such as dosas - masala dosa and Rava dosa. All the items were very oily - there was oil all over the plate and on our hands after the meal. We have been to several South Indian restaurants and never had such an oily experience while ordering dosas.Also be careful about their billing practices - as for any group over with 4 or more people they will try to get DOUBLE TIP (20% SVC charge added on bill and on the credit card statement will have another column for gratutity). Actually the service charge is same as the gratuity but they are trying to deceive the customer by using different terms so they end up double tipping.

Upscale restaurant. We went during lunch hour but on weekend. You are in San Fransisco, so feel lucky if you get parking easily and close by. Most spots around are pay and park by meter.There was around 30-40 minutes of wait time. After we get a table, first thing we realize, yes ambiance is good but the place is too much crowded and waiters are steering through the narrow spaces between two tables. The food was ok - ok. Nothing special to mention about it as compared to price and quantity.Bottom line - Have had better &#39;dosa&#39; at other places than here...

Since one of my friends really wanted to have the chocolate-hazelnut dosa, we made it a point to visit Dosa in San Francisco. But we ended up at the wrong branch since that&#39;s available only at Dosa on Valencia.We&#39;d already had a tough time getting a parking spot on Fillmore so we stayed back to eat at this one instead.A few of us were apprehensive about eating here considering the Indo-Americanized food and it&#39;s steep prices but sat down nevertheless. Ordered vada pav, masala dosa, spicy basil masala dosa, spicy moong dosa and uttappam.Vada pav was delicious!Masala dosa was very tasty too. The potato curry and coconut chutney were top notch, whereas the sambar and tomato chutney were not.Uttappam was served in small portions which looked weird and apparently tasted odd too.Spicy basil masala dosa was not as spicy.Moong dosa was okay-ish.For dessert and later, we had rasmali and masala chai.The chai was pathetic - nowhere close to Indian chai.Rasmali was super creamy and delicious.Definitely worth coming back.

Keema Dosa and chennai chicken are the way to go.Just make reservations so you can have an overall pleasant night :)

It&#39;s a good place but maybe overrated, I bookmarked this place last year and never tried it so I finally booked a table for my husband&#39;s birthday. The place is beautiful, good atmosphere, drinks and food are tasty but not extraordinary...a little bit disappointing compared to what I had heard. Waitress was nice but not really helpful with the long list on the menu..

Amazing Indian food. Very authentic yet fancy. They even have small plates which are in between appetizers and an entree. It&#39;s a perfect amount of food if you like trying different things. This place gets very crowded. I recommend making a reservation. If you get there right when they open you might snag a seat at the bar. I&#39;ll be back!

Love love love the food at Dosa - but the service can be really uneven. Last night our waitress was terrible - oddly missing at various times in the evening and abrupt. They had plenty of staff - she wasn&#39;t bussing - she wasn&#39;t delivering food...it&#39;s unclear what she was doing. However it was at then loss of a bigger check and the house - we certainly would have had more drinks.That said, the food was wonderful. We had the chennai chicken, white truffle masala dosa, and the lamb chops. They&#39;re lucky the food is so good - otherwise we likely wouldn&#39;t hurry back. Perhaps next time we&#39;ll aim to sit at the bar...

Had the halibut last night. It was a special and so many delicious veggies and coconut rice. I get the rasam soup every time I go. Get it if you like spicy things. Rasam means fire broth.Tips-happy hour goes til 7!Get a reservation unless you don&#39;t mind waiting for a seat at the bar

Delicious - fell in love with the turmeric-gin cocktail, Flower Child. Food was delicious. Service was a little bonkers, granted our party arrived on a staggered schedule and the staff was accommodating in that regard. Left full and will surely be back for another feast! (And maybe we&#39;ll all arrive on time together next time.)

Dosa continues to spicily satisfy. As somewhat of a regular, I&#39;ve gone through my share of dosas and uttapams, and if you&#39;re new to the restaurant, that&#39;s where you really have to start.But otherwise... damn the namesake and try some of their other dishes, like the rather excellent peppercorn chicken I had at lunch the other day, or the coconut cilantro fish at dinner. Or go traditional on weekend brunch with their fine rendition of thali (really a great way to get sudden exposure to the varied flavors of South India).Whether I&#39;ve gone in the day or night, the place stays lively (almost bursting on Thur/Fri/Sat). It&#39;s super to see a now &#34;older&#34; restaurant keeping its charm and substance, but staying modern; a good sign that Dosa is going to be (if not already) a San Francisco institution.Locals note: I now live a block from this location so I&#39;m expecting to use the bar quite a bit, itself with its own sense of spice and flair!

Absolutely love it. Coming from a South Indian, it&#39;s a compliment when I say I love the dosas here.The dahi vada is really delicious and looks interesting.The drinks are good too.I like this location more because it&#39;s pretty big and spacious compared to the one on Valencia.

I&#39;m not too familiar with Indian food at all. I&#39;m not opposed to it (even after an ill fated try years ago), I just haven&#39;t sought it out. But with the crew heading here, I was happy to give it a try again.I love a good tasting menu, so I was happy to see one. Especially being unfamiliar with the food, it was nice to try a bit of everything. I ordered the chicories and Asian pear salad, the sweet potato dosa and the hyderabadi lamb.The salad was okay, but not mind blowing. Although I could have eaten a whole bowl of the fried goat cheese balls they had in it! The sweet potatoes dosa was good. I know that this dish is supposed to be a lot of dough and a little bit of the main &#34;stuffing&#34; but I wanted a little bit more potatoes!The lamb was awesome though! It was probably the right amount for a main dish, but it was so good I wanted more! And it came in this dish with a bunch of thick sauce. It just made me want more lamb! It was also so tender. I just love lamb, and they did this right!A fresh modern atmosphere and great service made it a fantastic evening to catch up with coworkers!

Dosa Dosa DosaThe restaurant is beautiful! So elegant with warm lights and inviting colors. You don&#39;t get bored looking around. Made a reservation about 40 minutes prior to getting there and was seated pretty quickly upon arrival.Started with the idli sambar small plates. The delicious bowl of sambar is super flavorful and the two idli&#39;s peek out at you, ready to be devoured. Warms you up and excites you for more food. I loved the &#34;thuriya&#34; green beans in there that pop into four you eat the insides of. Reminded me of the noms my mom used to make.I decided (after much contemplation) on the roasted chile and garlic masala dosa and boy was that a great choice. I love garlic, I love heat, and I love complex flavor. This dish had all of that. I nominate this star of the show.Other honorable mentions:Quinoa &#34;thinnai&#34; uttapamRaita(double- you will eat all of it) chutneysMasala dosaThe potatoes and cashews were on point, authentic, SPICY, and delicious.Towards the end of our meal, the guy taking our plates spilled chutney all overrrr one of the jackets on the chair. Manager was super nice and comped a dessert and promised to cover dry cleaning. Totally appreciated that.So awesome they have a menu that provides alternatives for dietary restrictions.It&#39;s not cheap, but it&#39;s worth it when you want a filling, quality meal you will be reminiscing about for hours.

In short: Good ambiance and good service, but overpriced for the decent food quality.We have been here only twice. The service has been good, specially on the most recent visit. The ambiance is a little too dark in some zones but still good. The food quality is decent but not on par with similarly priced restaurants in San Francisco.

This might be a misleading review as the 1 star rating is specifically for the Paratha (I would actually give it NO stars). I expected it to taste &#34;home made&#34; and authentic with the 3.50 price tag, instead it was the basically the Paratha you can get from any Indian/Arabic store and I think its like 2-3 bucks for a packet of 8-10. Really Dosa???? Don&#39;t get me wrong the other food I tried from here was really good but store bought flat breads? and that too it was over cooked. Ridiculous.The other food (chicken, potatoes etc) were really good.. but the overcooked and dry store bought flat bread killed the flavors really quickly. Skip the Paratha, get the Rice (or Naan if they have any).

Good Food , Good ambiance and Great Service!Tried the Vada pav. Loved it. Especially with the extra ghee(clarified butter) and gunpowder( spice mix) it comes along with. Tried the Duck appetizer. Very nice!! a little on the spicy side I must say.For mains we had the basil dosa and the prawn curry. Both were really nice. We got the paratha as a side (2 pcs/ portion).Overall I would definitely recommend it should you want to experience a fancier south Indian food faire... else there are other places around the bay where you can find similar food at a way cheaper price.

I&#39;ve been to Dosa every time I have visited SF. There are several reasons for this:- The food is always good- The food looks beautiful- The drinks are always goodThe most memorable dish here has been the White-Truffle-Oil masala dosa. I would have never thought that truffle oil goes so well with masala dosa. Also, their chutneys and sambhar have always been very good.The last time I visited we had the dahi bhalla and it was a masterpiece - both in terms of presentation and taste - so kudos!The cocktail menu is competent and the staff know their stuff.In the end, I would recommend Dosa in a heartbeat and visit again.

We live in Santa Cruz, and used to love going to Dosa when we&#39;d see shows at the Fillmore. Lat night we took some friends with us. The place has really gone downhill. The decor is still beautiful, but it stopped there. Used to be a killer sound system with great music, awesome service, and killer food and great drinks. Last night we had a 5:30 res. The place was empty, but they still gave us a crappy table upstairs (and we had our res for months). We objected, and managed a better table. I ordered a drink off of their drink menu and it came back only 2/3&#39;rds full (at $12!), and just not that cold or that good. My group all ordered chai, which was luke warm and bitter. then we ordered food. Nothing was bad.....and nothing wad that good either. The beet and cumin soup was basically an un-strained beet puree. Next up was the paneer and pea dosa, which really tasted more like cream cheese with no peas. Bland, rich, and not that much flavor, though the sauces were good (chili sambar, coconut chutney and a tamarind thing). Finally the lamb chop. It was cooked well, and basically as good as a lamb chop is.....but nothing more. Nothing special. All that.....and $80 a head, tax tip/out the door.It seems like maybe ownership has changed, and all of the things that made this place special were simply overlooked. This used to be my wife&#39;s favorite restaurant in the city...Now it just seems to be &#39;mutton dressed as lamb&#39;; An overpriced, gentrified Indian place. Bummer, because it was really special.

Being North Indian we always look for places serving good South Indian food. Also being part of wine country my love for wine pairing with food inspires me to go to places who have good selection of wine.Dosa has amazingly delicious south Indian food and excellent choice of wine and drinks. Food was surprisingly spicy enough to not kill the flavor but still make you feel the authenticity of typical South Indian food. Ambiance of the restaurant was cherry on the top!Prices were bit on the higher end given the quantity they serve but in San Fran its reasonable price. We will certainly go back again and try other dishes.

It was a south Indian Food Craving Night.But this place was an utter disappointment. It was a casual outdoor night and we made reservations for 8:30. We were right on time but it took their about 10 mins to get us seated. Reservations means you reserve a table.We got seated and we were served some papadum. We were quite confused as to who out server was.The waitress came to out table after 10 minutes.Food: We ordered, Sole fish, Dahi Vada, Idli Sambhar and Masala Dosa.The fish was good served with salad on the side. The Sambar was my favorite as the sweetness on Sambhar reminded me of the sambar you get in india,The Dahi Vada was a disappointment as the Vada was quite hard. I could tell the Vada was stale even though the presentation was quite good. The dosa was nice and crispy.Service: The service was the worst part of the restaurant. More than talking to the customers the staff was talking to each other. There were about 5 different waiters who came to our table. The staff was quite unfriendly. Service makes a big difference in the experience of the customer.Dosa&#39;s management really needs to work on training their staff.

Update from my post below: received a very considerate message from the owner. So I bumped up the rating one star for the nice follow up.Very good appetizers but food and drinks were overpriced. Though I rarely yelp, the staff were too stuffy and inattentive for me to let it go. Parched for 10 mins with an empty glass and no one nearby, I got up from the table looking for water. This got their attention so they hurried over to refill the waters. I was quite pleasant about it, but they were unapologetic and annoyed. Later, again my glass was empty and we had to call over to the hostess stand for our check. I ended up drinking the rest of my sister&#39;s water. I had been here a few years before and had a similar experience, minus the water situation.

Had much higher expectations for this place. Came on a Saturday night and the place was packed. The vibe they are going for is trendy but it felt a bit like they were trying to hard.The food was mediocre at best.We ordered the chicken samosa (decent) and the vegetarian samosa (meh). The chennai chicken lived up to the hype and I thought it was the one delicious item on the menu. I ordered the paneer and peas dosa and the lamb dosa. The dosa itself was fine but the paneer was incredibly bland, absolutely no flavor.The service was terrible. It was a busy night but our main waiter oscillated between forgetting about us and giving us the sense that he was rushing us out the door. The wait staff grabbed plates from our table that we were still eating out of.For the price, you can get much better Indian food elsewhere.

This is a great place for Indian food. We tried the Chennai Chicken, Dahi Vada, Rava Dosa, five moons uthappam and the quinoa uthappam. We had Steph Curry for the cocktail and some filter coffee.All the dishes and cocktail were probably among the best tasting ones in the Bay Area. The ambience is great and the staff is very friendly. They even charged my iPhone.The background music has an unique feel to it. There was some pop music mixed with Indian Bollywood tunes played at an optimal volume where you can still maintains dinner table conversation without having to shout over the music.

They serve raita if you find it spicy. Very friendly staff and though it&#39;s always full and they are busy, they constantly keep checking on you. My server even noticed my watery eyes while eating a hot dish and immediately got me more raita! Unlike other Indian restaurants it&#39;s very chic and has an amazing cocktail selection too. The Bengali Gimlet is a must try!

I really like this restaurant, and I feel as if in some ways, this location is more successful than the Mission location. First, the space is much larger. It&#39;s elegant without being overdone, and not fussy at all. Think high ceilings, large banquettes, and generous tables. The space is really quite beautiful.Next, the food is just excellent. I like the Mission location&#39;s food too, but there are more offerings here--super appetizers (samosas = yummy), generous dosas with tasty fillings, delicious curries, and elegant entrees. Their salads are good, too. I&#39;ve enjoyed several and have never been disappointed. I *love* the keema dosa, but the potato-based fillings are excellent, too. Even better, everything is so reasonably priced (between $12 and $15 per dosa or uttapam; it&#39;s between $20 and $32 for the entrees, which I&#39;ve never felt the need to order because the dosas are so darn good!).Each time I&#39;ve been, my servers have been friendly and knowledgeable. I&#39;ve also had some stellar drinks from the bar (an excellent sidecar and some very good wine). Add easy parking at the Kabuki to the mix (which is harder at their Valencia location despite that parking garage on 21st), and this is just a winning space. I will be back--many, many times.

I&#39;ve been here several times over the years and it never disappoints. It&#39;s my favorite Indian restaurant in the Bay Area by far. The primary reason is that they have very creative and tasty dishes. There is nothing wrong with Tikka Masala, Butter Chicken, and Tandoori Chicken, etc. However, they represent less than 1% of the wonderfully diverse cuisine of India. If you want to see what else India has to offer, go to Dosa. On our last visit we had Chennai Chicken (we generally order this every time) and Idli Fries. (Dahi Vada is another favorite). For mains we had the Spicy Basil Dosa and Tamil Lamb. The curry had just the right amount of heat, leaving a warm afterglow in one&#39;s mouth. I have a sweet tooth, but as much as I love Indian food, I have never been that keen on their desserts. Dosa is the only Indian restaurant that I bother to order dessert. They used to have a fantastic chai pot de creme, but alas, no more. They have a new pastry chef and the desserts we did have last week were very nice. Dosa also has some creative and tasty cocktails. I have always found the service to be attentive. On our last visit I mentioned that we had a time limit because we were going to the movies. The waiter did a great job of adjusting the timing accordingly. The ambience is classy, but not stuffy by any means. Finally, there is cheap underground parking available across the road in Japantown.

Wow...we are pretty disappointed. Food was decent but this might be some of the worst service we have ever had, especially at what is supposed to be a fine dining establishment. At $101 for lunch for 2 you would expect more than having to ask for a second drink, ask for the papadam, ask for the check and not even receive a thank you on our way out. We were bounced back and forth between servers and while we saw what looked to be the GM in a grey suit, he never stopped by to check in.Needless to say, we will never be back or recommend it to anyone.

This place had some good things going for it, and then some neutral things.Good:- Restaurant is very aesthetically appealing, in all ways- Great menu, everything looked really good and it was hard to narrow down- Papadum. yum.Neutral:- Dining companion and I ordered different dosas. His marsala dosa came out big and overflowing the plate, and my paneer dosa came small and tightly wrapped. Wish we had known this difference up front.- Paneer dosa seemed slightly dry and lacking in texture. Even when dipped in the sauces, it still seemed to miss some kind of structure or relief from the soft texture. It was good and tasty, just wished for some structure or crunch.- Side order of poori was average, small portion for priceMeh:-We ordered, and our food was out in 10 minutes. We had timed it with a movie at kabuki but then we had, 45 minutes to kill. Our reservation was at restaurant&#39;s opening time but we felt rushed by it coming out so quickly (though I didn&#39;t feel though that was the intention, waiter acknowledged its speedy arrival).Overall experience was good, mostly due to setting and ambiance.

Enjoyed a delectable lunch with awesome company, courtesy of my boyfriend =DDosa has been on my bookmarks for awhile now, and we finally got our butts over here to try it out. After checking the menu out online I figured it would be better to go for lunch (to spare our wallets a bit), and we didn&#39;t have to fight the crowds to get a table so it was win-win.We arrived when they opened at 11:30 and were seated immediately. The interior is very large and floridly decorated, but it&#39;s tasteful and interesting (definitely eye catching). The service is impeccable; our waiter was very nice, attentive and even answered my random questions when it came to identifying items of my thali.The BF ordered the Chennai Chicken as an appetizer, then the Prawn Frankie for his meal, while I ordered the vegetarian thali. First off: ORDER THE CHENNAI CHICKEN. This was the most perfectly cooked, tender chicken I have ever consumed, and it was coated in a combination of spices that enveloped your mouth in such a satisfying way. As if it couldn&#39;t get any better, they add a side of cucumber yogurt that you can dip your chicken it, which calms the spices and makes it even better!! That sauce was just as yummy as the chicken, and both my BF and I resorted to using a spoon to scrape the last remnants out of the cup ;)The prawn Frankie looks like a wrap but it&#39;s filled with delicious shrimp and it&#39;s quite filling. As for my thali, when I received it I freaked out a bit because it was so gigantic! There were at least 10 little individual cups on this tray bigger than my head, and in the center were rice, and two kinds of bread. I couldn&#39;t name everything I had if I tried but I remember there was saffron rice, basmati rice, cucumber yogurt, veggies, a pickled vegetable of some sort, lentils, a spicy soup, a rice puff with ghee (tasted cheesy to me), and veggie curry among other things. There was so much variety but I was able to taste so many things for a reasonable price. LEGIT.Overall this was a great dining experience. I would definitely come back, although the prices for dinner are a bit steep... then again they have a lot more entree options on the dinner menu so I bet it&#39;s worth it! Gotta come back and try the chai tea as well =)

Yum. I&#39;m a sucker for high-end Indian food. The decor is immaculate, and the food is great. The service is a little slow for such a high-end restaurant, which is the reason for knocking down a star. The spicy garlic dosa is (shock) SPICY. Make sure you eat it with the potatoes. I had to get a lassi (which was excellent) to help with the heat. The bhel puri was ridiculously good and beautifully presented.A little expensive, but well worth it

This place is incredible. The food is unbelievable, the drinks are excellent, and the service is friendly, fast and fantastic.I had the seasonal corn and paneer kofta with coconut rice. It was spiced perfectly. Honestly the best Indian dish I have ever had. My partner had a masala dosa (or something like that) and it was also very good. Mild, but delicious. We also had the calamari as an appetizer, which was excellent.For drinks, I had a tequila drink on the menu that was incredible. My partner, a huge gin fan, had the gin flight, which we&#39;ve never seen before. He loved the experience and the Oola gin was excellent.We also had dessert - I had a banana thing with passion fruit, and he had the mango lahsi. Also extremely good.Not the most specific review, but this place is incredible and we will definitely be back.I also want to be best friends with our waitress, Kate. She was awesome.

I love their selections!Definitely recommend anyone to try to this place. Dont know what to order? dont worry their staff with help you!

Beautiful restaurant and good service.Food is great but the soups are spicy. I&#39;d say the mildest soup is the corn one. It gets crowded and busy so make sure to Make a reservation.

Is this place overpriced, yes; there&#39;s no debate there. But that&#39;s the ONLY con. So if you can get past the price, stay tuned, because everything else is so damn good.Ambience? Great. Two stories, great service, romantic lighting at night, bright during the day/for brunch.Cocktails? Truly some of the best in the city, if you&#39;re looking for interesting flavors and new combinations. The Peony w/ coconut milk, gin, and fresh chilies is my go-to, and you can&#39;t really get anything similar elsewhere. Same goes for many of the other cocktails.Beer/Wine? List is huge, and includes hard cider and multiple sparkling wines by the glass.Food? Fantastic california-indian food, that&#39;s fresh, interesting, and well presented. You can get your basic masala and rice, or get adventurous and pick something you&#39;ve never had before; same goes for dosa. They also do a very relaxed brunch on the weekends, that has great dosa filled with scrambled eggs and indian spiced potatoes on the side.If you&#39;re a first-timer or a little worried about heat, I&#39;d get the panner &amp; pea dosa; even kids could have that. But if you want to branch out, do the tasting menu; it&#39;s totally worth it. The salad they had during the spring with fried goat-cheese balls, watermelon radishes, and curry vinaigrette was REALLY GOOD. The biryani are also great, as are any of the dosas. The uttapams are small, compared to everything else, but are a nice snack or small plate.If you&#39;re visiting SF, want a great night out, or want to take an adventure with food, this is totally the place. Use OpenTable to book a reservation online, as it&#39;s a busy place and the wait can be 45+ mins on a Fri or Sat night, without a reservation.

They promote themselves as South Indian food restaurant but there is nothing authentic about their food, neither their Dosas nor their Uttapams or their entrees. Dosa is basically street food in India that you get for very cheap; charging for the decor I suppose because the food is nowhere tasty unless people don&#39;t know what authentic South Indian food is like and love this place. We would still frequent this place very often due to the proximity of this location to where we live as we needed our dose of Indian food kick!A major drawback of eating at this place is the service. Every time me and family visit, the waiters do not let us order what we want and instead keep telling us &#34;You are ordering too much! You don&#39;t need to order this and that and blah blah....&#34; I mean, what&#39;s up with that??? Why can&#39;t we order what we want? Is ordering 2 appetizers and 2 entrees for 2 people too much? It seems for their staff it is (We are not a family of obese people mind you, if you think all we do is eat). They just wouldn&#39;t let us order appetizers telling us &#34;The entrees would be enough. Don&#39;t order appetizers it will be too much!&#34; We could box up the leftovers if its too much. We have never had a restaurant staff forcing us to not order what we want! And every time we ordered something else someone new would arrive to take the order. They keep switching the waiters.Low on kitchen staff? Then hire more people! Don&#39;t tell customers to order less. If this had happened once or twice I won&#39;t even mention it. We have frequented this place more than 15 times now and every time it has been the same - aggressive pushy attitude when it comes to ordering food. We know what we want and how much we want, we don&#39;t want the restaurant staff telling us not to order this or that. We have stopped eating here due to this and have no intention to go back! There are better South Indian restaurants in the city anyways so might as well drive farther away from home than put up with pushy service.

A friend chose this location for his birthday dinner. We were able to get a reservation at 6pm on Saturday night for a party of 8. Even though we arrived 15-20 mins. early, the staff was very welcoming and they were able to accommodate us. We were seated even before our entire party arrived.Dosas are delish here! I&#39;m used to eating sweet crepes for more of a dessert-like snack, but Dosa on Fillmore proved that I can happily enjoy a savory crepe for a dinner entree as well. This was my first time trying dosa of any type (I should really expand beyond curries and naan for Indian fare) and I was very pleased.{food}For a seasonal fall flavor, I say go with the PUMPKIN MASALA DOSA. The pumpkin masala with ginger and cinnamon created a really unique taste that you don&#39;t usually get with Indian food. Even my Indian friends were intrigued and impressed with my dish. I like how it came with an extra side of pumpkin chutney along with the sambar (lentil soup) and tomato and coconut chutneys. With the Bay Area weather turning a bit crisp and chilly outside, the spicy soup and warm dosa made for a very satisfying dinner. And the description of the portion as &#34;the size of a large plate&#34; is a bit of an understatement...I am pretty sure the dosa was the size of my face.The UTTAPAMS were also yummy and a couple of my friends chose the SOUTH INDIAN MOONS to get a selection of five different flavors to try. The texture was similar to potato latkes. I personally prefer the thinner, crepe-like consistency of the dosas.{drinks}All the SPICE ROUTE COCKTAILS are pretty tasty. They are on the smaller side but they pack a nice punch. I&#39;ve been in a tequila and spicy cocktail kick recently and went with the HIDEAWAY (the tequila, ginger, spiced agave, and birds eye chile caught my eye). I am still a fan of sweeter cocktails and also enjoyed my friend&#39;s MANGO IS THE NEW BLACK (rye whisky and spiced mango nectar made a great combo).{dessert}I loved the soft vermicelli noodles and beets swimming in condensed milk in the PAYASAM &amp; RED BEET HALAWA. It was a light dessert and reminded me of sweet dessert soups you find in Chinese restaurants. The RASMALAI was also a light dessert with cheese in a cream sauce flavored with spices and rose water. I preferred the sweeter flavor of the Payasam. Both desserts were quite large and we split them between our party of 8.Things to note:- You can take the 38 or 38L from Geary/Powell if you&#39;re downtown- If you&#39;re coming with 2-3 other ppl, I would take Uber or Lyft to save time and avoid the crowded buses- Close proximity to Japantown if you want some daytime activities before/after eatingI would definitely come back again if I&#39;m in the Japantown area!

Writing this review after giving it 3 tries. One of the most overhyped restaurants in San Francisco.Not authentic south Indian food. Food lacks flavor and spices. Have tried many dishes, even things like Dosa arent served with key chutneys. The masalas are nothing but mashed potato.

My rating is solely based on service and not on the food.The food was good. Most authentic Indian food I have had since I left india.Reason for 1 stars: a very sexist host that was rude, very rude and couldn&#39;t even apologise when realising he was completely wrong.We were a group of 12 people, 6 of us had opted in to taking the tasting menu. Everything was fine until we got to the third part of the tasting menu, waiters started placing what we ordered until it came to a kofta dish that no one claimed and one of the other 5 (who were all male) said he had ordered the chicken not the vegetarian dish. The host came and started telling me (only female person who had opted in for the tasting dish) that I must have taken the chicken by mistake. After telling him that I had ordered the chicken he insisted that I must have just forgotten that I ordered vegetarian and to exchange the dish. I had to tell him 5 times that I was sure I knew what I ordered. He then got the waiter with the order list to prove to me I was wrong just to realise that one of the men had forgotten what he had ordered. Not once did it occur to him to ask my male friends at the table if one of themMight have been wrong, not ONCE!This host could not even say, sorry for this to me after being rude and sexist in a way I have not seen in San Francisco so far. He managed to ruin this experience for me.So for men this is a great place to eat authentic Indian food, women stay clear unless you like basically being called a liar and incapable of remembering the simplest things!Very disappointed!

This is an upscale Indian place that specializes in Southern Indian cuisine (their own description). The ambience is nice and romantic. Well, but that was ruined because we were seated at a communal table, across from each other. On our right side, one guy and two women in their middle ages were talking about some serious mid-life crisis stuff (at some point, they talked about an ex-wife who did voodoo right in front of her son). On our left side, a couple was dining and talking about some classy movie stars like Keanu Reeves. It was amusing to umm not intentionally overhear everything they were saying, but it definitely did not make a great date spot (the communal table, that is).They offered a $42 three-course meal that can be shared between two people, and my boyfriend and I took the deal after making very quick calculations.It was definitely enough food for two. We ended up getting:1st course: Seafood vada - not recommended. This was more like a seafood pancake that doesn&#39;t really taste like seafood. They could have told me it was a potato pancake and I would not have known the difference. Get something else!2nd course: Dosas with lamb (+ we got masala on the side). Meh. Dosa tasted like a not as tasty version of Ethiopian sour dough rolls. They provided two types of chutney with dosas, but that wasn&#39;t flavored strongly enough to complement the sour taste of dosa. The lamb was okay, and the masala was okay. But I didn&#39;t think anything was great or amazing. Also, they only gave us one roll of dosa and we thought given the price, we would have liked one more.3rd course: Chicken Xacut. This was actually pretty good. It was spicy (pretty spicy), red Indian curry with chicken in it served with rice.All in all, I thought it was a good one-time experience. But I would not seek this place out again, especially at their price.

This is a difficult one for me to rate as I could only eat (less than 10%) of the menu which did not have nuts / coconut ingredients. I was impressed that they had a menu for those with allergies which clearly showed what is suitable. It would be great if they added coconut to this. From what I did eat the Uttapam selection was bland. The boti kebabs were excellent and the samosas were ok. The cocktails were very good. The price was too high for the quality.

Okay, first things first... giving credit where credit is due... the food was amazing. Every single dish was delicious, aesthetically pleasing, and served hot. From a flavors/textures/yum factor, this place is WAY up there.But the service... God... the service...Now understandably, it was a challenging day. There was a Ramen Festival about 10 feet away from their front door and as a result, the street was closed off, there were people outside everywhere. We get that. Also, because of said event, traffic was nightmarish. It cost me almost $20 in an Uber to go 1.8 miles to Dosa today, a drive that would normally be about five bucks. And we hopped out and walked the last block, because that last block would have taken us another ten minutes in the car. Fair enough.But our party of eleven trickled in as best we could under said circumstances, as people were helplessly stuck in gridlock and/or desperately seeking parking. Like everyone else at the restaurant, we were doing the best we could to get there and get seated.And the restaurant just wouldn&#39;t quit bugging us about when our party would arrive. Now, we had 8 people there out of a party of eleven. Food was being ordered. Cocktails were being ordered. We weren&#39;t only NOT squatting, but we were still a large party ordering a lot of food and spending a lot of cash.But part of the reason lunch took so long, and actually the part more responsible for the delay than our transportation issues, was that EVERY time we wanted to order more of something, or someone new arrived and had to order, it took FOREVER. Half of our orders had to be placed again, 15 minutes later, on three separate occasions because someone on the staff dropped the ball. Reminders were not handled gracefully. Coffee was never refilled, until the third time asking. A few times we (very politely) asked the staff to take new orders, were told to wait, and never returned to.Delicious food, good location, reasonable prices, and beautiful aesthetic. But why didn&#39;t anyone bother to train the waitstaff to wait tables?

Place and ambience is really good. The waiter was great and so was rest of the staff. I just did not find the food very creative. The DOSA&#39;s were just ok . This is a great place if you want to consume south Indian cusine in upscale setting without fixating on pure taste. Drinks etc were fine and par for the course for an upscale resturant.Chef can let the creative juices flow and throw in some creative DOSA combos which would make this place really great.

Dosa has got to be one of the most overhyped restaurants in San Francisco. Came here with my family based on glowing reviews from fellow yelpers, however we were all very let down.We ordered the vada pav and a chicken kabob dish to start out with. They were both good, but the chicken kabob platter came on a huge sizzler dish with only two small pieces of chicken and a bunch of vegetables... Thanks, that&#39;ll satisfy the five of us! For entrees we had the lamb keema dosa, white truffle dosa, sada dosa, and some prawn dish. My brother in-laws prawn dish was good, while everything else was just plain &#34;blah&#34;. The name of the restaurant is &#34;Dosa&#34;, yet the Dosa&#39;s were flat out mediocre.My family &amp; I agreed that the only plus to Dosa were the drinks. The &#34;Wry Rajah&#34; and &#34;Mango Is the New Black&#34; were excellent and I&#39;ll show some love by saying they were definitely a good creation on their part.To sum it up, $300 later and I was still hungry when leaving the restaurant. If you like dumbed-down South Indian food then feel free to go to Dosa. I think it&#39;s safe to say I won&#39;t be going to Dosa to have dinner again, however If I were to come back, I&#39;d hit the bar and go somewhere else to get great food at half the price.

This man has not only good morals but also values his customers as if they were his.Owners, give this man a raise or promote him if you want your business to blossom. Not only that he is loyal, he is also very-very hard working and always smiles and says please and thank you.

It has been a while since my visit to Dosa On Fillmore in early March, but I didn&#39;t want to skip a review for the place since it was one of my favorite dinners during my last San Francisco trip. Definitely worth a revisit next time I&#39;m in town.Dosa does upscale Indian right. The food is great, the environment classy, drinks excellent, and yet you don&#39;t feel completely robbed after paying the check. In my opinion, you can&#39;t go wrong with the tasting menu, a three course meal for $35. Add on the wine pairing for just $18 more and you will be served pours that are practically full-size and perfectly complementary to your courses.I&#39;m a little hazy on the details of each dish I had but I know the samosa I started with blew away the samosa I had during my lunch at another restaurant earlier in the day. The second course is a choice between some uttapam and dosa variations; I had never tried either before but the the dosa I ended up ordering was absolutely delicious. The lentil dipping soup served alongside was the perfect accompaniment. The whole thing reminded me of an Indian version of an American favorite: grilled cheese and tomato soup. My third course was some sort of spicy boneless chicken which was also very nice.Just thinking about this dinner makes me smile because I was also in great company. What&#39;s better than sharing an awesome meal with awesome people?

The food was a 3.5-4. Very good, unique, and reasonably priced. Didn&#39;t necessarily blow your hair back but very solid. Also we ordered mostly vegetarian shared dishes (was on a date) which aren&#39;t my normal favorites so I might change my view when I come back and order more meat / seafood dishes. The one seafood dish we did order, the scallops, were awesome. The dosa was good for what it was but not my cup of tea. Date loved the watermelon salad, I thought it was good not great, same with a yogurt dish that we ordered.4 on cocktails. Order the whiskey based cocktail second down on the list. Forget the name but it is well made and unique, made with cool spices.4 for ambience (again taking reasonable prices in mind) it was trendy and fun - not &#34;wow&#34; level but cool.Solid 5 on service. Best / most attentive service I&#39;ve ever received at a restaurant in this price range. Our server knew every ingredient in every dish on the menu and made good recommendations on pairings and courses, brought over things to try, checked in frequently, didn&#39;t rush us at all, was very friendly and into the food. Wish I knew her name so I could call her out, she was really good.

This is really, really solid Indian food. The dosas aren&#39;t even my favorite. Had a great brunch thali on the weekend for a good price. Amazing flavors and spices that really stand out and don&#39;t just blend together and taste the same. The curries are overpriced but honestly, very good.

While the food and drink at Dosa are amazing, these five stars really belong to our server. I can only imagine waiting on our table of many-a-loudmouth to be a bit like herding cats, so my hat is off to you, bespectacled gent with great taste in cocktails. Sadly, I forget your name. Happily, I have not forgotten anything about the food.We all opted for the three-course tasting menu, so I was able to pinch off of my neighbors plates to get a better sampling. It all started with a fabulous Chicory and Pear Salad: so fresh, so bright, so thoughtfully put together and then dressed with the single most delicious cilantro dressing I&#39;ve ever had. I also nipped a bit of the shredded duck which was rich and decadent and totally special. However, my next course was the absolute stand-out: Winter Uttapam with caramelized fennel, sun-dried tomatoes and a smattering of root veg. The star was the actual pancake -- dense without being doughy and subtly flavorful.Where I ran into a bit of trouble was course #3, the Chicken Xacuti. Now, I like spice. I like spice this side of hot. I can throw back, seriously. This, however, was the kind of snot-inducing, drool-triggering, heartburn-churning heat that my wee Scottish stomach is just not built for. I silently suffered until I saw my colleagues around the table fanning the flames, as well. However, if you are a scoville scholar and enthusiast, this is the dish for you.Another component worthy of noting: the drinks! I stuck with my favorite, a bourbon Old Fashioned but several of my fellows wadded into the creative cocktail pool and all were delicious and refreshing. They&#39;re quite unique, so this is where your server will come in handy -- just ask and (if you&#39;re as lucky as we were) you&#39;ll be perfectly paired with a terrific tipple.

Everything was DELICIOUS. Chef did not hold back on the spices...and that doesn&#39;t mean just making it &#34;hot&#34;, just very flavorful. The dosas were awesome. Our party ordered the paper dosa &amp; spicy basil dosa. Never tried a basil dosa before, and loved it. Also, someone ordered these little Indian veggie sliders (LOL, I&#39;m sure it has a name), and it was yummy. When I asked my friend what it was, all I got was &#34;indian street food&#34;. If that&#39;s Indian street food, then please let me roam the Indian streets for more of that!But, check your bill. They added tip to our table of 5, which is not customary at other restaurants. So we ended up double tipping.

The dishes we had at Dosa were innovative and beautifully presented. The coconut corn soup had delicious, subtle flavors, and the sweet potato dosa was an awesome twist on a classic. The flavor and spicing of the sambar and coconut chutney were spot on.The atmosphere and service were also great. We were seated immediately at the communal table at 6PM on a Saturday, although the restaurant quickly filled up by 6:30PM. The service was lightning quick.

I found Fillmore to be a little expensive than Valencia, it is also upscale and bigger and has a more trendy vibe to it as compared to Valencia. Perfect for a group to hang out by the bar and enjoy some delicious cocktails before grabbing dinner. The drinks here are very good. I would go to Valencia on a night when I just truly want to hog, get in and get out quickly, probably also when I&#39;m not dressed too well: pI have had a few dishes at both the locations and honestly they were pretty consistent in taste and quality. Fillmore has things on the menu that Valencia does not and vice versa. Reservations are recommended at both since it can get very busy especially for dinner and over the weekends.Dosa on Fillmore - I made reservations for four for a weekend and when we went here, of course, it was packed! We arrived about half an hour earlier than our reservations and had to wait at the bar since they did not have anything available sooner, which we pretty much knew. We grabbed a few cocktails and were seated upstairs.Our server was very nice and accommodating. Our order came at a lightning speed, I think they brought our appetizers almost immediately! We must have ordered about seven people&#39;s worth of food among the four of us and we managed to finish every morsel of it! I am very surprised at how great the food is here. There are very few places who nail both South and North Indian dishes and Dosa does a pretty good job at both types of cuisines. Masala/Plain dosa and vada paav are must try&#39;s!

Yet again, Dosa has impressed me with their customer service. I placed an order for pickup by phone; when I arrived I realized I had made an error with the order. The manager revised my order with no problem and my food was ready quickly. When I got home, I saw that one of the items I&#39;d paid for was missing. I called and the dish was delivered to my home promptly. Thank you, Dosa!

The food was very good and service was great. Our food came out quickly. They even have a separate menu if you&#39;re vegan or have a dairy allergy. The white truffle dosa was tasty- light on the truffle though. The mung salad was good too.

Ok, the most authentic Indian dosa that I have ever had in the States, is here. I had the Lamb Keema dosa, with some extra Parathas. Friends had Masala dosa and chilli garlic dosa, we did order a plate of bhel puri, pani puri and Kale pakoras. The best appetizer in a really really long time is Kale Pakoras - light crunchy and fresh - A MUST TRY here. It was a little expensive overall, but I guess you can&#39;t help that in a city. We spent almost $30 a head. But, worth it in my opinion.Tip: Make sure you make a reservation if you need a table of 5 or more.

Don&#39;t go here with a group. Repeat -- NOT GOOD FOR GROUPS.So, my issues with Dosa run deep -- I&#39;ve never thought this to be one of the better South Indian (or Indian, period) restaurants in the city, and Saturday night sealed the deal.Our party of 12 (big, I know, but we&#39;d made a reservation weeks before) was told it would be another 25-30 minutes for our table despite all showing up on time. Boyfriend and I headed to the bar where we got two totally subpar old fashions that, with tip, cost $37. Oh right... I forgot how overpriced this place is. Did I mention subpar? There was nothing special about this drink. If anything, it was watered-down and did not help for the dinner that was about to take place.Headed upstairs for our table, and it seems our waiter was either stoned or slow, but he definitely wasn&#39;t all there. Ordering (one person handled all of it... family style... super easy...) took an amusingly long time. It stopped being amusing when only two of our dishes showed up and no more. Aaaand our waiter disappeared. Aaaand another waiter introduced himself. Aaaand they had no record of the rest of our order. Aaand suddenly the original waiter appeared and could barely remember anything. &#34;Remember when you asked us which variety of rice we wanted? You never brought it... Remember when you suggested the Chennai chicken? Yeah, that never came...&#34;A lot of inaction pursued--it was odd, really. And then the manager came out just to check on us. We explained that it seemed our order was &#34;dropped&#34; and he became very flustered. Saying he was sorry (the right thing to do) but overemphasizing that this had never happened before (yeah, to us either), and that he needed to figure out where the ball had been dropped (not our problem, just fix it).I was super duper unimpressed with the manager, who, as a manager, needs to manage, even if it&#39;s a situation that he&#39;s never seen before. That&#39;s why they pay you the big bucks, right?We had to reorder. They comped the rest of the dishes and threw in some dessert. But I didn&#39;t love how they were acting like the heroes for making something right that they had so thoroughly screwed up. At least I got out of there paying what the meal was worth rather than the hundreds extra on meh food had it all come out on time. Silver lining, I guess.Dosa, I&#39;m done w/ you.

You have Diwali special great( and no I don&#39;t check restaurants fb page to see if any special event going on before dinner.. ) . But when called for reservation please be courteous enough to tell them what&#39;s going on before they reach to have dinner . Such a disappointment from staff and who should tell staff how to handle calls.

Bottom line at the top: 3 stars for food, rounded up to 4 for impeccable service.--Came here with a(n Indian) friend who has been convincing me to try this place for so long.After an exhausting day of shopping in the city I had no willpower to read through the incredibly long menu. So we went with the pre-fixe that had three options for each course (no dessert).We had (the menu online isn&#39;t current so i can&#39;t really remember the last two dishes):chennai chicken, lamb kofta, broccolini dosa, spinach fennel and mustard greens dosa, another type of lamb, and cranberry chicken.the chennai kofta was soo good but pretty spicy (at least to me, my spice tolerance is pretty low). this would turn out to be a recurring theme for the night so if you don&#39;t have a high spice tolerance i would maybe reconsider your options haha. the lamb kofta was way too spicy for me and also had a little bit of a weird texture.i did not like the second course at all. there was a sauce that came with each dosa/uttapam that really did not sit with me. and the fillings inside both were kinda weird. i would recommend asking if you can get them to be served plain, with no sauce or fillings. they would be much better this way.we were so absolutely full at this point so we took the last course to go. it was just okay. so overall i probably wouldn&#39;t recommend the pre-fixe.i can&#39;t remember out waitresses name unfortunately but she was absolutely fantastic. she was very helpful in explaining stuff to me and definitely slowed down the pace for us since we were talking so much not really eating. the bus boys were very funny, polite, and attentative. they noticed that i&#39;m a spice whimp so they were constantly coming by to offer more water.the bar area was also super nice and it would definitely be cool to come by during happy hour. this place was absolutely packed on a monday night too!

This is such an amazing place. We ran into this place by accident, when we were hungry. We just walked in (apparently, this place is so busy. We just got lucky that day). It was Cherry Blossom festival as well so the place was super crowded. We ate Truffle dosa (chef&#39;s advice), Kesar dosa and Thali. All tastes really yummy. I strongly recommend this place.The only reason i gave 4 stars is because they did not want to take a reservation for 14 people, when i want to take my friends on a weekend. I think considering how big the place is, and how good the food tastes, they can really take big group reservations. Not sure, why did they turn down that day. But with a small group, any time and any day i will go. No regrets!!

I love Dosa&#39;s food. I really really really do. This review is not to judge their food AT all. Their dosas, appetizers, and drinks are all delicious. Indians are very picky on our own cuisine but we do love coming here.This review is only for my one encounter last night at Dosa. My now husband and I wanted to take our families out after our civil marriage ceremony at City Hall. I made a reservation 2 weeks prior for a group of 14. I knew we would end up having a little bit more people so I called the restaurant a few days later. They happily bumped up my order to a table of 16. They offered if we wanted to have a group dining menu and I declined. I was about to get married, I don&#39;t want to pick what other people would have for dinner. I thought everything was set.I got a call driving to City Hall from a very sweet lady saying that her chef/mangers were asking to change our dining to a tasting menu to better accommodate our large group. I again declined claiming I know my family, I know how they are, they won&#39;t be happy with a tasting menu AND if I would have known this, I would have booked something else. She put me on hold and said, don&#39;t worry about it, we will see you when you get here. As we get to the bar, my father and friends are ordering some drink. A manager came up to us and told us maybe we shouldn&#39;t order because &#34;we have a minimum for the space upstairs and we won&#39;t meet the minimum if order drinks here&#34;. I again told him we were never told about a minimum, are ordering off the regular menu, and was a little frustrated that we were discussing this AGAIN. We went back and forth for a little bit until he realized he was confused on which party we were then let it go.It was not terribly inconvenient or maybe I was just so high of endorphins I really didn&#39;t care much but it did put a little damper in our happy day. Regardless, our entire family was happy, everyone left full, and we had a great time. I think they could work on their group/larger dining experience and work on their clear communication.

Environment: Fun and hip.Drinks: Delicious...expensive but delicious.Food: SO SPICY. Honestly, I don&#39;t have a high spice tolerance but my boyfriend does and even he had to stop eating his food. We honestly didn&#39;t even want to pack it to bring it home because it was too spicy.Also, and this is my lack of cultural awareness, I didn&#39;t realize that South Indian food does not have naan. :( Sad day.Service: Great. Super friendly. But it always kind of sucks when the waiter&#39;s switch in the middle of the dinner and you get the feeling that they are telling you to pay now so you can tip them. #awkward

I don&#39;t live in the bay area or SFO and the moment I told my friends that I need a good suggestion to eat hearty Indian food, a lot of people suggested Dosa on Filmore (considering that there are dime a dozen Indian restaurants). So, I was curious and went to Dosa for dinner. I had fried idly for appetizer and Rava Onion Dosa for my main course. One word to sum it up all - &#34;Brilliant&#34;. Their sambhar was the best sambhar I have ever had in my life. I would definitely recommend going to Dosa (even if its a bit of a drive on 101 if you live in the east bay). I gave 4 stars because there was a wedding reception? happening on the day I visited and the waiters were all over the place and the orders were a bit delayed. But otherwise lovely ambiance. Will definitely be back!

Disclaimer: I have yet to visit this place in person, BUT I did try the leftovers that my sister brought back. It was too late in the night to eat the dosa she got back, but I tried the sambar that came with the dosa.It was BAHM!I&#39;ve had many dosas/sambars before, and they were good, but they were spiced to the point that you knew this stuff is Indian /South Asian, and then went kind of flat, kind of like a good dal with lots of veggies.Then there&#39;s this stuff, which with the heat went up several levels. This stuff was gooood! It was very spicy indeed, and I enjoyed it very much. My ears felt the heat, got a little thickly, and steamed came out and the itch and all went away. I would end up eating the whole sambar , by itself. Watch for the chili though. I bit into it in the dim light and that was not pleasant. Have yet to have another sambar that pleasures me this much. (I can&#39;t say anything about authenticity, but it was delicious.)Word of warning: if you can&#39;t eat spicy, best to move on. South Indian food is notoriously spicy and makes the typical* Indo/Pakistani food look like child&#39;s play. My sister couldn&#39;t eat the food here and had to return a dish. They were kind and understanding and gave my sister a cream pop ( she didn&#39;t say if it was kulfi or not).*Typical in the sense that it&#39;s what lots of people think of first when it comes to South Asian food, gravy with wheat bread and basmati rice and much more represented in the bay area.

This place is the bomb. Food is delicious and unique. Interior is stylish and so are the other diners. Servers are friendly, knowledgeable, and not at all snobby. We started off at the bar (where I got a very generous pour of bubbly rose), and ended at a table, hours later. Waits can be long, but once we ordered, the food came in reasonable time. We visited on a Sunday, and snagged a free street parking spot just a block away (on Geary).

Had a dosa and world class service when I wandered in here after a spa day and kept dreaming of coming back.. I did it was busy I had to go to the bar to even buy a drink, not enough wait staff set in a crowded seat and not attended to.. Ordered the prix fixe menu but the worst part wasn&#39;t the taste it was an Ok meal. I afterward along with my family member felt like I had an inflammatory response to the food, as in MSG or some type of chemical reaction like I was very swollen feeling.. So if you go just order a Dosa not sure what else is safe if your a food sensitive person.

I love Indian food, but I guess I never knew that it could be taken to such an elegant place! First off, the space is gorgeous, with romantic lighting and soaring ceilings. They serve delicious wine at the bar or with your meal, and even offer a wine pairing menu if you so desire.My friends and I came in unfamiliar with a lot of the menu but were told we absolutely had to try a dosa (duh). We went with the white truffle variety because, really, when something comes with white truffle, how do you say no? I liked it a lot - the texture was perfect, but I found it a tad salty.The highlight of the meal was the lamb dish, recommended by our super informative and friendly server. It was cooked absolutely perfectly! We also had a vegetable side that I can&#39;t seem to find on the menu now - it may have been a seasonal item, which featured brussels sprouts and was kind of forgettable.I was truly impressed by the lamb dish as well as the beautiful ambiance and attentive service. I will absolutely come back here again... I&#39;m just waiting for the next opportunity!

They were busy when I visited, despite being a Tuesday night.The ambiance and service were excellent.This is not a traditional Southern Indian Restaurant, the interior is modern and the menu inventive.Ordered the following:Poori Bread - ExcellentChutney Sampler - Good but would prefer more interesting flavors - It paired very well with the Poori thoughBhel Puri - ExcellentLamb Kofta (Meatballs) - ExcellentPrawn Masala with a side of Coconut Rice - ExcellentTruffle Oil Dosa - Unusual flavor for Southern Indian Food but ExcellentChicken Biryani - The only dish I did not like. Biryani should be in the comfort food category - for me the topping was too heavily spiced for this type of dish and I love spicy food.Pear Tart Thing - ExcellentChocolate Chilli Mouse - Was not quite what I expected - it is more cake-like with a small amount of mouse on top. It was Ok, but I preferred the Pear Tart.Overall a very pleasant dinner. Could have been 5 stars if not for the over-spiced Biriyani.

Okay seriously, this place on the corner of Fillmore and Post has been calling my name for like over a year now and I&#39;ve never gone in.....(as an Indian food lover, shame on me I know)Finally came for lunch on a weekend and was REALLY impressed! Was able to be seated instantly at the bar area.The interior is wonderful, bright lights, marble floors and a nice bar area for ordering drinks AND food.The Indian food here is unique because it&#39;s not your typical curries and stews you would find at most Indian food places around. Here they serve Dosas and Uttapams which are like basically Indian savory crepes!It was my first time eating it and I was sooo happy! Yum yum. We also got the Chennai Chicken (which is like an Indian version of Chinese popcorn chicken) and a Mango Lassi! Seriously, it was the CLASSIEST mango lassi I&#39;ve ever had.....hands down.Seriously, come here for classy Indian lunch/dinner that&#39;s out of your ordinary curries! You seriously won&#39;t be disappointed because the food is BOMB and reasonably priced! (For SF that is hahahaha)

I&#39;ve been to Dosa many times - and it&#39;s always solid - but tonight I had one of the finest fish dishes I&#39;ve ever had.The Branzino in Banana Leaf was just sublime. Baked, but melts in your mouth. Subtle mint Thai chile flavor - chutney, ginger, curry and eggplant all come together in a phenomenal way. Highly recommend this dish.

Came here recently with a very large party, and we were not disappointed. We&#39;re newbies to this kind of cuisine, so shout out to the wait staff - our waiter gave excellent descriptions of everything (his drink descriptions were outrageous and funny...and spot on) and was key in helping us choose the right dishes. Everything we ate was delicious and I would order again. The drinks are also fantastic - each is unique so I would pick your waiter&#39;s brain about what you&#39;re in the mood for.Only reason it gets 4 starts and not 5 is that it was really hard to get in. We&#39;ve tried getting a table with just 2 people and have had to wait up to a week, and then with a large party it was even more difficult. And also, they gave us two chutney samplers without asking, and then charged us for it. (We didn&#39;t dispute it - they were good. But still.)Will definitely come back again - I already know what I want to try next time.

4.5 STARS!!!My boyfriend took me to Japantown and I immediately thought that we were going to be eating sushi but instead he took me to Dosa. The restaurant itself is beautiful. I fell in love with all the decorations. Very elegant looking to me.Our waiter was friendly (can&#39;t remember his name) and gave us recommendations since it was our first time there. He was very knowledgable of the menu and was helpful. The waiter gave us this complementary snack before ordering and it was a great way to start the meal. I wish I knew what it was called, but I think it&#39;s some type of Indian chip or maybe bread?I ordered the chicken xacuti and the mango lassi. My boyfriend ordered the lamb dosa. The chicken xacuti is a curry dish and it was DELICIOUS. The sauce was spicy but not too overwhelming. It&#39;s served with coconut rice which is a good complement. As for the mango lassi (yogurt based smoothie), I thought it was average. It was not as sweet as the other mango lassi that I&#39;ve had in the past. The lamb dosa was delicious as well and it wasn&#39;t as heavy of a meal compared to the chicken xacuti. The staff are very quick in regards to refilling water glasses or responding to customers&#39; questions/requests.Reason why this place is 4.5 stars instead of 5: Despite the flavorful amazing food, I thought the pricing could have been maybe 2-3 dollars cheaper (at least during lunch time). Also, I thought $5 for a mango lassi was overpriced. I&#39;m used to paying $3 at other indian restaurants.Anyway, if you are in the Japantown area and don&#39;t have a particular craving for sushi TRY DOSA. The restaurant is gorgeous. The staff are friendly. The food (although overpriced) is flavorful and packed with a lot of spices. Go out and try it!I will definitely be coming back to DOSA in the future (and bringing friends/family to try it).

I was in SF for an evening and really wanted to go to State Bird Provisions. Silly me, walking in without a reservation and thinking I might be seated. The hostess suggested I try Dosa. I headed down there and found something that was not at all what I expected!The restaurant itself is really beautiful, with unusual, large-scale proportions.The service was fantastic. At first, I suspected our server was going to be completely overbearing, but he turned out to be fantastic. We were overwhelmed by the menu (not your traditional Indian restaurant fare, because it&#39;s Southern Indian, I guess?), asked him for suggestions, and he walked us through the menu in detail, pointing out his favorites and also the dishes that were popular among guess.All the food was intensely flavorful, beautiful, had a nice amount of heat without being too spicy (we had a couple of non-spice eaters in our party).When we sat down, they brought us a bowl of papadam. We were expecting some sort of sauce or something for dipping, but none was brought. So we dug in. It was really flavorful, with whole cumin seeds, and completely addictive.For four of us, we ordered two small plates and three larger dishes.Shredded Duck: A caramelized onion uttapam with duck vindaloo topped with tiny greens and some shredded watermelon radish. Beware, it&#39;s very tiny. However, it is highly delicious.South Indian Bhel Puri: An amazing salad of puffed rice, green mango, beets, potatoes, tomatoes, onion, cilantro. Everything is cut up into tiny pieces and is impossibly light (like, the weight when you spoon it onto your plate is nothing), crisp, and an amazing combination of flavors. Served with two different chutneys; one was green and chimichurri-esque, and the other was tamarind and sweet.White Truffle Masala Dosa: A huge, light dosa, crisp on the edges and softer in the middle, wrapped around mashed potatoes. The whole thing was buttery and redolent of white truffle. Super simple, but so delicious.Winter Uttapam: A thicker version of a dosa, almost like a frittata, with the toppings cooked into it. This one had sunchokes, potatoes, spinach, sundried tomatoes, trumpet mushrooms, and caramelized fennel. It was tasty, but with that line up of toppings, it wasn&#39;t as flavorful as I expected. The three sauces it was served with were all delicious: coconut chutney (mild), tomato chutney (a little heat), and sambar, this incredible soup that I ate straight out of the bowl. That may have been poor form, but it was totally worth it.Kerala Fish Moilee: Sustainably-caught halibut in a pool of a red coconut sauce that was impossibly flavorful, citrusy, and spiced, over coconut rice. There was this amazing salad served with it with Brussels sprouts, butternut squash, and caramelized red onion. The whole plate was just beautiful.I wasn&#39;t planning to drink...didn&#39;t even really want to, but I couldn&#39;t pass up the opportunity to try one of their cocktails once I saw the list. I would&#39;ve liked to try six of them, but settled on the Peony (Plymouth gin, hisbiscus masala nectar, coconut milk, lime, bird&#39;s eye chile). It was beautiful (a recurring theme at this place), light pink, opaque with coconut milk, and with a swath of lime zest on the top. It was balanced and flavorful, not too sweet, and the coconut milk was a nice counterpoint to the spiciness of the food.Dosa is totally unlike any other Indian restaurant I&#39;ve ever been to, and I loved it.

Ok! It&#39;s about time! Dosa is one of my favorite restaurants in SF. You can&#39;t go wrong here / the ambience - the food - the drinks - perfect! Especially if you love spice and exploring.Get ready to experience a meal filled with spices, favors and fresh ingredients. I love love love the sambar here! And that&#39;s my test for good South Indian food - so there!Other favorites - the Brussel sprouts that&#39;s on their seasonal menu, the Mung and watermelon salad, the paneer and mango dosa and the seasonal utthapams. If you have a craving for curd rice (I know I do once in while!) Dosa has one that will more than satisfy that craving!

I came here with my mom and some friends when she came to visit the city. I&#39;d never had dosa before so I was a little overwhelmed with what to expect, but it was pretty good. Our server was very nice. Luckily we got a reservation on Opentable so that it wasn&#39;t a long wait to get a table. We were seated in a quieter area of the restaurant, which was a relief, since it was so loud and crowded! Only real downside to the service was that because it was so busy, they forgot one of our appetizer orders and by the time they delivered it we were halfway through our dinner and had no room to eat more.I got the pumpkin dosa which was pretty good. I expected there to be pumpkin inside the dosa, but it was just a separate dip, which was sweet and yummy. Next time I come here I probably wouldn&#39;t eat the insides of the dosa--or maybe it was just the pumpkin dosa filling that was boring, just potatoes. My boyfriend got the paneer dosa which came in 3 little wraps instead of the large triangle, and I thought that one tasted really good.If you can come here DEFINITELY try the peony cocktail! SO GOOD! I had the Mango is the New Black cocktail which was ok but a little watery. My boyfriend had the specialty gin and tonic which he said was also alright, not really like a gin and tonic. But the Peony was sooooooo decadent and delicious and absolutely amazing. Yummmmm please.Maybe if I came here again we&#39;d just order a couple of dosas to share, instead of everyone ordering a separate dosa.

There are no shortage of Indian restaurants in the bay area but Southern Indian food is surprisingly different to find. Whoever came up with the business idea to bring the staple southern Indian fare to such a trendy spot is just pure ingenious. DOSA is truly one of a kind in the city (not counting its sister restaurant Dosa on Valencia of course).The restaurant is huge. There is a spacious bar, communal tables, lounging area as well as plenty of tables in two floors. Even then, the restaurant is a complete full house on the weekends. Reservation is not too too difficult to come by. Just need to call a few days in advance. Walk in or same day reservation might be possible but do not count on it. You don&#39;t want to wait for 45 minutes do you?The food was good. Very authentic in taste with much welcomed Californian twist featuring many locally sourced, farm fresh or organic ingredients. I can&#39;t say it was the best Southern Indian food I have had in the area. I could still name a handful of restaurants that would beat them in taste and price. However, none of those restaurants match this level of service and quality. You are paying extra for the service, excellent wine list and a nice ambiance. Let me tell you, it is totally worth it.The tasting menu is great for first timers. The portion is adjusted smaller so you get to try more things. Otherwise, just one order of their dosa could easily fill you up.I love the energetic ambiance but the tables were a little too close together for comfort. It is a fun place to bring your date to but not a place you could enjoy a more intimate and private conversation.

Amazing restaurant from start to finish. Everything has such a unique touch but still the authentic flavors. The drinks are very well crafted and interesting, and they do not skimp on the alcohol! You definitely get your money&#39;s worth and most have a unique twist that you won&#39;t find many other places, many drinks making use of Indian spices or flavors. The Steph Curry was the most unique, but if you aren&#39;t a bourbon drinker go for something more fruity such as Peony. The selection of gin drinks is outstanding if that&#39;s more your taste. For the food itself I don&#39;t even know where to begin. It is best to get several dishes and eat them family style. It is absolutely necessary to try the namesake and get a dosa. The white truffle dosa was particularly good. There are also many options available for those looking for a spicy adventure. If it says spicy, believe it. The calamari masala was the biggest surprise in terms of spicy, but the flavors were amazing. Of course there are plenty of fantastic options for vegetarians as well!

I think there&#39;s a big unmet need for upscale Indian dining and I wish there were more places like Dosa in SF!Loved virtually all of the food and most of the drinks.Tip: GO!Food:- Bhel Puri: nice and spicy- White Truffle Masala Dosa: this blew my mind, honestly. So creative and so delicious!- Raita: don&#39;t skimp on raita, the food here is spicy and you&#39;ll need it- Prawn Masala: definitely the standout curry of the evening. You have to try it!- Chennai Chicken: bit like Indian KFC, super delicious!Drinks:- Mango is the new black: I loved the name, but this was way too strong for my taste- Mango Lassi: really solid lassi. Thick, not too sweet, and no artificial coloring.- Ginger Ante: what a fabulous drink! Kind of like a jazzed up ginger beer.

Paired with coconut rice, the prawn masala meets your wildest curry dreams. The mandarin lentil salad was a fresh way to start the meal, along with glasses of light and airy Pinot Blanc. We sat at the bar and received menu recommendations from an bartender who looked like Dwayne Johnson. No complaints.The atmosphere is upscale trendy. We admired the funky, colorful light fixtures, especially the enormous &#34;jellyfish&#34; lights that dazzle the front area of the restaurant. The Fillmore concert hall is a five minute walk from Dosa, so you can enjoy a delicious contemporary Indian meal before a show.

We were only here for happy hour (before state bird) but I really want to eat here someday! It&#39;s like.. I love boyf on any given Sunday, cuddling on the couch or whatever, but wedding boyf in a suit is like whoa. Likewise, I love Indian food, so dressed-up Indian food is gonna blow my mind, right?Anywayyyy my gf and I both had a margarita and a red off the HH menu each. Bartender said there were 2 shots in each margarita, which would have been nice to know before I ordered my second drink. Needless to say, we were both pretty drunk at dinner. PS the drinks were quite good :) Nice ambiance too, the place was surprisingly uncrowded and we were able to snag the last couple seats at the bar.

Incredible. I know next to nothing (okay, just nothing...) about Indian food, so I can&#39;t speak to the authenticity of the flavors, preparations, etc. What I do know is that every dish I had here was delicious!We arrived 45 minutes late for our reservation on a Friday night due to some ridiculous traffic downtown. Thankfully, we called ahead and the hostess was gracious enough to seat us anyway. We started with a round of Peonys - gin, hibiscus masala nectar (!!), coconut cream, chile, and lime. It was a little bit too sweet for me, but that coconut cream was divine.Between the four of us, we split the spicy basil dosa, chef&#39;s selection of 5 uttapam, chicken korma curry, spicy basil prawns, a side of coconut rice, and bhatura. I loved the different chutneys and sambhar that arrived with the dosa and uttapam. The combination of spicy, smokey, cool / refreshing was perfect! There were so many flavors all at once. The curries were very good as well. The chicken was super tender and the prawns had this unique smooth and smokey taste to them. My favorites were the bhatura and the prawns.Even though we were stuffed, we still split 3 desserts between the four of us. I loved the fresh coconut cream custard. It was a tad too sweet because it was sitting in a light syrup but the coconut textures and flavors were so good that it didn&#39;t even matter. We also enjoyed the apricot chiboust, which was apricot tapioca with coconut cream on top. Our least favorite was the raspberry mascarpone tart. The only part I liked about the tart was the chantilly cream it came with :/.Dosa is a great spot for a date night or for catching up with friends. I will definitely be back!

What a place this is... great food, excellent service, and worth the wait!My wife and I went to Dosa in February without a reservation, and were told there&#39;s a 45-minute wait. We heard how good this place was though, and decided to wait -- excellent decision. Our server was extremely helpful and recommended a few dishes to us.We started with a special brussel sprouts dish, which was delicious. I also had an order of pekoras. For the entree, my wife had an uttapam, while I had a dosa. We both loved our dishes so much! So tasty! They have a lot of options for vegetarians and others with dietary restrictions -- my wife and I had no trouble finding something good!Since it is a little pricey, I&#39;d recommend it for special occassions. I&#39;m totally going back though!

This is a great place for a large, family-style, group dinner. Came here with a work group, and they sat us in the loft area (which is semi-private). Dosa was able to put together a crowd-pleasing menu (for a mix of folks from those who love Indian food to those who&#39;d never had it), provided excellent service, and were quick to refill wine.Food was fresh and flavorful. Prices are reasonable, and staff is accommodating.Great selection of beer, wine, and liquor.

I&#39;ve been to Dosa now twice and it was fantastic both times. The staff is on point - very friendly and responsive. This place is a bit pricier, but it&#39;s honestly so worth the cost. It&#39;s not one of those places that charges $10 more for a burger just because they can. The food, decor and cocktails are noticeably high quality and delicious. It&#39;s for sure some of the best Indian food I&#39;ve had.Try the Mango Prawns (great sweet spicy combo) and any of the Dosas. The cocktails are also a huge bonus of dining at Dosa. Each one is completely original and delicious. My favorite is the Peony - a lavender and coconut milk flavored concoction. I&#39;ve never had Indian dessert that I like except at Dosa - the gelatos are perfection. If you&#39;re brave, they even suggest forgoing silverware and going the traditional route of eating with your hands.This is a prime date or special event spot. It&#39;s located right across the street from Sundance Kabuki Cinemas - my favorite theater in SF and a great spot to round out a traditional dinner and a movie date.

Food was pretty good, but I was extremely disappointed in the service. I went with my friend who is allergic to mango and she ordered two dishes to split with our other friend and specifically told the server that she is allergic to mango so to please put any chutneys or sauces that include mango on the side. When the food came out, it was brought to our table by a food runner and not our actual waiter. So we started to eat and my friend noticed two slices of something yellow on top of her vegetables. She is overly cautious, so she flagged down our waiter to ask what it was. He said mango and started to walk away. She called him back over and reminded him that she is allergic and specifically asked that there be no mango on her dish. He looked flustered and she told him that our friend that she was splitting the meal with would eat the veggies with mago, but could he please bring another plate of veggies without mango. He said sure, but did not once apologize. I thought maybe because he was not apologetic they would comp the meal or discount our overall bill. They did neither. Luckily my friend is cautious, but they could have caused her to have a serious reaction. I understand mistakes happen, but the no apology is what really upsets me. I won&#39;t be eating here again.

Mmmmmmm, dosas. Dosas dosas dosas. I went here for a brunch/lunch type deal on a recent Sunday to catch up with a friend, and it did not disappoint. We each started with a mimosa and had a dosa. I can&#39;t remember what he had, but I had a pumpkin spice dosa that was out of this world. Seriously, it was oh-so-good. Perfect mix of sweet and savory, with that flaky dough. nomnomnom. Again, I can&#39;t remember what my friend had, but he loved it, so I have a feeling I could recommend any dosa on the menu.Because the only thing we had were dosas, I can&#39;t speak to anything else on the menu. But seriously, you come to a restaurant named Dosa on Fillmore and order something BESIDES a dosa? No. Just no. Get a dosa!I do wish it wasn&#39;t quite so expensive, but hey, it&#39;s good food and this is SF. It happens.

I haven&#39;t like Indian food in a very long time. The wifey wanted to go here and was making me feel bad about not taking her. So we went and damn she was right! This placed is tops in my book. All of the dosas should be tried. The dipping sauces are so good I started spooning them down my throat. Dosa made me a happy man. The wait staff was great and explained the menu thoroughly.Dosa didn&#39;t just prove to me that I was wrong about not giving them a chance earlier, dosa also proved I married the right girl.

After my 3rd time here, I&#39;d say focus on the small plates and the specialty cocktails. Don&#39;t expect an intimate setting but some of the music (loud) is pretty great.I love their presentation of the mango dessert and small plates. I&#39;m def going back because for $104 I got 3 small plates, 3 cocktails, a dessert and a small, sweet Late Harvest Zinfandel! I felt stuffed!

Dosa! I love you!Chris our server tonight was amazing. My dining experience tonight was great: right from checking in to paying the bill and heading out. Tonight I ordered:1. Vada pav (Indian sliders) *beware it can be very hot (spicy) so if you can&#39;t handle hot food, let your server know. A must try!!2. Rava dosa (semolina crepe): loved it. Crispy enough to my liking! So yummy with the sambhar and chutneys...highly recommend trying this as a change to the regular dosa3. Payasam dessert was delicious with just right amount of sweetness. The quantity is good for sharing between two to three people, so keep that in mind when ordering.4. BEST for the last: masala chai. So so so good!! Oh! If it hasn&#39;t been 8:00pm, I would have ordered another cup... Don&#39;t wanna stay up and hoot like an owl ;)I think Yelp has just outdone itself by adding this kickass feature to the Yelp app - composing, editing and posting reviews via the app!! Go Yelp!

We were expecting an authentic indian restaurant, but it was modern, as was the too loud music. The food was good but we asked for naan, which they didn&#39;t have, at an Indian restaurant?? Tthe place was noisy, and the waitress was neither welcoming nor serviceminded. She did select good wines for our meals though, The guys that came with the food just placed the dishes without asking or knowing who ordered what. All around an expensive disappointment.

Why Dosa&#39;s IS a 5-star place:When you are emotionally overcome with deep sadness upon taking the last bite of your meal... you know you&#39;ve eaten something special. I ordered the paneer and peas dosa. And it was gastronomical art. Accompanied with sambar and both a tomato and coconut chutney (I believe the coconut had cilantro in it - and I&#39;m one of those people who LOATHE cilantro, but in this? It was totally acceptable!), my heart physically ached upon taking that final bite. Goodbye, beautiful meal, thank you for existing!And yes, as the menu suggested, I totally used my fingers to eat... and classy restaurants that let me play with my food? INSTA-FIVE STAR.The servers were incredibly informed about the components of each dish. I appreciated how, in a totally non-pretentious way, that explained their concept, what went best with what, why things were made a certain way, etc. And, I was a little seduced by the atmosphere in general - the decor was uber tasteful and classy, the lighting was romantically low, the background music was house/techno, and the clientele was all over the map. I&#39;m one of those people who appreciate when four things that don&#39;t necessarily organically go together (fancyschmancy interior design, sexy time lighting, music that I want to rave to, and people I could either be having a business meeting or a bachelorette party with) do. Because in this instance, it totally works!However, there are two reasons why Dosa&#39;s ISN&#39;T getting 5-stars from me (feel free to stop reading here if you want, because they really are &#34;As good as it gets!&#34;, except for...)Reason #1, &#34;Space Invaders Are No Bueno With Me&#34; - Maybe it&#39;s because physically I&#39;m a tiny chick, but people often associate my stature with age. Being little =/= being young. And when you&#39;re &#34;young&#34; it&#39;s okay to have your personal space invaded (or so is the mindset of many adults). That being said, the waitstaff at Dosa&#39;s definitely invaded my personal space every go-around with the plates (something I didn&#39;t notice them doing with other people). They would stand in back of me, reach around my torso/face with two arms to lift or place plates over my head. Again, something that probably wouldn&#39;t even register on other folk&#39;s radars, but it did on mine. And...Reason #2, &#34;Petty, Petty Pie Princess&#34; - When I found out we were going to Dosa&#39;s, I did what any sane yelper does - I looked up their menu. The very first thing that caught my eye was some banana goat cheese pie thing. SOLD. That was the single thing I look forward to eating. When it came time for dessert, though, guess what wasn&#39;t on the menu? Mhmm, the banana goat cheese pie. We asked the server if they still carried it. &#34;I&#39;m sorry, we don&#39;t. But it was SOOOOOOO good. Like... seriously, so, so, so good. It&#39;s really too bad we don&#39;t carry it anymore,&#34; was her response. I don&#39;t want to hear how delicious something I can&#39;t have is, so the appropriate response - in my obviously humble opinion - would have been: a) &#34;I&#39;m sorry, we don&#39;t,&#34; (which is to the point without telling me whether it was good or not leaving me opinion-less and not dessert h&#39;angry) or, b) &#34;Not anymore. It wasn&#39;t that good anyway,&#34; with a wink and a playful smile (which is more fun and less braggy).In the end... my advice? Go to Dosa&#39;s. Eat then weep at how gorgeous your meal was.(Then weep some more because of a dessert you can&#39;t have.)

Utterly delighted to know someone out there is spending time, money and energy to make Indian food elevated and fancy. And not losing the essence of good taste and exceptional variety that Indian food offers. And yes, am one of those to order Dosa at Dosa. Keema dosa it was...not divine but was very happy with it after a long walk and accompanied by good folks in SF. The best on the table was the very well presented Dahi -bhalla. The cocktails were innovative but not many vodka choices. Emerald Monk was spicy and punchy. I&#39;d be happy to recommend Dosa to anyone- it showcases the wonder of Indian cuisine well to any global gourmand.

Eating at Dosa is like a foodsplosion. Although Dosa has great ambiance, I don&#39;t really care at all about the decor, the atmosphere, the paucity of indoor stroller parking spots, or the uuns-uuns dinner techno. I care about the food.If you&#39;ve eaten Ethiopian or Eritrean food, you might be familiar with injera. Dosa is like that. Less similar, but similar in concept, are roti, tlayuda, tortilla, pizza, etc. Dosa is the food and the utensil. There are several kinds of batter available, and some dosas are smeared with chutney. There&#39;s mung (MOONG) bean, semolina, wheat... They offer vegan and vegetarian dosas.If you really want to get adventurous, get the Thali. It&#39;s a variety of incredible little dishes including rasam, curry, a rice thingie.Disclaimer: I&#39;m white. If I like it, yes, you might like it too!

There are hits and misses with this restaurant. I&#39;ve been here a handful of times now with different groups to order different things.Ambience:Beautiful two-story restaurant with nice light fixtures and classy atmosphere. Although, once we sat upstairs and I thought the images of skinny village children and old men were not comforting as we indulged in rich foods.Service:Always promptly seated when you have reservations and the entire group shows up. Service is efficient and friendly. Minus a chutney episode we had the last time for Ayesha&#39;s birthday. Basically one of the managers flung a spoon of chutney on three girls while picking up the plates (one of them being the b&#39;day girl!) It kinda put a damper on our evening because we were supposed to go out afterward to Harry&#39;s but instead they spent time in the bathroom; hand-drying their pants. The guy as nice enough to reimburse them for dry cleaning although it&#39;s still a pain to deal with.Food:+Chennai Chicken- probably my favorite thing on the menu; spicy but tasty breaded chicken with yogurt dipping sauce+Samosas- regular North Indian samosa and South Indian samosa with masala filling+Vada Pai- OMG SO SPICY; i was drinking water for 10 minutes with shots of raw sugar and couldn&#39;t enjoy the rest of my meal; also ended up with a stomach ache because of this+Idli Fries- interesting concept; its basically a fried idli in the shape of a wedge fry+Collard Green Dosa- not my favorite; collard greens just don&#39;t mix with dosa+Paper Dosa- typical standard dosa with a side of sambar+Paneer &amp; Peas Dosa- I thought I&#39;d like this but the peas were throwing off the taste+Lamb Keema Dosa- the lamb comes on the side and its perfectly seasoned+Uttapam- this was a favorite at the table and the mushroom one looked great+Bengali Gimlet- amazing gin-based drink and I&#39;m Bengali so this was a must-have for meI prefer Udupi Palace in the Mission to Dosa for food but Dosa has its ambiance I guess.-Hungry Hungry Pongy

Great Place ! Definitely worth a try. It is a fancy place and is expensive but you won&#39;t regret spending money on good food. This is not a place you would eat every other day or every weekend. I was there two days ago.We were 3 people and ordered their 3 course tasting menu. It was $42 per person, by the end of third course (small portions) we were full (right amount). I am used to eating lot if food so it was not enough for. Food was still great.

Is not bad, but not sure if I&#39;d return. I came here with a friend to catch up, and didn&#39;t realize I was walking into a date spot. It&#39;s ok. I have a special friendship. We can deal.We weren&#39;t too hungry, and ordered a Paper Dosa and the Mushroom uttapam (like a savory pancake thing). The staff were really nice about explaining how to eat it, as I have not been to Dosa in years (I&#39;m going to say...like, 6 years now?). Always fun to eat with your hands (mostly) though!The 2 items were just enough for us. We saw the curries were a bit pricey, and we weren&#39;t too hungry so just went with these 2 items. It ended up to be perfect for how hungry we were.The staff were very friendly, and were attentive without being too overbearing. My water was never more than 1/2 empty, and they were quick about picking up any empty plates. Food was good, and overall a great experience! It IS a little pricey for Indian food, but for the price and the environment, its not a bad deal.

Oh my oh my oh my. The Dosa&#39;s alone are worth crossing the city for. Try the Masala Chutney Dosa and share around the table (or hoard it for yourself!)The food here is creative, fresh and flavorful. It&#39;s also pricy but maybe that&#39;s just the Filmore neighborhood? Take my advice, spend some time with the drinks menu, the mixologists here are fantastic.I saw a couple of reviews here that complained about the service, but it was fine for me and everybody tells me I&#39;m the worst service critic around.For the person who complained that people kept joining the table and then wanting to order? That&#39;s service nightmare, How would you like to try to get all those orders in and then have to add, add, change, add and then the customer wants all the food together? Jeez. Get over it, the problem is you not the servers&#39;.This is why restaurants don&#39;t seat a party until everybody is there. Simply rude.

Been to both the locations a countless times (Dosa @ Fillmore &amp; Valencia) but this one hands down is my favorite..What we usually order:-Tamil Lamb with Malaysian Paranthas: Spicy &amp; YUM (Lately for some reason, they are mostly out of their malaysian paranthas)-Dahi Rice: It used to be really good but taste has gone down a bit the past two times I have ordered it. It always needs some seasoning!-Paneer &amp; Peas Dosa: My Husband&#39;s all time favorite!! Their Paper Masala Dosa and Chile Utthapam is pretty decent as well-Idli Sambhar: Super-Chennai Chicken: Another yummer-Lamb Chops: Little sweet for my indian taste buds-Vada Pav: Mini sliders..Perfect and so tasty!This was definitely a 5 starred restaurant for us, but in my last two visits to Dosa, I was a little unhappy with my Dahi rice and Sambhar, and hence the 4 stars. Another thing that I usually get very annoyed with is their constant menu changes, another downer for me.Not a big fan of their desserts except one, so if you love mangoes, make sure you leave some room for their mango pudding, tried &amp; tested many times!! :)Tip: Weekdays or Weekends, the place is always crowded, so always best to make reservations.

The host staff are really prompt and patient.The negative part is that the place can get really loud and cozy, as tables are literally stacked next to each other. The folks on the neighboring table would be right in your &#39;bubble&#39; or personal space. I love to have my food spicy and asked the waiter if they could make my Biryani spicy, to which they responded that the Biryani is generally not as spicy. They didn&#39;t even try :)Verdict: I would totally recommend this place, if you need to catch up on some flavorful Indian food and do not care much about the price tag or personal space. I would not recommend this place if you need to catch up on a date or peaceful family dinner.

Dosa sf is expensive indian fare. They have a lot of good things going for them.Pros:Great ambience.They have the best vada Pav dare say better than the ones in Mumbai. There I said it. The trick - Carmelized onions and perfectly spiced.Their warm toddy is absolutely amazing.Pumpkin soup is awesome.Uttappam and sambar is amazing.The papad that is given free is soooo good.Moong salad is very nice.Coconut rice and stew is out of the world. The spices sort of make love in your mouth in a very nice way :)Cons:Expensive indian food and drinks.Dosa is ok.

This is an upscale indian restaurant in SF. The place looks really cool when you enter inside. It has a full bar and there is no way you can imagine this place serves indian food. I have tried the watermelon, panner and moong salad, vada, uttappam and panner dosa. All of them were really very tasty. Dosa is served with two different types of chutneys: coconut and tomato chutney and also with Sambar.Its an upscale and elegant place. I could call it a fine dining probably. The food is very expensive compared to the same quality of food in south bay. However, I think the price is only for the location. Something to try when you are in the SF area.

Ordered a pickup, and was told to come in 15 mins. When I went to pick it up, I was told that it will be ready in a few minutes. 20 mins later, order is still nowhere to be seen. Everytime I go and ask, they act as if they are talking to me for the first time. No one bothers to check inside to find why order is late. Worst service ever!!

There was a long wait to get seated but they were able to get us to the community table earlier. Food was just okay. It was like eating Indian food cooked by a non-Indian chef. Nice presentation but lacking the zest and taste that Indian food especially the South Indian food is known for.Definitely not a good choice if you are seeking good authentic South Indian food. And over priced.

Upscale-y, bistro-y Indian that still has a soul. Dosa is as sophisticated as any place on Fillmore, it has a very lively, young bar scene and it has killer Indian food. Not a bad combo for a change of pace. If I had a nit it would be that it could be spicier, meaning hotter. The flavors were great, but I kind of expect duck vindaloo to light my head on fire. Dosa&#39;s tasted great, but there was no fire. Oh well.The signature item, dosas, are really very nice and they come with wonderful dipping sauces. My wife and I said that next time we might just make our dinner several dosas and leave it at that.

[gluten free]Couldn&#39;t have predicted one of my favorite spots in the city would be Indian food. Just didn&#39;t think it was my thing. Then BOOM. Dosa.If you&#39;re looking for gluten free options, you&#39;ve got a ton of choices here. Ask for the separate GF menu.Favorites:- Masala dosa and the sweet potato dosa- Chutney sampler- Chennai chicken (yes, it&#39;s GF)So, why not 5 stars? Service isn&#39;t out-of-this world and why are those beaded lights above the bar at Dosa Fillmore so dusty?

The good:- Nice decor, and great for groups because of the space and the seating arrangements they have available.- The Vada Pav (vegetarian sliders) were super tasty.- the white truffle dosa was yummy too - but I was suprised to find that it just had mashed potatoes in it. I was hoping for more!The bad:- our server had a weird personality and attitude; because we were a party of 6, gratuity was automatically included, so maybe that is why...- I didn&#39;t think the Crispy Fish Pakora was anything special.-the Lamb Pepper Fry was not very appetizing. I didn&#39;t like the seasoning on the rice either.- Surprised to hear that the Peony was SF&#39;s drink of the year at one point... but I may be biased because I just don&#39;t like spices/chili in my drinks.

The food is amazing here, but my rating unfortunately has to do with the service, specifically in seating. We came as a party of two and watched for an hour and a half as parties of two who came after us *without a reservation* were seated before us. I don&#39;t understand what their algorithm is for seating people but it seems simple enough to me--seat people in order they come in and as tables fill up. Pretty frustrated and would absolutely not recommend coming here unless you have a reservation or are prepared to wait. Sorry DOSA, maybe next time!

Great quality food! Tried the vada pav- 5/5 for creativity and taste. Also had the truffle dosa- was great and impressive. The truffle oil could be a little heavy later as regular dosa eaters like me r new to truffle oil with dosa. I am going to try this dosa at home :) only suggestion would be to serve indian pickles with curd rice. Our curd rice had no pickles, that&#39;s like a pizza with no cheese :(Overall A Fab Place And Is My Absolute favorite place

I loved loved loved (!) my first time at Dosa last night. It felt like the ultimate place to be. The decor was hip and swanky and the service was efficient and comfortable as well. We ordered some drinks first, which were all so well done. The Steph Curry made me change my mind about Bourbon. I&#39;d start drinking Bourbon for sure if it all tasted like Dosa&#39;s Steph Curry. My drink, the gin-based Peony, was excellent and frothy, but it was pretty sweet. Flower Child was ethereal and beautiful looking and tasted just as delicious as it looked. We then ordered some small plates and salads, dosas following, and then entrees for a family-style dining experience that worked seamlessly for our long, comfortably-paced meal. The spice level across the board was a little more than I am used to- but I took it as a friendly challenge that yielded great results. The goat cheese &amp; little gem salad reminded me of salads I&#39;ve had before from other cuisines, but it was deliciously dressed. The goat cheese balls were melt-in-your-mouth tasty and the spiced walnuts sent me to honeyed heaven. And the scallops- perfectly cooked and perfectly spiced. I didn&#39;t eat the duck tacos, but those in my party who did said they were amazing. My father remarked they were his favorite part of the meal. We had the sweet potato dosa which was deliciously sweet; it paired well with the white truffle dosa. The mango prawn entree was soooo delicious; as a pescetarian, I relished in the fact that they had such a delicious seafood dish. I enjoyed the fragrant coconut rice that complimented the sweet and spicy mango sauce. My fellow diners had the lamb chops- I heard they were good but 6 of them split 3 chops (1 order) and each portion didn&#39;t seem to be more than one bite of lamb- fortunately that didn&#39;t affect me. Our waitress Jenny was calm, kind, and very helpful with the menu. She expertly gauged how many dishes we&#39;d need for our party size, and everything turned out nicely. It was a smoothly paced dinner that felt luxurious and magical- all due to the spectacular food, alluring decor, and personable service. I&#39;ll definitely be back- and urging my friends to go too!

Amazing dinner here. I had sampled a little bit of a truffle dosa on a Japantown food tour, and wanted to come back and get the full dinner experience. Hubby and I started off with the duck taco appetizer, which was yummy, and had won some award for best taco in SF. It was spicy and unique, and we loved it. They also gave us pappadam to munch on while waiting for our food. The pappadam wafers were light and crispy and yummy. We had a fabulous guy who was not our server, but clearing tables and checking on people. He was so accommodating and brought me tamarind sauce for my pappadam, because that is my favorite dipping sauce. I plowed through so many pappadam, that he refilled our basket and brought more sauce. Hubby got the mushroom uttapam and I got the truffle dosa I&#39;d been dreaming about. Both were excellent. Again, our wonderful guy came by with extra sauces and also boxed up our left over food and put extra tamarind sauce in there for me. It&#39;s not often that somebody goes so above and beyond that I feel I have to give an extra tip for the service, but this guy deserved it. I don&#39;t know how they split the tips with the main servers, but I wanted to make sure this guy got a little recognition for being so awesome. Our server was very sweet too, and it was a great dining experience all around. I love the swanky look and feel of this restaurant and highly recommend it for excellent South Indian cuisine. This place is a winner!

I eaten here twice, both on special occasions when both the ambiance and food were important. I&#39;m a huge fan of indian food and love a chance to enjoy it in such a beautiful setting. I love the tasting menu but it is quite pricey so not something I could do on a regular basis. There are wonderful and plentiful vegetarian, gluten free, and vegan options on the menu, and they even have a separate list that itemizes these dishes so it&#39;s easier to choose from (great when you&#39;re dining with people with food allergies and restrictions). The Dosa menu is fabulous, but I&#39;m not a big fan of the uttapam personally, so I would stick to the Dosas..Looking forward to my next visit!

Awesome South Indian food after a long time. Karaikudi chicken is the best. A different take on the traditional Vada Pav is alright. Rasam is kick ass. An excellent tasting Rasam dish is the mark of a good South Indian Restaurant. Ended the meal with some good old fashioned masala chai, which went perfectly with a chilly SF afternoon.

I was introduced to this place by a friend about a year ago and since have visited this place multiple times. It&#39;s a fancy Indian-fusion restaurant and it definitely brings out the wow-factor.Personally, I think their vada pav are to die for! I have had some amazing vada pavs back home in India but this one is different and exceptionally good.Their chilli uttapam is a must try for someone who has a stomach for spicy food. The chilli uttapam has habenero chillies and it leaves your face flushing, nose running and eyes watering. I have a picture to vouch for it!I recently tried thier Chennai chicken and it was mind blowing. They also have some very interesting cocktails to offer.

I usually follow the Spice Route to Dosa Valencia, but Dosa Fillmore is a good place to alight, much like the Cape of Good Hope. Liquor=good hope.Spice Route cocktails feature some new world wonders-lime, curried nectar, allspice, mango juice, jackfruit! After one cocktail, you&#39;ll need the feast to come.While variety may be the spice of life, the paper masala dosa is the bread and butter of Dosa-sans butter. I love how it looms menacingly off of the plate, and with each bite of crispy dosa, potato, lentil, and cashew it becomes somewhat more contained. Usually I&#39;m full by the time it reaches the confines of the plate, but I keep on going because it is part of the journey.To ensure that you have adequate provisions for the voyage ahead, you must order the South Indian Moons uttapam-five savory pancakes selected by the chef, accompanied by chutneys and sambar.I&#39;ve veered off my beaten path on a few occasions. The Hyderabadi Chicken Biryani is a basmati rice bowl of tender chicken with Indian aromatics, and the masala dosa is a triangular pocket of potatoes, onions, and cashews. Both worthy excursions from the uttapam-paper masala route that I&#39;ve carved out for myself.Even though Dosa Valenica is obtaining a liquor license soon, I think I&#39;ll voyage here more often. The interior is so beautiful, the space so expansive, and the location perfect for a pre or post-Kabuki theater meal.

Venue:Came here on a Wednesday night and was immediately impressed with the decor. This was an upscale Indian restaurant and it sort of surprised me since I didn&#39;t know what to expect coming in - gf made the reservation.Food:Decent. We started with the Chennai chicken and Paper Dosa which were both quite tasty. I&#39;ve never had Dosa before so it was very interesting and i walked away a fan. The 3 dipping sauces were unique and I would recommend trying all three together.My one complaint was that our entree (lamb curry with lemon rice) took way too long to come out and wasn&#39;t very good at all.Overall it is a nice date spot and I&#39;d come back again to try other dishes but for Indian food I prefer to go to a hole in the wall like Pakwan.

For those unfamiliar with Indian food: I pity you when coming here for the first time. For those unfamiliar with SOUTH Indian food, you&#39;ve got a fighting chance to enjoy the full potential of this incredible restaurant, but it might be a struggle.I&#39;ve never experienced an effort at South Indian cuisine like this outside of India, in my life. To be clear, the menu is obviously designed to minimize the damage from being a Southern restaurant in a society that is really only familiar with Northern, and that is, Punjabi, mom and pops named some variation of Delhi, Taj, India, or Gandhi. Cultured Americans know naan and chicken tikka masala. But even they tend not to know idli and sambar. So, there are plenty of northern stand-bys on the menu when you first open it. You actually have to dig deep into the third page before the South Indian dosa offerings come up. The less adventurous will have plenty of familiar entrees to choose from.And that&#39;s too bad. A couple seated next to us were quite obviously confused when they got their menus. The poor things asked some silly question of the waitress, who politely tried to explain to them that there are no tandoori ovens at South Indian restaurants, which is why there was no naan. They then opted to order the one thing that they figured looked and tasted most like naan: bhatura (a North Indian bread). The world of dosas would remain untouched by them.There are so many stunningly delicious variations of amazing Indian recipes on this menu that I almost want to fly out to San Francisco again just for the sake of sampling more. This is only my second time at Dosa. Here&#39;s to the next time.

The exterior signage was inviting but the interior was even better. The welcoming hostess seated us, the server was friendly and knowledgeable. And the food. Fantastic. The portions were large. We went with the 3 course summer tasting menu and we would have been fine splitting it and maybe adding some naan and an appetizer. It&#39;s not inexpensive but it is highly recommended.

Went here for lunch on a Saturday and really enjoyed our time compared to dinner. For one thing, everything is cheaper! I don&#39;t like to pay a lot for Indian food LOL. You can get the best for cheap. Also for weekends they have the South Indian Thali, which is a combination of 10-12 curries, chutneys, etc small dishes. LOVE it!! And great deal for $17 (with lamb, $15 for vegetarian). It reminded me of dim sum.. so kinda like Indian dim sum! So yeah we&#39;ll be back for weekend lunch!

This place sucked the life out of me. Way too much pomp and circumstance!! They hide their mediocre food, horrible service and crazy attitude behind a long menu, fancy names for usual Indian food, glittering decor and big price tag. The woman who stands behind a computer screen and has the power to give you a place to sit had way too much attitude and wouldn&#39;t put us on a list to get a table. Either sit on the communal table or get out. OK, we drove a long way in evening traffic to be here so we will sit at the communal table. NO NO.. those seats are reserved you will have to move to those other seats.. OK.. NO NO I meant those two seats.. Come on get down from you ivory tower, get your act together and move your lazy legs before we sit down. That basically killed the experience. Then the service was way too slow... it took 20 minutes for them to get the order in.. followed by silly food that didn&#39;t taste as good as it looked. I wouldn&#39;t recommend this place even to my mother in law!

Wife and I decided to hold our Indian family baby shower here this past weekend and we had the most wonderful experience. Dan Dowdell was our point-man and he did an incredible job. Our group was about 50 people (including a couple of kids) and Dan helped us create an incredible brunch menu of apps and dosas. On the big day, Dan and the entire staff provided simply incredible and attentive service. Everything was delicious and the food was served perfectly warmed and seasoned. Dan kept a watchful eye on the crowd and ensured that no one (including the kids) were without food or drink. We had reserved the private room upstairs and it was the perfect mix of intimate and yet roomy with tall windows overlooking the gorgeous restaurant and Post St.We couldn&#39;t have wished for a better experience. Thanks so much Dan and the entire crew at Dosa. We&#39;ll definitely be back for moer.

I was craving for dosa and found this gem when looking for dosa places. I went here with a friend. We reached there 25 mins before our reserved time, but they were able to seat us within 5 mins. And it was pretty crowded, so we were really happy that they could accommodate us.The cocktails here are really good, but I guess I was expecting them to be more exotic. So between the two of us we had- Bengali Gimlet- Ginger Ante- Gin and TonicThe curry flavor in Bengali Gimlet was very mild as was the cardamom flavor in Gin and Tonic. I would have loved them if these flavors a bit stronger.For starters, we tried the Watermelon Paneer salad. It has mung beans and some spices and herbs. It was so light and refreshing. I highly recommend it.The masala dosa here is to die for! I had the one with spicy basil. The best dosa I ever had in the US! The sambar was spicy and pretty authentic.And for dessert, we had the Coconut Milk Panna Cotta. Sweet and spicy!! Just the way I like it

My wife, and I had the opportunity to dine at DOSA on Fillmore during Dine about Town in January. DOSA on Fillmore is a vibrant and elegant place that has fantastic food to enjoy with friends and loved ones.Food &amp; Drinks: [$36.95/ea.

For our first dish the Puri had a nice sweet crunchy texture that was spot on. The scallops were good, but didn&#39;t stand out compared to the second and third course. Now the DOSA&#39;s, that was just amazing! A warm gooey cheese inside cooked perfectly, and when you dip it into the sauces it just melts in your mouth. The Uttapam was like any other pancake-style item that taste good, but taste even better once you dip it into the sauces! Our third and final course made the dinner even more spectacular as the flavors just popped. The Tamil Lamb has a nice spicy kick to it (medium) that brings out the wonderful flavors, while the Chicken &amp; Eggplant tasted great with the lemon rice. The wine&#39;s for each course complimented the dishes well.As for the service, it was just mediocre. We had to wave our hands to get their attention as they just walked by us a few times without even looking or seeing how we&#39;re doing.Last but not least, it&#39;s nice to know that &#34;DOSA is committed to sustainable &amp; healthy choices by using local &amp; organic ingredients as much as possible, natural, free-range &amp; grass-fed lamb, cage-free eggs, anti-biotic-free &amp; hormone-free chicken, fresh &amp; sustainably-caught fish and non-GMO oils.&#34;Quick Tips:* Make reservations!* Get there at least 15 minutes early to find parking!* Full menu is online.The Good: Fantastic Flavorful Foods | Vibrant Atmosphere | Elegant DecorThe Bad: Service | Parking

We walked in 5 minutes after their afternoon closing time, the super nice Manager and hostess let us grab a table and order, they were honest about setting the expectation we had to order quickly since the kitchen was closing, very fair, I value straightforwardness.We ordered a number a things, I cannot remember a single dish name, but every single of the 6-8 items we ordered were AMAZING. This was my first time trying southern Indian food, which apparently is a deviation from the usual dishes.Nevertheless...Food: is fantastic, the best Indian i have ever had. Their &#39;breads&#39; (chips and the like) were to die for.Service: the staff was super nice and attentive, they all seemed happy which makes a tremendous difference.Presentation: very nice, orderly and clean.Quantity: proportional with price, this is not a cheap Indian buffet but it will get your stomach what it needs to survive while pleasing your palate.Price: its expensive for Dinner, but very moderate-average for lunch.Ambiance/Decor: modern, very nice and clean.I am SO coming back!

Dosa used to be a great place for a drink at the great bar and fun delicious (maybe not authentic but who cared) Indian food. The service was always very good.Haven&#39;t been there in over a year and it has fallen off so badly its tragic. The bartender was a d!ck straight up. Our waiter was ok but the vibe was like I was at a TGI Fridays. I don&#39;t know if the place got sold or what but it&#39;s changed in a bad way.The food was barely ok. Clearly a lot of pre-made food that had been sitting in a freezer. Just sad.Used to be great. Now it Suxx.Staff staff staff. Train them!

Every time I come here I have no idea what to order because there are so many delicious options.Being that I am gluten intolerant Indian food is always an easy go to for me...even though I spent most of my time resisting the delicious naan and dosa. Usually when I come here I either have to bring an Indian friend with me or ask the waiter what I should order. I could probably come here every month and never order the same thing!Everything I have ever had here is delicious and the atmosphere is just Devine. The waiters are always helpful and attentive which are the two most important things that I look for in customer service. So if you haven&#39;t been here before I say go and give this upscale Indian a try.

Few Tips - Make an advance booking before going.If you are a family with kids, go during lunch. Their dinner menu costs double, compared to lunch.If you are on a date/couple, dinner is definitely worth, as the ambience is lovely in the night.No doubt the food tastes really good. Credit goes to their Exec-chef, as all the items I have tried so far is close to perfection.I am not impressed with the staff at the front-desk and their waitresses.

Came here for lunch and we realized we definitely should have come here for dinner. The interior here is great and the service was excellent, but I thought the lunch menu was lacking compared to what they offer for dinner. I&#39;ll definitely come back and update my review once I can sample their dinner menu (especially their lamb dish)

This place is amazing!I had some scallops for an appetizer and they practically melted in my mouth. So delicious! The decor is also awesome! Definitely an impressive place. The service was great too with multiple servers pitching in to make our dinner flow smoothly.Highly recommended as one of the best restaurants on the Fillmore!

On my visit to the bay, my good friend and his lovely girlfriend took me and my lady to this place. Apparently this has been their go-to place for Indian cuisine and it just so happened to be the last day for Dine About Town! Lucky us!_what I ordered:- Kale Pakora:: I&#39;m not the biggest fan of kale but this salad tasted fresh with subtle flavors. It was light and delicious.- Lamb &#39;Keema&#39; Dosa:: I have never had dosa before but I LOVE it! It was served with (3) different condiments varying on the spectrum of spice: coconut chutney, tomato chutney, and sambar. I believe that is the order from mildest to spiciest. If you are sensitive to spiciness, ask for the spiel on each (there is one gentleman that does an exquisite job at explaining it; it&#39;s theatrical!).- Chicken Xacuti:: the chicken would literally fall off of the bone. it was perfect._atmosphere/service:This is a very elegant, nice sit-down restaurant. The interior was very clean with very high ceilings and large-scale art to add to the ambiance._parking:There&#39;s a parking structure adjacent to the restaurant. I&#39;m not sure what the rates are because my friend covered it (thanks, Alex!).

Dosa is going to be my inaugural entry for my new list: Places to Eat Alone and Not Feel Like a Dork. Yes, I&#39;m single-handedly bringing back the word Dork. So there.Dosa has a regular bar where you can eat, but I love the big community table just past the hostess station. It makes you feel like you&#39;re still part of the bigger restaurant as a whole, but you don&#39;t feel like you stand out when you&#39;re eating alone. I will often dip in somewhere to grab a bite, as the teens have all their activities and I&#39;ve sometimes gotta kill some time and it&#39;s mealtime.So Wednesday night, came in around 7:30 and no problem to sit at the community table. Very friendly, very competent service. After asking a few questions, I landed on ordering the Bhel Puri and just the straight up classic Masala dosa. When the Bhel Puri came, I had completely forgotten what was in it....but it was so delicious that I gobbled it down pretty quickly. Looking at their online menu now, it was puffed rice, roasted parsnips, potatoes, tomatoes, onions &amp; tangerines, flavored with spicy mint and tamarind chutneys. I highly recommend it. Then the dosa came...and it was just fine. It&#39;s not the first time I&#39;ve been here, and not the only place I&#39;ve had dosas, but it had been awhile so I was somewhat surprised when the filling seemed to be all plopped into the middle of the crepe-like outside. No big deal - I spread it around as I tore it off and dipped it sauces. But just a little odd.Anyway, of course I started chatting up the ladies who were seated across from me, as we had seen each other in line at the film festival we just came from, so I spent most of the evening talking with them....so never felt like I was alone. But if I had never talked with anyone, I still would have felt extremely comfortable here eating alone.

This is one of my top 10 favorites in SF so far. I loved my dinner here. The ambiance is nice, the service was quick and our waitress recommended us really good dishes.I really liked the biryana chicken and rice, the lamb chops, and one of the appetizers with popped rice (and guac yum!). The paper dosa is on the 7x7 list, and it&#39;s humongous, but I wasn&#39;t a huge fan of it. It&#39;s crispy and thin, and big enough to share one amongst the entire time (we had 4 people), and you basically dip pieces of the dosa into sauces given.The staff was really nice, and it&#39;s a great dinner spot to catch up with friends. I thought the food was quality, and I&#39;d recommend it as one of my favorite go to restaurants in SF. Best of all, the wait isn&#39;t horrible because it&#39;s pretty big inside!

It&#39;s HARD to get in here on weekend nights! Even to sit at the bar. :( I think we walked in on a weeknight around 8:30 and were able to squeeze in for a 2 person table. It&#39;s a classy venue--great for a night out or a fancy dinner before or after a movie at the Kabuki theater!We got the Duck Vindaloo per Yelp reviews, but it was a bit spicy..even for my Indian boyfriend&#39;s tastes!The truffled masala dosa was very interesting--frighteningly oily to the touch, but tasty in moderation. A little heavy after a while. If heavy foods are not for you, share with one or more other people.

Dosa on Fillmore (DoF) is a very peculiar Indian restaurant. Our waitress recommended the house special flat bread creations: two dosas and one uttapam. Presentation is gorgeous. Flavors are spicy and potent. The house chips and a pale ale from Paso Robles saved me from overload. I can&#39;t handle much in the way of hot hot food, and I slipped in under the danger zone tonight at DoF.The included soup is too intense, but I managed to consume half of it. The included green chutney is mild and pleasant, but the red sauce isn&#39;t.Decor and furnishings are spectacular. Sit in a corner booth if you can for comfort and people watching.Take the advice of your server. One dish each is plenty filling, especially when you share. The overall trend is quite spicy, but you will survive with your server&#39;s assistance.I had the huge sweet potato dosa, and it was impressive and flavorful. My wife had the summer uttapam that was attractive and delicious. My favorite was actually our friend&#39;s spicy chile dosa that was not too spicy at all, and had excellent flavors and texture.Salted caramel ice cream was fine for mini-dessert, but the toasted cocoanut sorbet was a total dud: grainy and lacking in cohesiveness.Not sure if we&#39;ll return any time soon, but it was very memorable and high quality.

I love this place! It&#39;s got a trendy ambiance and some killer cocktails. The food is so good (&amp; spicy!). I love spicy food so the Vada Pav is a must. As are the samosas and the White Truffle Dosa. Honestly, portions are huge so family style is best. As for drinks, I liked the Mango is the New Black, and the Peony.It is on the pricier side, so definitely a place to enjoy on special occasions.

I&#39;ve never had a bad meal at DOSA. I&#39;ve never had bad service at DOSA. I love that they change up their menus at times, yet also keep my favorites. Mumsy and I came here for our post-massage, birthday treat.Mumsy is a bit hard of hearing (when she wants to be!) so we opted for the mezzanine - the high vaulted ceilings (I&#39;m told it was formerly a bank) is not conducive to intimate convos, but upstairs the acoustics are better.Our waiter was very helpful and all the staff will help you with any food decisions. We went all vegetarian with the Seasonal Squash Pakora (I think I inhaled the first three), the Dahi Vada (which was beautiful and delicious - I wish I&#39;d taken a photo!), and the Paper Masala (two small plates and one dosa). It didn&#39;t seem like a lot but it was so filling and so delicious that I continued to eat after I was full.Also, I left a paper bag with some odds and ends at my table and the waiter ran after us chased me across the street in the rain to return it to me - so sweet!

Glad I finally got a chance to try Dosa out, after walking by regularly and hearing about it so much. It&#39;s very elegant and beautiful inside, with high ceilings and big wooden tables, but still maintains a comfortable and kwasi-casual atmosphere.We had a drink at the bar while waiting for the rest of our party, which is very open and sleek. I had the Bengali Gimlet, with curried nectar and lime juice, which was exquisite. I love the use of curry- very inventive and flavorful. We had made a reservation for Sunday dinner for 4 only a few hours before but they seated us with no problem in the cozy upstairs dining room after the other two had arrived.Food! I tried:Prawn-Chili Fry - I thought this was just okay, but one really loved this.Samosas - Very tasty, I do love me some ground, spiced veggies stuffed in friedpastries and dipped into varying flavor-packed sauces. Nailed it! The other star here was actually a small side salad, dressed in what seemed to be some sort of lemon-cumin vinaigrette. I wish I could order more of this as an entire dish as well!Chennai Chicken - Not too crazy about this dish, something was a bit lacking for me.White Truffle Masala Dosa - I may be a sucker for anything with truffles, but this one knocked it out of the park. A giant, thin crepe that is simultaneously pillowy-soft, yet crispy, filled with creamy, spiced, mashed potatoes and white truffle oil, served alongside three unique (fantastic!) sauces for tearing and dipping. We inhaled it in less than two minutes and had to order another.The staff was very friendly, prompt, and knowledgeable of the menu, and the food was overall delicious. Price for a nice dinner for 4 with drinks was pretty reasonable as well, definitely with the price. I will definitely be back!

I love South Indian food, and prefer it to Northern which tends to be heavier. However, it is harder to find South Indian food in the city, although there is no shortage of such places (joints) in Sunnyvale. That said, Dosa&#39;s is South Indian fare, tasty, delicious. I am no expert on this cuisine, but I know what I like. The dosas themselves are huge and crispy and delicious! Similar to those served at Vik&#39;s (Berkeley), Udupi Palace, but more expensive (I guess you are paying for the nice decor and high rents in SF). The sambars and chutneys were also fantastic. They also know how to market well. They have prepared a separate menu for picky eaters, dividing the foods into columns--vegetarian, vegan, gluten free, etc. Overall, a great place, but I&#39;d rather go to a less expensive place for the same food. I am not much for paying for atmosphere, unless I have to.

Brunch was the best! We had appetizers, dosa, and thalis. Everything was so flavorful - almost exotic. The manager spent a lot of time with us, explaining all of the foods and how to eat the thali. I have been to many Indian restaurants, and no one has ever spent the time with me to explain the menu is such detail. The restaurant was beautiful and was light and airy. By the time we left, it was full. The service was outstanding, and the prices were reasonable. I will definitely return for dinner. This is the best Indian food I have had in the Bay Area. I highly recommend Dosa.

IMHO the best Indian food in SF. Its South Indian so for an Indian like me its hard to compare this against your generic North Indian restaurant. But if I had to choose, Dosa trumps the competition.The food is flavorful, clean tasting and true to its roots. You will find South Indian standards here beyond the eponymous Dosa that you would be hard pressed to find in most cities anywhere in the US. You can tell that the ingredients are fresh and carefully chosen. The service is good and the ambiance is pleasant.Not much more you can ask for. Go and try for yourself

Rating for the bar: came to bar before our dinner reservation at a different restaurant. 4 people, 2-3 drinks each, and an app...I highlight to show we spent money and weren&#39;t just taking up seats. I ordered one drink that I really disliked. I asked bartender if I could exchange it as I wasn&#39;t a fan. His response? In a very disgusted tone &#34;did you read the ingredients before you ordered it??&#34; What type of question is that? Of course I did! Every drink you make is custom for the restaurant. How could I have ordered it without reading it first! It is this type of attitude that makes me not want to visit again as there are so many great places.In the end, he did replace it. But we definitely left on a sour note (given how much I like this place!)

AUTHENTIC AND GOURMET: Sometimes to find authentic cuisine, you have to sacrifice atmosphere and go to hole in the wall. But at Dosa, they manage to serve delicious, authentic South Indian food in a top-rate upscale environment! The food, service, atmosphere, are all excellent. Also, they try to use organic and local ingredients where possible.INSIDE: I prefer this to the other Dosa location. Located in a smaller space, it&#39;s a little more intimate feeling. The tables are spaced close together, but that can be forgiven.FOOD: Free papadum appetizer - order the chutney sampler to make it more interesting. The masala dosa is a staple and a must try. They have a number of small plates, like &#34;north and south samosas,&#34; as well as great entrees like mango prawns. At lunch, try the Thali for a sampling of different items (although some of the offerings are an acquired taste). Check out the drink list for elaborate and pricey cocktails. They now offer interesting egg dishes for brunch. I recommend going family style, and having a feast!

Dosa does not have that err..&#34;authentic&#34; feel when you walk in and I&#39;m ok with that because this restaurant is legit. We had the chennai chicken, idli sambar and spicy basil dosa--all delicious. Make a reservation and don&#39;t miss out.

Dosa was the best meal i&#39;ve had in quite some time. If you want full-bodied food with flavor and spice, this is your place.First of all that pappadam bread they serve you with dipping sauces is simply out of this world. And they kept bringing it! Seriously, it was so simple but amazing. Flavor, texture, man. So SO good. We also ordered this yogurt sauce to dip it into. Also incredible. I went for the dosa option with sweet peppers and chard. I asked for hot - burn your mouth off hot. Usually at curry restaurants I still need to put hot sauce on supposedly &#34;burn your mouth off&#34; heat levels, but dosa brought it. My mouth was on fire and it was so so good. The mango lassi by my side really kept in handy while bringing the heat down a bit. Not to mention it was delicious. And the flavor, man. So incredible. It was my first time ever experiencing a dosa and my mind was blown.We did have to wait FOREVER with a reservation for our party of three, but man was it worth it. Looking forward to returning without a doubt.

You cannot go wrong with the atmosphere here, it&#39;s really beautiful. It&#39;s a nice place to stop by for a drink after work or with some friends before dinner.Both the service and food are average and the location is heavily over priced. We went later in the evening and most of the lamb and chicken items on the menu were sold out. I don&#39;t think that is the right, if it&#39;s on the menu, it should be available or the customer should be told upfront that certain items aren&#39;t available.What we did order was alright. Nothing special or memorable. I may try it out again earlier in the day/evening to experience the variety offered.

Mmmm who thought that a potatoes on a thin, crepe like wrapping would be so delicious!!I&#39;ve heard amazing things about Dosa and was excited to see what the hype was all about. We made reservations for 5:30 on a Sunday. The place wasn&#39;t poppin&#39; when we got there, but it was definitely crowded when we left.Between three of us, we shared:White truffle dosa - 5 stars- delicious. Comes with three amazing sauces, each unique in flavor.Lentil dumpling - 3 stars - was confused with this dish. It&#39;s a lentil dumpling covered with yogurt and other sauces. I was expecting something else, but this was definitely an interesting dish. The yogurt was cooling, and perfectly offset the spicy flavors of our other appetizer.Grilled calamari - 4 stars - came drenched in a sweet/spicy sauce. Delicious grilled flavor!!Vegetable curry - 4 stars - it was recommended that this be eaten with coconut rice. The rice wasn&#39;t as coconutty as I liked, but I definitely appreciated the variety of vegetables that came immersed in the curry. Taro, cauliflower, potato, carrots... and more. Yum!!Definitely would come back to Dosa, if not to have a meal, then at least to grab a few drinks and share a Dosa with a friend.

My brother has been raving about this place for ages and so last week we were lucky enough to get a last minute reservation for prime time seating. Decor is fancy but not stuffy. It was crowded and therefore a little loud, but it would be a very nice place for a date. We were a little early so we decided to sit at the bar and sip on cocktails until our table was ready. We had the Peony and the Gin &amp; Tonic (with cardamom, yum!). Both were great.Shortly after getting the drinks, we were told our table was ready (a bit ahead of our 7:30pm reservation time). The hostess transferred the tab seamlessly.The tasting menu looked amazing but we opted for appetizers &amp; dosas. Here&#39;s what we ate:Appetizers:Lamb KoftaSamosas &#39;North &amp; South&#39;Dosas:Lamb &#39;Keema&#39;Spicy Mung MasalaEverything was brought out hot &amp; fresh - the lamb kofta was particularly tasty and I ended up sopping up the remaining sauce with my pappadum (they had to bring us 2 baskets, we gobbled them up so quickly). The samosas were also very good, not oily and easily shared.I like my food to have a bit of a kick, so I opted for the spicy mung masala - which was great and perfectly spicy. When my brother was distracted and looking away, I nibbled on his lamb keema and *almost* wished I&#39;d ordered that instead, until I took another bite off my own plate and my taste buds did another jig for joy. We really should have split each dosa in half and shared. Next time.Eat the dosas with your hands for maximum enjoyment. This is probably one of the best South Indian restaurants I&#39;ve eaten at (it&#39;s even better than some of the food that we had in India...shhh!)

Came here for lunch on Friday and it was great. The place was only about 1/3 full so we were seated immediately and and server was attentive to our needs. I ordered the sweet potato dosa and it was delicious. Next time I may not order the same dosa because there are so many variations on their menu that seem appetizing and I&#39;d love to try the other combinations. This was my second time dining here and I will be back =)

Finally making it out to Dosa for a Sunday birthday brunch two weeks back, our group of 10 was promptly seated once our reservation time rolled around, with a handful of our party milling around their bar prior to this.After perusing a fairly extensive brunch menu, we ordered the following to share:* Chennai Chicken ($11) - A different take on what I believe is usually a curry-like dish, Dosa prepares their Chennai chicken as strips of lightly-fried white meat, served up with a yogurt dipping sauce. Great, bold, flavor, with a bit of kick to top things off.* Samosas &#34;North &amp; South&#34; ($9) - More or less your standard samosas, the South was filled with caramelized onions and veggies, while the North was simply filled with spiced potatoes. Despite my love of potatoes, I found the South to be much tastier, with greater flavor. However, when had with the sauces, both were quite tasty.While I ordered the following for myself:* Okra Kolambu ($13) [flic.kr/p/dp67ut] - While I find the texture of okra to be a bit weird (admit it, okra is a tad slimy), this was actually a very tasty dish, mixing up savory and sweet flavors with a hint of spice. While most will probably find this to be a single serving, I easily had enough leftovers for seconds.* Rum with South Indian Monsoon ($6 + ?) - Normally a virgin drink, the ingredients (citrus, mint, ginger, juice, and soda) screamed out for a splash of rum. Two others in the group agreed, and not one of us was disappointed by the delicious cocktail that arrived moments later.With enjoyable food and great service, Dosa is definitely on my to-revisit list. And while their dinner menu is definitely more in the $$$ tier, their brunch options price out to a more affordable $$. The only thing about the menu that raised an eyebrow was the pricing of items: having appetizers priced the same as entrees seemed rather unusual.***Accessibility Info***Venue - A large, spacious, and multi-level restaurant, maneuverability and accessibility should not pose any problems, as long as you remain on the lower level. In fact, I doubt they have any way of getting to the upper level aside from the winding staircase.Bathroom - Large and spacious, just like the venue itself, with all the usual ADA accoutrements.

Favorite indian spot in the city (and i&#39;m indian). Get the Rye Raja for a drink if you like Manhattans. All of the lamb dishes are awesome.Get there early on Fridays and you can usually get a spot at the bar if you&#39;re just going for 2 people.

First, we had a 9:15 reservation and were sat at about 10. Ok, not a great start.Food was good... when it came. The service was GLACIALLY slow. We were sat, then 10 mins for someone to come over. We ordered everything at once since we had been there a while. We had a few pretty simple questions about ingredients, and the server had zero idea what was in any of the dishes.Apps came out before we got wine or even water at the table. We had to ask multiple times about the wine. It was late and the bar was slammed... OK but we got a bottle can you just go snag it yourself? 20 mins for drinks is not acceptable no matter how busy it is. By the time we got started on the first dishes (once we finally got drinks) everything else started coming out all at once and they just dropped dishes all over, barely attempting to bus anything.Like I said food was very good but not worth the mediocre service. I&#39;d like to give it another shot -- maybe I need to go on a Tuesday at like 6 pm when they aren&#39;t busy? Seems like they can&#39;t handle what looked to be a normal busy Saturday night.

What hasn&#39;t been said in the over 1200 reviews already?! I&#39;ll do my best to keep this simple and easy.I came here with a large group of co-workers and Dosa was more than accommodating. Not only did the server introduce herself to the group and offer some fabulous dinner suggestions, she was also quick to offer some great wine pairings. There&#39;s nothing better than being waited on by someone who is both friendly and knowledgeable.A big fan of Indian food I&#39;d somehow never tried dosa before. With the suggestion of the white truffle Dosa I could barely wait to get my dinner! In almost no time at all we were served a number of lovely appetizers. From lamb kebabs to samosas, it was all delicious. Then out came my dosa. WOW! It was massive, it was light and flaky and it was de-double-licious. Just thinking of it right now makes me want to hop on a plane back to the Fillmore and get another plate full. The server had mentioned it was her personal favorite item and boy was that a great anecdote. I can&#39;t wait to come back and eat more. The portion was huge and I shared with with friends.... but it was SO GOOD I&#39;ll probably come next time and eat it all for myself.

How could I have never tried the Spicy Mung Masala (Pesarattu) Dosa? SO SO SO good!! Very different from your usual dosa, since it&#39;s made with mung lentils, but what an amazing flavor! I highly recommend you try this variety if you&#39;ve already had other dosas - better late than never, but clearly I was missing out!

Wow! A little envious of the San Franciscans for having this fantastic restaurant so close in proximity!I love Indian food and since I&#39;ve moved from Washington DC to LA its been hard to find authentic Indian food. All the places in LA are extremely casual and nothing too exciting.Enter, the perfect opportunity to eat some great Indian while in SF! Dosa on Fillmore is Southern Indian. I had never had southern Indian before and it&#39;s different dishes than the Northern Indian but same flavors and perhaps more spicy.We ordered a lot of food - in hindsight, way too much food! We started with the chennai chicken - a glorified and much more flavorful version of the chicken nugget. This nugget had it going on! It was organic (yes organic at an Indian restaurant!) marinated in organic yogurt with cumin and coriander and fried. But they really didn&#39;t taste fried.For entrees we ordered the lamb chops (omg these were good), the chicken biryani and the white truffle dosa (a potato filled crepe). The lamb chops came with a mildy spiced lentil sauce that had a sweetness to it that I loved. The chicken was shredded and tender mixed into basmati rice with caramelized onions, peas and cashews and was tender and amazing! The dosa smelled of white truffles but didn&#39;t really taste like truffles much, which was a bit of a let down.We also got the bhatura - this large puffy bread that reminded me of a donut in the best possible of ways. Yummy!Everything was much spicier than I anticipated. I was really feeling the heat, which I loved, but I know for someone who is spice averse this would be a turn off.I would have loved to try their desserts but I was SO full that there was no chance.The space is big, open and modern. It was very lively on a Wednesday night at 9pm. I Will definitely come back here when I am back in SF!

Love Indian Food but be warned this place is really expensive for cuisine that is supposedly common to the common folk. The food here was just really good and I mean with all aspects. The Na&#39;an is plentiful, fluffy and crispy and damn good. The Curry dishes were just so flavorful mixed with the Basmati rice and Na&#39;an just really is all the way spot on. The only complaint about the food is the cracker they serve as a tasting or a snack is a little salty but who the hell cares? I wouldn&#39;t go here every week but on special occasions and if you&#39;re in the neighborhood I highly recommend stopping in right at the beginning of dinner otherwise plan on making reservations because you&#39;ll be waiting for a bit. Luckily there is a bar available while you wait. They got this on lock for sure and the wait staff and the ambiance are just quality.

My friend invited me to meet her here after work on a Friday evening for drinks in the Fillmore. I arrived seconds before she did around 5:45 and we were seated immediately at the communal table near the bar (we were the first to sit at this giant table).I didn&#39;t read any yelp reviews prior, so I only knew it was going to be Indian food. When I peered at the menu, I was a little bit shocked to see the prices (~$30 for curry). Since it was my first time, I only wanted to test the waters and thankfully my friend didn&#39;t intend on eating a full dinner either. We each got one drink and shared an order of lamb keema dosa, which was super delicious. It was flavorful without being overwhelming, and it didn&#39;t make my stomach hurt like most Indian food did afterwards. Also my friend got the peony gin cocktail, which she swears by. I&#39;m totally getting that next time. I got a virgin drink that had mint and a bunch of stuff in it, reminded me of a mojito.What really blew me away was our waiter. I think he worked at the bar. Even though we didn&#39;t order a whole lot for a typical evening at Dosa, he still was super nice and friendly. He even asked complimented me on my nail polish and asked about who did it. (Um, yeah that would be me... And I just did it to cover up old gel polish I didn&#39;t have time to go get removed). He was so sweet, you swear you were high school BFFs. Thank you! You were so fun!I didn&#39;t end up getting the bill, since my friend was treating me (and wouldn&#39;t let me pitch in), so I don&#39;t know how much we tipped. But for the friendly service and tasty food, despite the cost of the food itself, I would totally return!

Dosa is the place to go for a spicy tummy before drinks. Great location and chill vibe. If you never had a Dosa, the flat crepe looking thing, TRY IT. Make sure to sit by the window so you can people watch while you wait.Please don&#39;t get over zealous and order many items. You will have leftovers that you probably wont eat in the next day.

Really nice and professional service.Otherwise, pretty overpriced and nothing out of the ordinary. I had shrimp curry, which was delicious, but not mind-blowing. It cost $30 (with a mandatory side). I can find equally delicious shrimp curry elsewhere in SF for half the price.I guess the main draw of this restaurant is that it&#39;s convenient (it&#39;s right next to Kabuki).

Everything was so delicious! I especially loved the White Truffle Masala Dosa. It was so lovely, chock full of spiced potato goodness with just enough truffle oil to give it a heavenly aroma and a rich, earthy taste. It was terrific on its own, and also nice with the cilantro-mint chutney. The Uttapam with Paneer and Peas was also really nice. It&#39;s almost like an adult version of grilled cheese I particularly liked it paired with the subtly spiced Channa Bhatura (a chickpea masala dish which is also terrific with its own soft, puffy wheat bread) and Dahl Rice (rice with yogurt and veggies). The rice is a terrific way to cut spice and bring out the flavors of a dish. The cocktails, even my virgin versions, are really nice. I recommend the Peony, it&#39;s a gin-based cocktail with has hibiscus masala nectar, coconut juice, lime and and a hint of chili. Even minus the gin, It&#39;&#39;s delicate and quite refreshing. Dessert was a teensy bit disappointing, but I really appreciated that they had vegan offerings. The service at Dosa is really gracious and the atmosphere is romantic. Both make it great for a date, or in my case, a quite girls night out.

Not that Dosa needs another review. It is sublime. I had the summer tasting menu - corn soup, paneer dosa and vegetable curry. Accompanied by the kickin ginger beer soda and followed by the delicious mango pudding.My only very minor issues was that the tapioca pearls at the bottom of the mango pudding weren&#39;t chewy and soft. I ate them any way and would have licked the glass it came in.Our server was patient, attentive and helpful.I wish we had more people to watch our kids so we could go back this trip.

The night after eating here, I had a dream about eating here.The fact that this incredible restaurant is on the other side of North American is soul-crushingly sad. I honestly am a little choked up thinking about it right now.Picture an envelope of thin wrap-style bread, hiding away an inner core of potato, spices, and veggies. You tear the wrapper off and use it to scoop up some of the steaming middle mash. Then you fold it up, and dip it into a spicy broth, trying hard not to drip as you lift it to your mouth and chew.It&#39;s heaven. It&#39;s sexy, sexy food. There&#39;s something about the handling of the food, the way you create your own perfect bite every time, that just satisfies me so much. I know I won&#39;t be back in San Fran for quite a while, but as soon as I return, I&#39;m going back!

Went here on a Saturday night, party of two with reservations. Seated right away on the second floor and had a very amiable and attentive server. The ambiance was great: beautiful lighting structures, not too loud, and a wonderful crowd of families and people on dates. The food is probably not authentic but I found it to be well-done and very delicious. The kabocha squash small plate was great, not too oily, thoroughly cooked. The lamb dosa was amazing! The crepe was huge and while a bit greasy, it complimented the spicy, herb-y lamb filling nicely. My mouth was on fire (though I do have a low tolerance for spicy) but it was so good I kept eating. It also came with a spicy soup which was flavorful but not overpowering. I found the portions to be generous and barely managed to finish my dessert, which was also great - the cheese balls in a rose water cream (don&#39;t know what it&#39;s called).Overall, would come again on a date and definitely getting the lamb dosa again.

I may be biased as I&#39;m just not a fan of Indian food (although this is Indian food with a fusion twist or something and it is higher quality than what I normally experience). Good spice levels which I enjoyed, although some on my party who can&#39;t handle the spice struggled. But like most of my Indian food experiences, my stomach was not quite right the next day, if you catch my drift

I have gotten several dosas here, and the mixed uttapam dish. One time I had the tasting menu, which ended up being way too much food for me. I ended up taking a whole course home without eating it, but that&#39;s ok! Tasty leftovers!Friendly service as well.

Not that anymore yelp reviews will add to what has been said about Dosa on Fillmore (geez some 800-900 wow). Here is my 2 cents.I made reservations through the yelp site...really easy and dosa got the reservation and we were seated right away. We asked to be seated upstairs on a rainy night and it was just wonderful upstairs. The service for us was stellar: prompt, not overbearing, very helpful and just really nice people. I am talking from the waiter, to the bus boy, the drink waiter they were all just great.I love Indian food as I have spent many a night down on 6th street in new york...Mitali etc ( the hotter the better...bring on the lamb vindaloo).Dosa has wonderful Indian food it varies from what I am used to (as there are so many different regions...India is a big friggin place) but they execute really well and the flavors and textures and the presentation are very nice. Prices are not cheap...but than you are dinning in a very nice place with very nice food and very nice service. This aint no pakistani naan and curry y&#39;all.In essence I would come back in a heart beat. It was really really good!!

The food is consistently excellent. They change their menu seasonally and are very creative with their dishes. I recently discovered they&#39;re open for brunch on the weekend.

Dosa on Fillmore is flashy, vibrant but the food is far away from an experience that the location and everything else promises. The lamb appetizer did not offer any delight and the biryani was served luke-warm. The lassi was too thick. I can go on and on.....For $60/pp this place has to really improve a lot in my opinion. I would any day prefer Amber, Sakoon over Dosa.Will I come again? MaybeExpect to pay: $60/pp with no alcohol

4.5 starsNow this is yelp, the thank you economy, and pure customer service done right. The owner reached out to me regarding my A-OK review and welcomed me to come back and try a few appetizers on him. I literally live 4 blocks away so my roommates and I stopped by here on Tuesday night for dinner.Their dinner offerings were excellent. All the items provide very generous servings and they definitely kicked up the spice a notch with these dishes. We got the following:Chaat -- Mangos in chaat? Who would have thought. Apparently this is a South Indian norm to put fruit in chaat and I don&#39;t know why us Northerners haven&#39;t picked up on how good that is.Dahi Vada -- Amazing presentation and great taste. They really know how to take Indian street food and make it classyPakora -- To be fair, I&#39;m not a fan of these generally so I have a bit of a bias against this dish. Clever take on the chutneys mimicking ketchup and mustard.Paper Masala Dosa -- Solid traditional dosa dish. Ask for extra of the orange chutney. Nom.Basil Dosa -- 3/4 of us are Indian and have grown up with all this goodness. This dosa made all of us take a step back and admire how they made this. It&#39;s like pesto meets masala. Very good.Channa Batura -- Seriously, the batura was bigger than my head. INSANE. The channa was excellent. The batura was definitely a little oily for my liking but that tends to happen when its deep fried.Needless to say, I definitely had my mind changed and cannot wait to make this a neighborhood regular. Cheers to your restaurant, Anjan.

Dosa is great and offers southern rather then northern Indian cuisine which seems much more common in the US, the flavors are complex and the food really comes to life, the drinks are great and the service is right on par with everything else here; I recommend Dosa!Order the Papadum with Chutney sampler as it is the best I&#39;ve had and Chennai Chicken is delicious as well.

My family really wanted a good Indian meal, and were excited at the prospect of dosas. Upon arriving we realized it wasn&#39;t a traditional Indian restaurant but more of a cookie cutter establishment trying to be &#34;fancy&#34;...our waitress had never heard of chapati. The menu took inspiration from traditional meals and added some interesting flavors to the dosas such as truffle oil. The end result was bland, heavy, and overall disappointing.If a traditional Indian restaurant is what you&#39;re looking for don&#39;t go here.

Had an absolutely fantastic meal at Dosa. We&#39;re used to eating at hole in the wall Indian restaurants with Bollywood videos playing - Dosa was so gorgeous and posh, it looked more like a club.Came here after a show, about an hour before they were closing, so we were nervous about the food lacking quality. We were incredibly wrong.Our waiter was awesome, he explained his favorite menu items, the rice or dosa that paired well, as well as wine that would compliment. We ordered the north &amp; south samosas, duck vindaloo, and the roasted chile and garlic dosa. We were warned both were extremely spicy, and they weren&#39;t wrong. I can handle heat extremely well but that didn&#39;t stop me from drinking half a dozen glasses of water (which they refilled diligently, thanks guys!). Even the tomato chutney packed a little punch.All entirely worth it, the food was of extremely high quality. The duck was tender, the dosa was perfect crispy, and they brought us about 6 different chutneys for everything. The tomato chutney and cilantro chutney were delicious.Definitely will be back, would love to try the desserts with wine pairings.Also yay for complimentary chips!

Awesome Indian food...what else can I say?The ambiance is perfect for a date or an intimate get together. The noise level isn&#39;t too quiet but it&#39;s not loud like a bar either...perfect loungy atmosphere.Ordered three dishes and shared them family style: chicken biryani, some lamb kofta and mango prawns. All were amazing. Coconut rice to go with the dishes and bhatura which I didn&#39;t know about but was an amazing bread dish. Drank a mango lassi and some type of beer/cider to wash it down. Ended on a perfect note with a dark chocolate cake.Most Indian places are either 1. hole in the wall and good, 2. shady and gross, 3. a street cart or 4. Naan and Curry. It was nice to see an upscale Indian restaurant for a change (kind of like Typhoon in San Diego but even nicer). Definitely better than Gaylord.The prices are a little on the higher side but you are paying for the ambiance. I think the quality of the food is also better but only marginally than some other good hole in the wall places (I&#39;m thinking Chutneys here). Probably wouldn&#39;t come back regularly but definitely if I&#39;m in the mood for some good Indian food and don&#39;t wanna make it down to the Tenderloin, will probably hit it up here.

I mentioned I went to Dosa to a friend, and he smiled. Good food but it&#39;s not authentic. I don&#39;t know if I really care that much. But yeah, the dosa with truffle oil is probably not an ancient recipe.Our threesome ordered from the tasting menu, ordered different things and shared family-style. Everything was delicious, especially the aforementioned truffled dosa as well as the lamb curry. A couple of us ordered the wine pairing. Because the flavors in the food were so bold, the wines did not stand out or bring anything new in the pairing.The decor of the room is gorgeous and our waitstaff was friendly and attentive.

Love every thing that they serve here including the cocktails. The Rye Rajah is my favourite.The Sambar is truly the best you will have in the Bay Area.And the Ras Malai!! uufff... to die for....The only con is that the place is pricey for Indian food, but once in a while one can surely afford it...

A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!! I went for the first time on a Sunday night with a large group; we had a reservation, they were a little slow on seating us but we just had drinks at the bar and enjoyed the ambiance. Once seated the service was fabulous! Our server was very helpful in helping us order, we went family style (which I recommend to everyone so you can try a variety) and every item we had was fabulous. Recommendations: Boti Kebab Dosa is a must (my personal favorite), the minced chicken samosa, kale pakora, chile &amp; mint brazino, Pondicherry mustard prawns, uttapam-get the mixed mushroom truffle oil...I&#39;m sure everything else is delicious, I can&#39;t wait to go back!

I went to Dosa last week with my boyfriend and it was very disappointing. Admittedly, I have been there twice before and had a great experience, but this time that was not the case. I had made a reservation for 7pm, but when we got there the hostess said that our table wasn&#39;t ready and that we would have to wait &#34;a few minutes&#34;. Twenty minutes later, they finally seated us.We ordered a few things, and the waiter was initially helpful in telling us which items had cilantro in them, since my boyfriend can&#39;t eat cilantro. However, he neglected mention that the side of rice we had ordered had cilantro in it, so when it arrived my boyfriend couldn&#39;t eat it. Also, my boyfriend ordered an appetizer that never arrived and was not on our check. Other than that, the food was delicious, and the drinks were fantastic. I got the channa batura and my boyfriend ordered the mulligatawny chicken. We shared an egg dosa, which was surprisingly good (I was a bit skeptical about the eggs).Then the bill came and the total was over $90, so our damage was over $100 with tip. I know this place is expensive, and the food is really great, but for that much money I expect stellar service, which we did not have. I give them four stars for food but two for service. I can only hope that it will be better next time-- if we go here again.

This place was hyped up to me and while it was good, it was not outstanding. As Yelp would say &#34;it&#39;s OK, not A-OK&#34;. Let&#39;s go through it point by point.THE ROOM - Beautifully decorated but there are so many tables jammed together, it&#39;s extremely loud and there is very little chance for privacy. 3 StarsTHE SERVICE - Nice folks but very haphazard, long stretches of no service, then four different people in under two minutes asking us if we were done and could clear our plates. They also screwed up the bill and double charged us. 2 Stars.THE DRINKS - All three of the &#34;Spice Route Cocktails&#34; were hits. We tried the King Louie, Wry Rajah and Lucky 7, excellent. They also have solid beer &amp; wine choices! 4 StarsTHE FOOD - A little disappointing, everything was mild (even the &#34;extremely spicy&#34; dishes). We tried, the CHUTNEY SAMPLER (great), DAHI VADA (best dish of the night), CHILE-CILANTRO FISH (disappointingly bland), PRAWN MASALA (great sauce, rubbery prawns), DUCK VINDALOO (the waiter said it was the spiciest dish in the house, it was not, at all), TAMIL LAMB (good but the flavors didn&#39;t pop). For dessert we shared the RASMALAI (pretty good). 3 StarsOVERALL - A low 3 Stars. Great looking room &amp; cocktails. Decent but not amazing Food but inconsistent service. DOSA still seems to be a big favorite in town and I am willing to give it another shot as I still have to try their actual &#34;dosas&#34; and see how they are but it didn&#39;t blow me away.

This is my FAVORITE Indian place of all time! I am a huge fan of dosas!Had the Paneer and Peas dosa, Uttapam sampler, and Spicy Basil dosa.A dosa is kind of like a thin crepe filled with delicious goodness. My favorite is the Spicy Basil, and I&#39;ve eaten it two days in a row. I love the sauces that come with the entrees, and dosas feel a lot lighter than your typical Indian food (e.g. butter chicken, lamb vindaloo, etc).

Going by Yelp&#39;s star annotations, we definitely had an &#34;A-OK&#34; experience. My boyfriend and I got the samosas, the paneer and peas dosa and the uttapam sampler. The menu went a little overboard on how sustainable, seasonal or organic something was, and they even sell &#39;house purified&#39; water for like $5/750mL. I&#39;m sorry, but that&#39;s ridiculous.The samosas were good, one northern and one southern style samosa come per order - but the most interesting part of the dish was the tamarind sauce and chutney.The dosa had 95% paneer, and a few little fresh peas dotted throughout. The accompanying coconut, tomato and sambar dipping sauces were fine. A little bland upon bland, then you hit the through-the-roof hot sambar, and nothing seemed very balanced.We asked our waiter (who liked pointing at us with two index fingers kind of like the Fonz) what the different uttapams were in the sampler, because one with onions was actually really delicious, and he was like &#39;well, I couldn&#39;t tell ya&#39;. After a few minutes he was like &#39;oh, it&#39;s probably the green onion one.&#39; Gotcha.This was our second time here, and that&#39;ll probably be it for us. Uddupi palace is way more up our alley - intimate and more sincere, none of the thick pretense floating around Dosa on Fillmore and definitely no Fonz-finger-pointing.

This restaurant is a high-quality establishment offering top-notch indian food in a very unique setting. I love the idea of communal tables in a restaurant. My fiancee and I had the pleasure of being seated at these tables and making a solid connection with a woman on a business trip who lived in the same area back home. We ordered and shared food and life experiences over the course of our stay at Dosa on Fillmore, which was definitely a highlight of our trip.We enjoyed selections from the drink, appetizer, dinner, and dessert menu, all of which were highly delightful. Sweet potato dosas, kale pekora, coconut custard, oh my. I would return to SF for the sole purpose of eating at this restaurant.

Dosa has brought indian food to a whole new level for me. Although I heard great things about the restaurants from many of my friends (many of them that grew up with authentic Indian food), the elegance of the restaurant, the attentive servers, and quality and plating of the food far exceeded my expectations.I had their summer seasonal tasting menu, which consisted of 3 courses from a pre-set menu for $39. Each course is a half-sized portion of the original, and thoroughly satisfying. With recommendations from the server (since I&#39;m a wimp when it comes to spicy food), I had the watermelon salad (mild), the trumpet mushroom uttapam (mild), and the chicken eggplant (mild/medium).Everything was delicious, the mushroom uttapam was definitely my favorite - my boyfriend also liked it even though he hates mushrooms (strangely); the chicken in the chicken eggplant curry was extremely tender.My boyfriend ordered the tamil lamb, which was also extremely tender (medium spicy) and yummy. It was a bit too spicy for me though.Some side notes:- They have preset levels of spiciness in their dishes- Make sure to call ahead and make a reservation, it was pretty busy the night I went- Their chai tea has free refills- There is ample street parking around the area

My favorite indian restaurant in the city. Conveniently located three blocks from my new pad in Pac Heights, I&#39;ve become a regular. I came here for a dinner meeting and was able to kick it at the bar with a friend while we waited on our party.The service was great, and the girl to guy ratio was unbelievable. There were literally 15 girls at the bar and then my friend and I. Ow Ow. They seamlessly transferred over our tab to the table which usually comes with an eye roll, however they were extremely polite.We must have ordered seven appetizers to share and they were incredible. Forgive me for not remember the names of everything, but whatever item was bread filled with potatoes was insane. If someone could drop me a line if they remember what it was called I will update my review!

I don&#39;t think I have ever seen a more extravagant Indian restaurant. Decorations-wise, this place was beautiful. I think I was more interested in looking around at the intricacy of the decor than I was in actually eating my food.I came here for a casual dinner, so I ended up spending much more than I had planned. We ordered a bunch of plates for sharing amongst the group, as well as individual meals. I ordered the masala dosa where the dosa was made out of wheat, and was so displeased. It was pretty much impossible to eat because it was crunchy instead of your typical dosa which is foldable. How am I supposed to eat the masala?! I struggled and struggled with my dosa until I finally just left it up for grabs for everyone else while I worked on the other dishes.The watermelon, sprouts, and paneer salad was probably among the most innovative dishes I&#39;ve ever seen. I had seconds and thirds (and fourths) and I didn&#39;t even feel guilty bc it was just watermelon and sprouts. The chennai chicken is to die for but I was dunzo after eating maybe 2 pieces because that shit looks 3x deep-fried. Greasy af but it definitely should be tried on a cheat day. There was one other dish, some kind of shrimp curry, that I also recommend. The main courses themselves (as for me, I only had the unmanageable dosa) were nothing to rave about, in my honest opinion.Overall, love the ambience. Food was good, but not THAT great especially for what I paid. 4 stars felt a little too generous, but don&#39;t let that stray you away. If you&#39;re feeling rich one night and feel like getting some Indian, definitely try out this place. If you are ballin on a budget, maybe go somewhere else I mean Naan n curry is poppin too ahah

I have enjoyed many Northern Indian dishes and have thought that Indian food is certainly one of my great favorites that I constantly seek out wherever I travel. Until I found Dosa I thought I had experienced Indian food. I had only experienced half of what the sub continent has to offer.Dosa is Southern Indian and although some of the spices are very similar to Northern Indian cuisine, the whole experience is quite different and, I have to say, refreshingly so.Everything we had was awesome, so much so that we both overindulged.Starting with their papadum and chutney sampler, we knew we were in for a treat. We actually accepted the very kind offer for more papadums just to keep sampling the chutneys and when the waiter wanted to clear them away we asked for them to stay throughout the meal.The actual dosas are so enormous that we opted for 2 of their smaller sibling called poori not wanting to fill up on bread. Next time we will get a dosa but hopefully we will have others to share it with. They really are enormous.We had prawn masala, Tamil lamb, and lamb chops because we couldn&#39;t get enough of the lamb which was really tender and juicy with incredible spices. Another interesting dish was the dahi rice which is more the equivalent of raita in the north and not really a rice dish per se. Necessary though as a cooling dish to compliment the spices. Without a dosa one really needs a rice dish so we opted for basmati just because all the dishes had so much really tasty sauce which we could not send back.The drink menu eat Dosa is extensive and I was very happy to find a selection of wines that compliment the food really well. A bottle of Saarstein Riesling did not disappoint. Initially I thought that it may be too sweet, although advertised as off dry, but as the dinner progressed and the spices built, it turned out to be another perfect cooling element.Our server, Mike, was excellent and thoroughly understood our tastes. He suggested the lamb chops when we ordered an extra dish late in the dinner, and it was a perfect addition.Looking forward to our next visit to Dosa when we will definitely get one even if it requires a doggie bag!

King of Indian cuisine. I had no idea what a dosa was before this, but my boyfriend took me here because of great reviews from his Indian friend and Yelp. Best things were the Dahi vada and white truffle masala dosa (yes the white truffle makes the difference). OMG honestly an Indian foodgasm in your mouth - as it completely changes your perception of what Indian food should be.

I decided to take my family here for dinner as it had so many great reviews.Pros:-beautiful decor which gives the restaurant a very elegant feel-good serviceCons:-Dosa&#39;s were really bland and we were really disappointed as this was one of the worst dosa&#39;s we&#39;ve ever had. The chutney was so-so and sambar was the best part of the meal.-$13/dosa. seriously?Here&#39;s the bottom line- If you&#39;re Indian or know what good, tasty Indian food tastes like, you&#39;re really going to be disappointed by this restaurant. We had the paneer &amp; peas, white truffle masala, spicy basil and rava sada dosa&#39;s. The names sounded extravagant and tasty but definitely did not live up to it. Don&#39;t get me wrong, the restaurant is nice but if you&#39;re looking to eat delicious Indian food, hit up an actual Indian restaurant that serves authentic Indian food.

South Indian food is pretty much the only kind of Indian food I can tolerate at times. I had Indian food for both lunch and dinner (not by choice) the night before I tried Dosa on Fillmore, on this night I found myself attacking my idlli with glee (not ghee). It&#39;s just such a different experience from typical Punjabi food and nowhere nearly as oppressive with rich sauces and butter. Most dishes start out at a moderately high (for American taste buds) spice level that can only be increased so that it reaches &#34;gun powder&#34; status (ie, perfect for *my* American taste buds). Not spicy enough (you cray cray?), they&#39;ll gladly provide you with ways to get your mouth on fire, ie coconut chutneys (different from the kind you&#39;re used to).Dosai is typically vegetarian (vegan in traditional places), but our server informed us that protein-heavy dishes could be found in the small plates. In addition to the idlli, I ordered the veggie sliders, which were tasty but I removed the rather pedestrian bread from the patty (?- too loose to call it that), which didn&#39;t leave me with much. I also wasn&#39;t in love with the rasam (soup) which I&#39;m used to being much, much spicier. I do recommend the idlli with sambal. I unfortunately didn&#39;t get to try a dosa.What I do appreciate about DOF is that it&#39;s aesthetically nothing like my regular dosa haunt on Long Island, which has a dreary interior that I will gladly suffer because I just love the food so much. DOF has a sumptuous ambiance that lends itself well to both large groups and more intimate dinners as well.*Do* take advantage that this isn&#39;t the most authentic Indian restaurant and order a craft cocktail. I sampled enough of them to be able to say they are good at these. What? I&#39;m all about taking advantage of situations.Although I typically avoid desserts because I can&#39;t enjoy it on a full stomach, I tasted a variety of what they have to offer and I&#39;m afraid I can&#39;t recommend any of them (especially the coconut custard). No big deal. I doubt I&#39;ve ever had an Indian dessert that I liked.

Lost it&#39;s touch a bit. Not with the food, the food is amazing, but with the service. Felt under appreciated. Not enough hosts, had to wait for a table in a nearly empty restaurant. Then was sat next to waiter station and felt like I was having dinner with the wait staff&#39;s butts all night and was not clear person who exactly was our waiter. The women&#39;s bathroom even at 6:00pm was running out of toilet paper and was quite messy. I love this place, love the food, just for this one night it was a bad vibe to spend 100&#39;s of dollars. Advice, consider sliding that table away from that station. I would have said all this to the waiter at the end of the night rather than writing this review but no one asked us how was everything, or how was the food.

MehI don&#39;t know many authentic Indian places that don&#39;t serve Naan let alone Chicken Tikka Masala. I guess I&#39;m&#34;m a bit old fashioned.Overall this place is very Fancy Shmancy. Nothing wrong with that though, It would be fun for a great night out with your Boo. But me and mine were not quite looking for that. We did however love the samosas, and the bread that came with the dipping sauces. One of them was like a soup and that is exactly how we ate it. I must say that soup/dipping sauce was the best part.

The ONLY thing good about this restaurant are the decor and chandeliers inside. I can&#39;t believe how much we paid per person for their pre-fixe menu in our large group - $80 per person!?! Most of us walked away feeling disappointed and ripped off. Not a good dining experience at all. We tried to give it a chance but we kept trying to pass off our dishes to someone in our party that would eat it for us.I love Indian food, but this was so incredibly overpriced for what it&#39;s worth. I&#39;m not expecting super cheap food because you do get what you pay for sometimes, but at least reasonable. It&#39;s not like they&#39;re serving meat dishes here, it&#39;s mainly vegetarian! I&#39;ve been to nice Indian restaurants but never had this type of experience or had to pay this much.I guess this is the PF Chang version for Indian food? Overpriced &amp; overrated. Hopefully I will never have to go back here again! If I do, it won&#39;t be by choice.

Tuesday night was not my first meal at Dosa on Fillmore. It was my go to place before a movie at the Sundance Kabuki. This time I made the mistake of making a reservation through Open Table. After a polite greeting at the desk the hosts quickly found my reservation, and whisked me and my date up to the stuffy, and dimly lit mezzanine level with its own bar. It didn&#39;t even feel like the same restaurant. It was so dimly lit I could not read the menu. When I asked for an extra candle or a flashlight for more light, the waitress sneered &#34;use your cell phone flashlight app like the other customers&#34;. The advice would have been fine if I had a flashlight app or a cell phone.I would still recommend the food and the drink but only on on the lower level--even sitting at the downstairs bar-- but the very unpleasant and dark mezzanine is where they punish customers who bother to make reservation and punish their workers--forced to descend and climb a steep staircase for every trip to the kitchen. Never eat in a place where its so dark you can&#39;t read the menu or see the food.

The dosa we had was burnt and the service was very slow. We had to wait to one hour due to a mistake the kitchen made to receive our food. Unfortunately the food (uttapam &amp; dosa) were mediocre at best. Based on our experience, I can&#39;t really recommend this place to any fellow southern Indian food fans.

Went here for our anniversary dinner last week, for the first time. Overall, we enjoyed it, and I would probably go back, but with a couple of caveats.The Good: The happy hour appetizers we tried (the kale pakora and vegetarian sliders) were really, really good. And at the $6 happy hour price, no regrets. I enjoyed the sweet potato dosa we got, though my husband was a bit less enthusiastic. The cocktail menu is fascinating. Only tried one--the peony--but it was absolutely delicious--tasted like melted sorbet or something. I usually can&#39;t drink gin anymore, but it didn&#39;t even taste like gin. Dangerous! I&#39;d love to try some of the other special cocktails, but at $12 a pop, you really do have to limit yourself. The restaurant itself is beautiful and spacious. Everything we tried was tasty, though the prices are too high. Our waiter was nice, helpful, attentive. There is a parking garage right next door, and since it&#39;s run by the city, it&#39;s only $1/hour--a good find in the City of No Parking.The Bad: Overpriced. The lamb tamil tasted good, but it was a tiny serving for $26, plus you have to order rice or dosa with it as a side (they don&#39;t really give you the option not to) and that adds an extra $3-5 to that $26 plate. It definitely wasn&#39;t good enough (or substantial enough) to be worth $30. (We get one at a hole-in-the-wall down the street that&#39;s just as good or better for $8.) In fact, everything on the menu is pretty much a la carte and too expensive (besides the happy hour appetizers!). The bartender was really rude. I didn&#39;t feel like he was overly rude to us (though my husband did--I guess he&#39;s more sensitive), just not overly nice either, but he was definitely rude to someone who came and sat down on the other side of us. This person was trying to order something from him as he was making some drinks, and instead of politely telling him something like, &#34;I&#39;ll be right with you,&#34; he snapped, &#34;I&#39;m not ready for that.&#34; With attitude. Even though he didn&#39;t do anything like that to us, the attitude was definitely, &#34;I&#39;m doing you a favor by answering your question or taking your order.&#34; I can do without the attitude. I have been a server/bartender and I know when you&#39;re busy it can be tempting to be short with customers, but it&#39;s unacceptable. I never did it and I don&#39;t expect my servers/bartenders to do it to me. But, like I said, our waiter at our table was great, and the hostesses were fine as well. The happy hour drink menu is only for one beer, two wines and a margarita, all $6 except the beer (which is $4). That is a decent (but not amazing) price for those drinks, but it was disappointing that there wasn&#39;t some kind of discount on their awesome cocktails during happy hour...but fine, whatever. The happy hour food menu sort of makes up for that, I guess.I guess you are paying for the experience as much as the food itself, and we did have a nice evening, but I don&#39;t see it becoming a regular spot for us.

I just finished my leftover Dosa and am currently regretting not having ordered more food for leftovers while I was at the restaurant last night. I had the spicy basil dosa which is apparently the most popular dosa on the menu and rightly so because it tastes fantastic! I was not a fan of their sambhar (seemed to have too much curry powder) but their coconut and tomato chutneys went along really well with the dosa. My hubby got the Uttapam sampler which was also pretty good except for the mushroom uttapam.. the mushrooms were too chunky and they did not go well with the rest of the uttapam. We also had --the Mung salad (which was decent)the squash pakoras (they were alright)the dahi vada (vada was on the dry side even though it was submerged in liquid yogurt and chutneys.. not quite like the fresh home made vadas!)I would definitely go back here, but mainly for the uttapams, dosas and sweet lassi.

Dosa knows how to run a restaurant. Spectacular service and delicious food.My boyfriend and I had a reservation (recommended, it was pretty busy for a Tuesday night) and we were seated immediately. The host gave us a run through of how their menu works and gave us his own recommendations, which was really helpful. Then our server, Megan H, came by and also helped us out with our selections. I was REALLY impressed by how knowledgable she was about the foods. She recommended drinks and answered all of our questions about portion size, flavor, etc. They also give you these chips to start off with, which are SO ADDICTING, and Megan was able to tell me what they were made of. Already obsessed.The food was delicious. We got the scallops and samosa appetizers, which were definitely appetizer-sized portions. Just enough to split between the two of us. We also shared a dosa, which was very good when paired with the chutneys and the tomato-lentil soup that it came with. We also got two of their specialty cocktails, the Ante and the Peony, which were both quite good. Megan recommended their chai-white chocolate gelato (their dessert special that night), which we got, and it was amazing. Hints of chai in a creamy gelato... My boyfriend got their chai tea, which we were not really impressed with. We prefer spicier chais, and their&#39;s is quite mild. But all in all, it was a delicious meal.The appetizers came out pretty quickly, but our dosa took awhile, which we were more than okay with. They kept us occupied with more of those chips. Then suddenly, we were told that since our dosa was taking awhile, it&#39;d be on the house?! I have never had a restaurant take responsibility like that, and was most pleasantly surprised. Especially because I&#39;ve waited longer for food from other restaurants. Dosa cares about the entire experience, not just the food, which was very refreshing. 5 stars, would recommend to a friend, and will definitely be back.

If you were to compare my feelings towards international cuisine to a human relationship, I would say that I&#39;m definitely crushing on Indian food right now. It&#39;s like that cute boy you make eyes with on the bus or at the gym, but never take the time to actually strike up a conversation with. Until now.Per a friend&#39;s suggestion, I ate here last week for a business lunch. Having walked by this restaurant often and hearing great stories, I was definitely looking forward to eating here, even if it meant an extra trip to the city to do so. At noon, it was dead for about 15 minutes or so, then the lunch crowd started rolling in.Service here is exceptionally nice. Very patient, not pushy with the specials or pressuring you to order. Just attentive and ready to help in any way possible. Since I arrived a little early, they let me wait at the bar for my dining companion and even gave me a water.For lunch, my friend and I ordered two different items and split them - just so I could get a taste of Southern Indian food. As others have indicated, definitely order a Dosa. Anyone can eat &#39;em (they&#39;re vegan) and they taste fantastic. Never tasted anything like it. We also had the chicken Frankie and it was delish! A little spicy but nothing too offensive.Since this was a business lunch, all I had to drink was water. But after reading everyone else&#39;s reviews, now I wish I had a cocktail! Next time, my friend, next time. Because I definitely want to continue this budding relationship with a new type of food.

I&#39;ve never really been a huge fan of Indian food in general, but came here with some out of towners for dinner.We came with an Indian guy who seemed to know his food, so we let him handle the order... We had the South Indian Bhel Puri, Channa Bhatura, Tamil Lamb, Chile-Cilantro Fish and some Dosa on the side... Plenty of food for 4.My favorites were the Bhel Puri and Channa Bhatura... The Tamil Lamb was also good (I&#39;m usually turned away from lamb due to gamey-ness), and the Chile Cilantro Fish was tasty... Overall a good mix of different flavors.I&#39;d say this would be a good date night spot for some classy Indian food if you don&#39;t mind dropping a few dollars... Drinks were a bit on the pricey side, but they were good... I&#39;ll probably find my way back here again in the future if I feel like having Indian.

This is the classiest Indian restaurant I&#39;ve been to. On first impression, I loved the interior, amazing lights, and the overall upscale scene. Remember to make a reservation, no matter how big your party! It got really crowded by 7pm on Friday night.Drinks were pretty good. The others enjoyed their cocktails, while my monsoon was interesting at best - I did not like chucks of ginger going up the straw and the taste was too savory for me, not refreshing enough. Our nice waitress gave us advice on how many plates to share amongst the 4 of us. We split 2 appetizers and 3 dosas.- Chennai chicken was delicious as everyone has pointed out. The only meat we had for the meal. Large portion too, great for sharing.- North/south samosas were decent, but not exactly worth the $9 for just two.- Dosas ($12-13) - white truffle, paper masala, and basil - each were humongous and the stuffing in the truffle and basil was not spread out enough. The edges of the dosas were basically just the crepe. As soon as we hit the middle, it tasted amazing though. None of them were bad. Overall table consensus was for the paper masala, enjoyed with the different dipping sauces.Those dishes plus a few rounds of drinks came to about $40 per person with taxes. Not extremely bad for a classy dinner and an adventure trying new things. But for the everyday takeout of tikka masala and rice, go to a more affordable Indian joint.

MAKE A RESERVATION. It&#39;s always a good sign when there is a line, of Indian diners, out the door of an Indian restaurant. The decor of this restaurant was perfect. The atmosphere was exciting and loud. Just like the flavors of the food. The gunpowder scallops were not a good appetizer to split as recommended. The menu was hard to navigate on my own without the help of the waiter...but once we got over that hurdle, the flavors of every course were delish!

I&#39;m no expert on Indian food to be honest but this was really good.The dosas were amazing as well as the lamb kofta. Chicken was also great, really tender and tasty.Love the fact that you can sit at a round table with your friends and share the small platters.Totally recommend this place for everyone who wants to try out Indian food. Friendly and patient personnel that have great tips especially if it comes to spices. I&#39;ll definitely check out this place soon again.

I love the food. I always seem to eat too much. The dosa pancake is a big hit amongst my family members. But boy is the food salty. So salty. I am soaking up water all night and all next day. My face is puffy too.The duck vindaloo was quite dry, not living up to the expectations. The prawn masala was delicious and definitely my favorite. My father favors the lamb curry.The food is very salty. If it wasn&#39;t so salty, it&#39;d be much more delicious.

I wasn&#39;t sure what to expect when I was told this was unusual Indian cuisine. Not your normal sauce and rice with nana bread - they don&#39;t even do naan here. What they do is Indian specialty. Indian interesting.The name of the restaurant comes from their signature dish. A dosa, it turns out, it like an Indian crepe - with everything packed into the shell. And it&#39;s ... amazing.They recommend that you share plates with everyone you&#39;re here, from the dosa on down. There are a bunch of little places, bigger plates, dosas and more. We ordered a ton! Things that stood out to me were the basic masala dosa (mmm), the sauced scallops, and the lamb balls. But seriously, everything on the table blew my mind.It&#39;s delicious; it&#39;s vegetarian and vegan friendly. It&#39;s unlike anything I&#39;ve ever eaten before.The atmosphere is very chic - from the giant metal doors to the abstract art and glass windows. It&#39;s really a giant, fantastic, impressive spot.This is an expensive place. You&#39;re going to drop some bucks to do some dishes here, especially with their amazing selection of alcohol. Still, it&#39;s worth it. Everything put in front of me was fantastic. I ate until my stomach hurt and then I wanted to eat some more.Oh, Dosa, you&#39;re like nothing else and I love it.

Pleasantly surprised to find this place last week. This was my first introduction to dosa, which is a type of savory Indian crepe. I ordered the spicy basil dosa, which was basically a gigantic, crispy triangle. It was pretty delicious on its own but the side sauces were key; they let you experiment throughout the meal and balance the spiciness to your liking. I also ordered the lamb meatballs, which were a bit expensive for what they were.Luckily, we got there right before the main crowd and were able to secure half of the large communal table in the front after waiting at the bar, which was also a step up from most Indian restaurants. Another difference I noticed: very few if any Indian people actually work here. Make of that what you will, but this is definitely not your classic Indian curry joint, more like a modern interpretation of the usual cuisine.Really cool decor and ambience. I&#39;d go back for sure.

After my first lackluster visit here a while back, I had an excellent meal here last night. The space is beautiful, and it&#39;s quite the Pac Heights hotspot.We started with the Crispy fish pakora, perfectly fried moist fish, and well seasoned. It comes with two dipping sauces, one of which was really spicy, so I loved it.The Chennai chicken was fine, an Indian inspired fried chicken, but in the world of fried chicken, this wasn&#39;t the best. Nice flavors though, and served with a yogurt sauce.The South Indian lamb kofta, meatballs, in a delicious tomato sauce, was really tasty, especially with the lemon rice.We ended with the Roasted chile and garlic masala dosa. NIce and spicy as advertised, and with an even spicier sauce in the trio of sauces served with it.The cocktail menu is quite inventive, the Batsman was really refreshing after a hot day.I love how they don&#39;t hold back on the spice here, so I&#39;ll be back for sure.

I live just down the street from Dosa and I think I might be growing addicted to their food! Or their cocktails! Or the food! Maybe it&#39;s both actually.I always, always, always order a dosa. I know some of you may be shaking your heads at me thinking about all the other goods I&#39;m missing out on from the menu. But, I don&#39;t care for 2 reasons. One, it&#39;s named &#34;Dosa&#34; for crying out loud! Don&#39;t you think this means that its namesake should be the best thing on the menu? I do. And two, Sir Nicholas never orders the dosa, but he always shares so I do get to try the other menu items. And I have to say I haven&#39;t found one I like better than my dosas yet.I&#39;ve tried a wide variety of the types of dosa that&#39;s offered here and I like them all, but my favorite right now might be the green chile because it&#39;s so spicy and delicious. Cocktails are quite nice, too. Again I haven&#39;t had one I would turn down again so you just have to find one made with the type of liquor you most enjoy and order away.For a little tip, Dosa lets you book your Open Table reservations up to pretty much the last minute so before you head out see if there are any soonish reservations open. It&#39;s beats waiting at the host stand for a table any day.

Dosa is ridiculous. Bhatura is probably one of the most memorable things I&#39;ve eaten this year - basically a crazy inflated naan. I&#39;ve never seen anything like it. All the plates we tried were solid. No question it&#39;s pricey, but well worth it.I&#39;d come back.

One of my favorite restaurants in SF! The Fillmore location has a nicer ambiance and more parking options than the Valencia location. It&#39;s a great date restaurant, especially because the movie theater is right across the street. The menu is a little pricey for Indian food, but well worth it. We come here about twice a month for dinner. Some of our favorites are:- Vada Pav **Get this. You won&#39;t regret it**- Masala Dosa- White Truffle Dosa (my bf thinks it&#39;s heavy, but I love it)- BhaturaMy favorite chutney is their coconut chutney. I don&#39;t even like coconut, but the flavor is not overwhelming at all.

I have been wanting to try Dosa at either location for a long time. I love Southern Indian food, but most Indian restaurants feature food from the north. I was really excited when the gals and I decided to come to the Fillmore location for dinner. With such great company, well, and so many yummy drinks (do try the Bollywood Hills!!), it was hard to pay too much attention to the food, but it was mostly good! The staff could use some work, though.We had decided early to order the tasting menu, so I didn&#39;t even look at the regular menu. The three of us each ordered something different and we all tried each others&#39; dishes--the best way to go, IMO. When I asked a question about one of the dishes I was ordering, the server gently informed me that a description was in the menu under that section. Um. OK. I didn&#39;t read it, so can ya just tell me? Also, he described the masala dosa as filled with eggplant, not potato. So when I got it I thought I had the wrong dish. Which wouldn&#39;t have been surprising since multiple servers tried giving us another table&#39;s food three different times. We even got entrees delivered to our table after we had dessert! There was some serious disorganization going on.All of our dishes were very good, but my fish curry stood out to me as very good. I thought it was incredibly overpriced, but will try going again and ordering off of the regular menu.I should also mention that the restaurant itself is beautiful.

This is our favorite place to take out of town guests. I love this place. Must try the paper dosa with all the great chutneys. There is also an amazing chicken dish, the chennani chicken which is a little like spicy fried chicken. We&#39;ve had most of everything else as I love to try new things, and everything was worth it. Be sure to make a reservation.

This place has a great ambiance. The decor is beautiful and the atmosphere is lively without being too loud. I came with a reservation, so we were seated shortly after we arrived. That said, the food didn&#39;t quite match my expectations. My date and I ordered the Chennai Chicken, the Green Mango &amp; Paneer Dosa, and the South Indian Moons Uttapam. The chicken was pretty good, albeit spicier than I&#39;d have liked (although I&#39;m a wimp about that). The dosa was alright, but neither my date nor I could taste the mango. In fact, I thought the whole thing was on the bland side, without any flavors that stood out. The uttapam, which came with a variety of different kinds, wasn&#39;t much better. Maybe my taste buds were dying from the spicy chicken, but I was expecting something a bit more memorable.

The quality of food here has gone down from a year or two ago. I went here thrice over the last few months and have always felt really queasy after the meal. Something is fishy with the oil they use.

Waitress was a little awkward, to say the least. I politely asked if I could sub a different booze in one of the house cocktails. Her answer &#34;No!&#34; in a very abrupt, loud voice. Now, having been a waitress, I totally understand that not all bartenders/chefs are okay with subbing, which is why I asked, but I would never have said it that way. It left a bad taste in my mouth, which was exacerbated by the fact that we weren&#39;t asked how our food was until after we were almost done, and the bus boy/food runners did most of the actual checking on us/filling our waters/clearing our plates (they were great by the way, so we slipped the most attentive one extra cash on our way out).Service aside (which had been good the last time we were here), the food was awesome. We had a kale/carrot/cashew salad and lentil patties with an awesome yogurt sauce as appetizers. I had fish moilee, which was white fish (don&#39;t think the menu specified the type), with a really flavorful sauce over curry leaf rice. It was one of the best Indian food dishes I&#39;ve had in a long time. Hubby had duck vindaloo, which was really spicy, but delicious, and the coconut rice was creamy and delicious.Atmosphere is nice - pretty decor, comfortable chairs, etc.The food was definitely 4.5 stars, but I&#39;ve rounded down for service, which was more like a 2/3.

Food= 5 stars!!! Amazing amazing amazing. White truffle Dosa is where it&#39;s at. The Marsala prawns are incredible as well. Bar = 5 stars!! The bartenders are so knowledgeable, fast, and damn - some of the best drinks I&#39;ve ever had. The servers= 2 stars. I&#39;ve been here two weekends in a row and have had the same unfriendly, unwelcoming, and rude service from 2 separate servers. The server we had tonight approached our table, didn&#39;t introduce herself, and the very first thing she said was &#34;what can I get for you?&#34; Not a hi, welcome to dosa, do you have any questions... My name is... Nothing. I asked if she could recommend vegetarian options. She said &#34;everything is vegetarian except this and this&#34; as she pointed at the menu.... Um I can read, I know what vegetarian is. I asked her again to recommend something. She quickly lists a few things, obviously irritated. Last weekend, same thing. Our server never introduced herself, didn&#39;t review anything on the menu and was very mechanical. When you&#39;re serving fine dinning and especially with a genre of food that is a little off the grid.... Help a sista out!! Love the food love the drinks so I think I&#39;ll eat at the bar from here forward. They are true professionals

Maybe I am biased but I have always felt strongly that Asian and Indian food should not be priced like fine dining experiences except on rare occasions. Especially when it comes to Indian food, I am especially more biased because most of the ingredients are economical to attain and are very basic. Dosa has mediocre food that is presented in a very elegant manner. If that&#39;s what you pay a premium for I rather go a couple blocks down for India Palace buffet.The chicken appetizer was overly spicy and small. The best thing was the dosa paper masala which is like a think crisp Indian pancake you dip in curry and coconut sauce. I can see why its unique and on the 7x7 list but if that&#39;s the best thing they have to offer (pan-fried dough) then that might be a little bit of a problem.The wait was long even though we made reservations and service is mediocre as they forgot one of our dishes. To leave on a positive note, the construction of this restaurant is gorgeous. Great bar and loft overlooking the venue. This place would make a great night lfe venue.

Great ambiance, high end establishment. I recommend trying the Sweet potato dosa, its unique, delicious and not too spicy. Monsoon madness beverage was refreshing but had more ice than I would have liked. Service was decent, however the waiters changed from the beginning to end of our meal.Even though I was wearing tennis shoes the floor was slippery where we were seated. Due to cozy distance between other tables whenever waiters passed by they kept tucking in so we are closest to the table, like we are little kids;)

This is the best Dosa place I have been to in US and in ages to be frank. This is the pure South Indian cuisine restaurant I have visited in a long time. The ambience of the place is good.I went there with my family and oh boy I felt that I made the right decision. We ordered Rawa Masala Dosa, Vada Sambar, Masala Dosa and Uttapam. The dosas were crisp and well cooked. The quantity of chutney and sambar was also good. I always wanted to have a good Rawa Masala dosa and I am happy to find this place after 2.5 years of stay in US on my maiden trip to SF. I would definitely recommend this place. They have a good variety of Dosa, Uttapam in there menu and hope to visit this place again in near future.

A fun and unique twist on traditional south indian cuisine with a variety of tasty dosas. I think the authenticity of the food is probably mediocre at best by indian standards and you&#39;re paying more for the ambience because dosas, though tasty, are traditionally served in smaller cafes or street side in India or in indian neighborhoods across the US. However, I&#39;m a sucker for ambience and didn&#39;t mind this particularly because its a good excuse to bring others to introduce them to south indian cuisine in a cool atmosphere where you can sample dosas in a variety of american and indian flavors. The paper dosa is tasty, though the size might be a bit surprising if you&#39;re unfamiliar with dosas. White truffle masala is also an interesting idea. Overall, a creative and worthwhile eating experience. I wish there were more restaurants doing fusion south indian food.

One of the best South Indian meals I have had to date - and I am South Indian. The food is authentic but with a twist to make it interesting. The flavors are the right balance of heat, spice and sour. We ordered the kale pakoras, rasam, mung dal dosa, garlic and chili dosa and all were excellent. I had a cocktail (can&#39;t remember the name but it had tequila, cucumber and citrus) which was good too. We ordered the white chocolate turmeric pot de creme for dessert and I said I was only going to try a taste because I was full and I ended up eating every last bite. We enjoyed excellent service - granted it was Friday lunchtime so maybe not as busy but there were plenty of customers. All in all a great experience and I plan on a return visit.

Such pretty restaurant filled with so many flavors and spices! Everything, literally EVERYTHING I ordered was a treat for my taste buds.We ordered:- Scallops: Really good and flavorful sauce. It was grilled so had a nice little crisp.- Chicken chennai: 2nd favorite! It was spicy and tender and the sauce they had to accompany it soothed the heat. Even after eating a lot of pieces I never tired of the flavors.- masala dosa: This thing is huge! At first I was skeptical about how it would taste, but it was really crunchy and tasty.- Lamb: #1 favorite! So tender and tasty! I brought it home and ate it for lunch the next day, STILL DELICIOUS. Highly recommend!

So the two stars on this review is only because of the food. I have to note the service was absolutely AMAZING. We were heading to the Kabuki on opening day of Harry Potter (just after work) so we had wanted something close by. When I made the reservation, I was honestly slightly irked that they took my credit card number down (there were six of us), it seemed a little elitist to me but people have raved about this place, I had to give it a shot.The waitress was awesome, she was prompt and the service was so fast. We had told them we were limited on time so she hauled for us. I also thought it was cool that she informed us that gratuity was already included in the bill.So the food, it is definitely pricey. And its not bad at all, but if you&#39;re looking for flavorful, close to authentic Indian food. I feel like Dosa has &#34;americanized&#34; their food and taken out the spices so it loses the authenticity of Indian food. I also didn&#39;t like my paneer &#34;dosa&#34; came as a wrap. I wasn&#39;t expecting that. I&#39;m Indian and when I hear &#34;dosa&#34; I think of the typical Indian dosa. For the price and that flavor, I probably won&#39;t ever go back. Its the bay area, there are a ton of other more authentic Indian places.

Oh, Dosa. You&#39;re opened my eyes to what is possible in a higher-end Indian establishment. Get in my mouth.Your swanky decor and killer service are just the start. Your cocktails? Impeccable. (Although the pisco/rhubarb/black pepper one? I&#39;d skip it. Sounds inspired, but totes weird.) Your food? Delightful. Fantastic. You? Oh, you...I know it sounds like I&#39;m in love. And I&#39;m pretty far in like, to be sure.Dosas = delicious. The green chile garlic dosa? To die for. The OG thing? Good, but that chile garlic... hot dang!Also, not to be forgotten = lamb meatballs, scallops, and the cheese/pea filled dosa. Yum.Having come here for a work dinner, I didn&#39;t end up footing the bill... but I did notice that the price factor would&#39;ve most certainly been a consideration had I been doing so.Get the Buffalo Trace cocktail, the lamb, and the green chile dosa. Freaking set, you will be. Happy in your tummy and your mouth, unequivocally. Yoda speak, unnecessary it is, but hey... sometimes backwards is okay. Or whatever.

I had the truffle dosa and it was delicious! The fusion of Italian and Indian ingredients made my experience super interesting and keeps me wanting to try more on the menu. Oh also, the dosa&#39;s are gluten-free which is convenient.The dim lighting and soft music makes for a romantic evening. The food was great, our server was nice. I will definitely come back!

Food is strictly ok, nothing extra ordinary. There are way better options in South Bay area which offer tasty and authentic food at a better rate.We had chennai chicken, prawns masala and chicken xaccuti and all of them were just about OK. The paratha they serve with curries tasted the same as Kawans frozen paratha that you get at any local store (rather make it at home then have it here). I have had better fresh and tasty parathas at other restaurants.If you are pricing is high then at least see to it that the experience is worth it.Perhaps there are some more traditional items that should be eaten here, but overall I did not find the place worthy enough of the hype.

You would be hard-pressed to find something amiss at Dosa (well, I&#39;m sure there are those out there who could find it...but then, they&#39;re just cranky!).This restaurant has something for everyone! Sexy date-night spot? Check! Fun space for groups? Check! Happy hour with friends? Check! A place to impress out-of-towners? Check!The food is wonderful...not your traditional Indian fare...but oh-so delicious and a perfect way to comfortably ease your non-adventurous food friends into trying something besides meat and potatoes!Everything on the menu is wonderful...a must have is the paper masala dosa. They have the most wonderful, flavorful and rich curries and sauces. They even have some tasty items for the no-meaties in your life.The drinks are wonderful!Yeah, I&#39;m a total fan =)

After driving all day to the lovely city of San Francisco, we were famished. My hope for trying the up and coming State Bird Provisions was immediately dashed as they were fully booked even on a Tuesday evening. Thankfully our local hosts had good alternatives, and as it was nearby we headed over to Dosa who graciously accommodated us last minute.Dosa is gorgeous. It&#39;s a stunning space, the room is expansive and atmospheric with beautifully rendered art that blends old and new. In effect, it&#39;s a representation of the Southern Indian dishes available that are both authentic and modern. The food pleasantly reminded me of Vij&#39;s in Vancouver, the best Indian food I&#39;ve ever had. Anywhere. This isn&#39;t quite at that level, and its not as consistent but then what is? For the most part, the food was jaw-droppingly good, though interestingly my least enjoyable dish was the namesake dosa.Before I forget, the bread is amaaaaazing here. There is no naan (wrong part of the country), but you won&#39;t notice. Bhatura is a must order. It&#39;s a giant, light fluffy piece of edible pastry heaven. Pretty sure I could live off of it. Papadon was equally good, one of the best I&#39;ve come across. Light and lovely. Paratha was also quite nice.Samosas North and South are wonderfully prepared here, perfectly crispy. Bookended with two different but equally divine sauces, especially the sweet one.Lotus Stem Dayboat Scallops were exquisite. Again balanced by two ridiculously addictive sauces, this was my favorite dish of the evening.Rasam Fire Broth was interestingly named, because it wasn&#39;t particularly fiery but it was extremely tasty. It had a moderate kick, but a very good and interesting flavor.Roasted Chili and Garlic Dosa was exceedingly hot. Almost unpleasantly so, but keep in mind I like moderately spicy not hair curling hot, so if you like really spicy it might be wonderful.Mangalorean Prawn Masala was nicely prepared. Great flavor, nice balanced spice. Quite enjoyable.Duck Vindaloo was very good.Sun Choke Uttapam wasn&#39;t that successful for my palate, possibly it was the version we chose, but I don&#39;t think I&#39;d visit that dish again.Surprisingly we ended with a fantastic dessert. Pistachio Dacquoise with chocolate chili mousse, salted caramel and cocoa cookie. If that sounds good on paper, it was even better on the tongue.Overall, this was a delightful beginning to our trip. There&#39;s nothing like a complete lack of expectation to allow for immense pleasure, and since we knew nothing beforehand, every great moment was enhanced. Had it not been for the two missteps, this would have been an easy five star night for us. In fact, even with them it really still was for me.Best Plates: Day Boat Scallops, Rasam Fire Broth, Samosas, prawn Masala, Duck Vindaloo, Bhatura, Dosa, Pistachio Dacquoise with Chocolate Chili MoussePalate: moderately exoticFood - A-Ambience - A+Service - A-Value - A-

Coolest indian restaurant in SF.Really really awesome ambience (a lot nicer than their valencia st branch) + pretty good food too (same menu as the valencia st branch).Previous to this, the most ambient indian restaurant award went to Amber (the sf one), but the food there was pretty sad, so I am glad this place could take that honor away.Had vada pavs, which were pretty good, and my friend had a standard masala dosa which he seemed to like a lot.They have a pretty awesome bar as well!Great decor, service and food.. need to come here more often!

UNREAL. Maybe one of the best dining experiences I&#39;ve had. The cocktails are amazing. Some of the best I&#39;ve had. The Peony was the best gin drink I&#39;ve had. The Hideaway was a great spicy cocktail Seeing the mezcal mist was pretty cool. The food is fantastic, not your traditional Indian food. Our waiter was patient and helpful guiding us through. We tried many of the small plates and also the White Truffle Dosa, which was good, but I&#39;d stick strictly to small plates next time. I will defintely be back.

The food here is fantastic! I love Indian food and the dishes here are very well done. The dishes I tasted were:APPETIZER:The North and South Samosas: savory pastries filled with caramelized onions and vegetables (South) and spiced potatoes (North). These were very good. The pastry was lightly crisp and the filling was hot and flavorful. I liked the Southern samosa more. The dipping sauces they come with complement the samosas very well.Dahi Vada: Lentil dumplings topped with cool Straus organic yogurt, piped with tamarind and mint, mildly spiced. Freaking delicious! The presentation is very eye catching as well and matches the amazingness of this dish. All the flavors just work so well together. Yum! You absolutely must try this.ENTREE:Prawn Masala with coconut rice: reduction of coconut milk, red chiles, ginger, red onions &amp; spices. Delicious! This is a curry entree and I love curry. The medley of spices really enhanced the flavor of the prawns but none of the flavors were overwhelming each other. You can definitely taste the heat in this dish. I&#39;d describe it as medium spicy. When you order any of the curry dishes, they don&#39;t ask you how spicy you want your food. So if you don&#39;t like spicy, make it clear to the server how hot you want your curry when you order. The whole table ordered curry dishes and they were all on the medium spicy side.DOSA (ENTREE):Paper Masala Dosa: This is basically a crispy crepe served with spiced Indian potatoes, onions, and cashews. This is an entree sized dish but the whole table split it. The dosa is absolutely massive. Think of a size of a log. The dosa was perfectly crisp and not at all oily.Masala Chutney Dosa: Classic masala dosa spread with spiced chutney of blended baby eggplant. I don&#39;t have much to say on this dish. It was just okay for me. Slightly too salty.DESSERT:Dark Chocolate Cake: topped with creme brulee, over 3-spice creme anglaise. All their desserts have an Indian flair with spices to enhance the flavors. The chocolate cake was pretty good. One of the spices is star of anise. Unfortunately, I found that out the hard way. They garnished the dish with a whole clove and I ate it thinking it was chocolate! Ick! Not pleasant. It&#39;s like eating a piece of licorice flavored wood. If you order this, don&#39;t pop the star shaped object into your mouth because I had to spit it back out. The star of anise is found in chunks in your cake. I think the cake would&#39;ve tasted much better if it were infused in powder form. It just didn&#39;t work as well for me because of the textural difference and feeling random bits of spice stuck on my tongue. Aside from that, everything else was good.I&#39;d recommend coming here if you&#39;re looking for a more upscale Indian restaurant. Good for a date night or catching up with friends. The ambiance is very trendy. Think dim lighting, cocktails, beautiful people, elegant Indian decor with a lot of soft browns and gold, and plush leather chairs. The chairs were soooo comfortable. You just sink right in and you won&#39;t want to get back up. The service is okay. Our water glasses were constantly filled. The food takes awhile to come out so have some patience. The bathrooms were also clean. As far as pricing goes, I felt that it was reasonable for the quality of the food and the area. Definitely check this out if you&#39;re looking for a fine dining experience around Japantown.

This is Indian Food for Americans at its best/worst. Absolutely NOT authentic which I guess is ok because I think they are going for a gourmet feel. The atmosphere is so nice - elegant and chic at the same time.But the food was disappointing. Their dosa isn&#39;t crispy! Lacking in flavor, which is sad for South Indian food. Would only go there for the atmosphere if the people I&#39;m with dont care about good food.

I really like this dosa location. The food is also always delicious. The best dish I&#39;ve ordered here has got to be the channa bhatura. It comes out as a large puff dough thing. It&#39;s definitely not healthy but it&#39;s really good. If you haven&#39;t tried it you definitely should! They allow you to reserve a table via opentable which I really find handy. As a pac heights resident, this place is on the top of my $$$ list.

I don&#39;t know a whole a lot about Indian food. I know that the occasional times I&#39;ve had it, I&#39;ve usually enjoyed it &amp; that I wish I would have it more often.That being said, I recently had dinner at Dosa with a group of 12 for a friend&#39;s birthday. The birthday boy and his girlfriend were the only ones who had ever been here before, but it was with a much smaller group. We were all pretty dumbfounded on how/what to order for 12 people. I didn&#39;t get involved in the whole process of what to order since I&#39;ll eat just about anything (I hardly even glanced at the menu, actually). In fact, I&#39;m not sure if anyone I dined with had much of say in what we ordered. The birthday boy asked our waitress (who was wonderful!) what/how much we should order and she took care of us.Honestly, I can&#39;t tell you the name of even one thing I ate since I didn&#39;t order it or look at the menu, but I do know everything we had was delicious! Our waitress did a good job of picking out a variety of food and did an excellent job of staggering out when each course came.The restaurant itself is very nice, and there&#39;s plenty of seating on both levels. I had a couple beers with my meal, but some of the cocktails on the menu sounded delicious (I DID peruse the drink menu...of course)! The couple who had been here before actually knew a guy who used to be a bartender here, and they both said that the signature cocktails are yummy!The service here is also excellent! Our waitress was very helpful and patient serving 12 people &amp; and we had no issues (and I believe no extra charge) for cake service (the birthday boy&#39;s parents brought in there own cake). I thought this was very nice on the restaurant &#39;s part.I would like to come back to Dosa with a smaller group and maybe have more of a say in what I order (even though like I said, everything I had on this past visit was excellent) as well as try a cocktail or three!

If I could give this place zero stars, I would. I was visiting San Fran, and was having a special day out with my aunt and her partner. I felt like the server was intentionally trying to piss us off. When we went in, the server took forever to take our orders even though the restaurant was empty save a couple in the corner and one other small family. She was chatting with the small family forever. Then when she took our drink orders, we all ordered chai tea. When my aunt got it, she didn&#39;t realize it was milk based and asked the server for another drink since she&#39;s lactose intolerant. That also took forever because our server said she kept forgetting... When we finally got our food, no one explained what the sauces were to us. This wouldn&#39;t have been a problem if I didn&#39;t hear the server explain everything in detail to the couple sitting in the corner. After, my aunt ordered another drink which she just never got.Perhaps it was a race thing since we were the only people of color in the restaurant, or maybe our server just had some unknown, personal vendetta against us. Either way, I&#39;m never going back there. San Francisco has way too many nice places to give Dosa a second chance.

Ok I realize I am giving it 4 stars compared to the other million 5&#39;s. Here goes my reason, the price they charge for a dosa does not seem reasonable. Dosa unlike a prime steak or things of that nature that deals with pricey raw materials, does not cost all that much to make. So when I think of the folds of profit they make on an item, it does not seem to add up. Well on the flip side, its more of an upscale locale with a great decor. The waiters seemed seriously concerned about my satisfaction which is always nice. The dip dishes was intense. I am from south India where this dish originates and no kidding they have nailed their sambar recipe.

I have read some of the bad reviews of this place and they should be ignored on the basis of their ignorance of indian food and the intense labor required to prepare.This is the first place I have been to where I felt the price matched the quality of the food. This is expensive, but where are you going to go and find a upscale restaurant with high-end decor that offers traditional south indian food that is healthy.I frequent Darbar in Palo Alto and that restaurant pales in comparison to DOSA. I have never been to a South Indian, or any Indian restaurant that serves healthy meals and uses organic or locally sourced ingredients and free-range meats.DOSA is by far the best south indian restaurants I have visited because of how they prepare their dishes. Most places you go, the dosas are beyond greasy, the &#34;masala&#34; (spiced potato filling) is either bland or too spicy and lacks in complexity of flavors. DOSA makes their masala dosa&#39;s with your health in mind. The dosa I received was amazing, the filling was delicious and the chutney served along side the sambar was amazing.Once thing to note: the sambar is super spicy, however, this is to be expected with south indian food. I had two bowls of it and wanted more, but my tongue was already on fire. This is not the restaurants fault, this is traditional south indian cooking at its finest. the only negative was that the sambar was a little heavy on the tamarind, though I didn&#39;t complain as I loved the gorgeous color.We also ordered the Kale Pakora (we ordered two rounds of it) and that was equally amazing.The couple who started this restaurant knows what they are doing and understands their clientele. They know that San Franciscans appreciate fine dining and healthy cuisine. San Franciscans have a plethora of ethnic dining options and will frequent those that use ingredients found at DOSA.

I am Indian and we indians tend to be a bit hard on indian restaurants.The plus sides of this restaurant are that most the dishes are sufficiently authentic. Often times when you have an indian restaurant that is not &#39;dhaba&#39; style you get this odd fusion type indian food which I hate.The only letdown ironically (besides that there&#39;s only 2 non-veg dishes on the lunch menu) are that the dosas themselves were a bit bland! Arre! For a south indian restaurant thats almost criminal! But there are a lot of non-dosa dishes to choose from.I had a kati roll (which they call a &#39;frankie&#39;, why god only knows) that was very good.

I mostly love the food here. It is delish. So many spices, masterfully wielded.I also love the fact that they have so many gluten-free options, and will provide a menu with all of the dietary restriction information spelled out.I was disappointed today, though. I had the Chicken Xacuti for lunch with a friend there a few days ago and it was absolutely delicious. Hoping to share the deliciousness with my mother, I took her to Dosa this evening. Sadly, this Chicken Xacuti was made with so much hot pepper that it hid the delicious spice mixture of non-hot pepper spices like cardamon that made the Chicken Xacuti that I had for lunch there sing. It was very sad that they are inconsistent. When they aren&#39;t inconsistent, they are golden.Both dosas that my lunch companions and I had, the spicy basil dosa and the spring vegetable dosa, were very good, and the sauces that they came with are marvelous.The surroundings are beautiful, but the music is a little too loud.

&#34;You like dosa, right?&#34;&#34;Uhhh...&#34;&#34;Stuffed Indian crepes that you dip in stuff.&#34;&#34;Then yes.&#34;That&#39;s pretty much the extent of what I knew going into my first dosa experience at a restaurant whose name clearly shows off their focus. For those of you not yet introduced to the addiction, you&#39;re basically looking at massive crepe creations wrapped around masala potato fillings. You can order any number of varieties and then get to dipping them in a variety of sauces from coconut to curried lentils. So pretty much the best thing ever.Dosa (the restaurant) is gorgeous particularly if you nab a seat in the upper loft that shows off the many fine details they sank into the design. Staff are very professional, attentive and helpful when it comes to first-timers. There was a bit of weirdness when we ordered several bottles of wine to share for the table - i.e. they were only bringing them out one at a time... - but otherwise smooth sailing from start to finish.The massive portions are best served up to share. Three people can easily be bested by two dosas although feel free to go nuts in order to try more flavours. The only one you&#39;ll need though is the white truffle. Seriously. It may be the only food I ever want to eat again.

I&#39;ve been to Dosa about a half dozen times and feel that I&#39;m finally ready for a review.This is one of those instances where I wish I could give three and a half stars, but I&#39;ll just err on the side of four.The place is gorgeous. It&#39;s big, moody and has a nice bar area with solid beers. The bartenders are cool.Wait staff is hit or miss. Sometimes they are fun and easy and other times they are stuck up and have this look like they&#39;re snickering at you. Mostly they are nice.I don&#39;t eat meat, and I think the veggie and fish options are solid. The Scallop app is really tasty and while their samosas are only ok, the tamarind sauce is insane--sweet and tart.I haven&#39;t had a bad dosa there yet, though the curries can be hit or miss.Is it overpriced? Yeah, mostly. Is it tasty and fresh and fun? Yeah, mostly.

I think this place ought to hang a sign on the front stating &#34;stupid white people please come in and enjoy&#34; because that&#39;s about all that will really find this place to be the bomb. The owner is from East India not South. The food is totally different in the two regions. There are only a couple of South Indian cooks. Look in the kitchen they are the dark skinned ones. You will only see maybe 2. All the other cooks were your typical Mexican or Chinese looking. Most of the patrons were white. White people in an Indian restaurant is not a good sign. Indians go to really good Indian restaurants, Indians know how to cook and are not going to pay to eat lousy food. Especially $11.00 for a dosa.In short I think the Mumbai/Bombay owner needs to thank all you stupid whities for making him so bloody rich.

I always thought of Dosa as a fancy shmancy restaurant with over-priced Indian food - why pay that much when I can get some cheaper food in Berkeley??? I was so wrong...Everything was seriously a flavor punch in the face. To start, we had the chennai chicken and the lotus stem day boat scallops. Chennai chicken all the way! Great texture, spicy (use the raita to cool down) and good size portion too! The scallops were really fresh and I loved the two different sauces on the plate. We also tried the white truffle masala dosa and tomato and onion uttapam. The dosa was the clear winner between the two. How can you beat potatoes?! The dosa itself was crispy and actually kinda fun to eat. The coconut and tomato chutneys were really tasty too. The uttapam was yummy but not memorable. For main entrees the bf had the lamb kofta and I had the pepper chicken. Both were super yummy but I liked the flavor of the lamb dish better. The pepper chicken did make for some awesome next day lunch leftovers.Dosa on Fillmore also has a happy hour until 7pm where they offer some of their drinks and bites for $6.Service was on point and the decor is so pretty!I haven&#39;t written a five-star review in awhile, nuff said.

My review for Dosa is already biased. We wanted to go for Dine About Town, but apparently they don&#39;t offer that menu on Saturdays. Womp. We also had a reservation for a group, and had to wait between 20-30 minutes to sit down. Double womp.By the time we sat down, we were restless and annoyed, but they did offer us an appetizer as an apology.The place is really fancy schmancy if that&#39;s what you like. Extravagant decor and an elegance about the place. The food was solid, although combining curries makes your palatte all messed up. We got the shrimp masala and a chicken dish. At the restaurant, we thought the shrimp masala was way better, so all our chicken was left untouched. But as I ate the chicken leftovers the next day, I found that it was also pretty delicious.We opted to get dishes and share, instead of their $40 pre-fixe menu. Total wasn&#39;t too bad considering we had cocktails too. It ended up being around $40 per person including tax and tip.

Eat here. Now. Don&#39;t hesitate. Just go and get anything. I enjoyed the lamb chops and duck. The old fashioned on the drink menu is superb. Had no complaints when eating at the bar, but would do a table reservation next time.

My most recent experience at Dosa on Fillmore was quite pleasant. I&#39;d visited both Dosa locations in the past and had a preference for the Valencia location because it felt cosier and more inviting. I&#39;d commented to several friends in the past that although the Fillmore location looks nice, the combination of the high ceiling and the size of the restaurant makes it feel less private and more exposed.However, on my most recent visit I was seated in a little area on the second floor just next to/behind the bar. Sitting up in that area I felt far more cozy and far less exposed. (It would also be an ideal place to people watch.)The food at both locations is good. As their name implies, they make many different kinds of dosas, but they also a few other dishes like curries. I sampled a soup, a duck curry, an uttapam, and a lamb dish on my most recent visit and was quite satisified.

i LOVE Dosa on Valencia and have never been to the Fillmore location until last night. after catching a movie at my beloved Kabuki Theater, a friend and i decided to finally try this location out.my initial thoughts: this place is fancy, but not stuffy or pretentious. i&#39;m okay with that. it&#39;s a lot bigger than the Valencia location and would be great for a special occasion like a birthday or anniversary dinner.we ordered two small plates (the coconut seafood soup and the shredded duck) and one dosa (the white truffle masala; my favorite!). for dessert we got the pistachio dacquoise with chocolate chile mousse. the shredded duck was good, but too spicy for me. after a few bites, i had to throw in the towel (but i&#39;m wuss when it comes to spicy eats). the soup was delicious and had a good amount of seafood in it, which i always appreciate. the white truffle masala dosa has long been a favorite of mine, but this time it wasn&#39;t as flavorful. for that dish, i&#39;d go to the one on Valencia for perfection. the dessert was probably the highlight for me--an enjoyable mix of textures and a perfect balance of salty and sweet, with just a touch of heat from the chocolate chile mousse. i highly recommend.service was great. our waiter did a wonderful job of describing dishes we had questions about and recommending things based on what we were craving.the food was good, but for me, not as memorable as the food at the Valencia location. it was almost like the flavors here were more refined, which suits the decor and overall vibe of the restaurant, but next time you&#39;ll definitely find me at Dosa on Valencia.

Can I give it 6 stars!? I LOVE this place! The wonderful experience begins as you walk through the door. The place is gorgeous, the staff is really friendly and helpful. But I would come back if neither of those were true. The food! Oh, the food! I started with the kohlrabi and cauliflower soup and my wife had to restrain me from licking the bowl. The North and South samosas were also excellent (the South was my favorite... caramelized onion... yum!). Then I tried several different dosas and each gave me a different experience of flavors... subtle and dare I say, complex. Run, don&#39;t walk to Dosa on Fillmore. You will thank me.

So dissatisfied with their service. Called at 3 to try to get a 6:45 reservation. Was told they were booked, but to come in, they always have a few open tables and bar seating. Showed up at 6:30 and asked about the aforementioned &#39;Open Tables&#39;. The blonde east European-accented hostess literally laughed when she sneered,&#34;Open tables at DOSA on a Friday night?&#34;The reviews may be rave, but sorry, that attitude doesn&#39;t fly for a non-Michelin restaurant. Get over yourselves.

When coming to Dosa, I had high expectations. Having grown up on Indian food, I unfortunately can be a little picky when eating at Indian places. From the moment I entered, I smelled a familiar aroma that assured me that I was not going to regret this experience.FIrst off, we went around 8 and maybe because it was a weeknight, we did not need a reservation. To start things off, we ordered some Mango Lassis. These didn&#39;t taste like the Lassis I&#39;ve had in India or Sri Lanka, but they were still pretty good. We then received some complimentary papadum which was good (to be fair though, it&#39;s really difficult to screw up papadum).So for the main dish, I ordered the Paper Masala Dosa since it was on the 7x7 list while my housemate ordered the South Indian Moons Uttapam. For both dishes, we were amazed by the presentation. The Paper Masala Dosa was so long that they had a difficult time figuring out how to place it on the table. As for the South Indian Moons, it was the envy of all the tables surrounding us as we had constant questions from those around us asking what that dish was. Both meals definitely tasted quite delicious and you can bet that we&#39;ll be back again.

I am a little surprised at all the negative reviews. Staff was friendly and helpful, and seemed passionate about the food. The food was yummy. We got a couple of different sampler style plates to share. Super flavorful and yummy. Also, surprisinly big portions in this era of tiny bites. My only regret is that there were so many other great places to eat at that we didn&#39;t make it back to Dosa&#39;s before heading home to Seatle. Minus one star because the chai was not to our liking at all.

TOP 10 REASONS TO DINE AT DOSA:10) SPACE! (Unlike the Valencia location, which makes you feel like a sardine.)9) Ambiance (Any Indian restaurant that isn&#39;t a hole in the wall, doesn&#39;t make you order at the counter, and can be described as upscale, classy and romantic gets an A+.)8) Service (Friendly, attentive and efficient.)7) Entertainment (Get a kick out of watching unsuspecting diners who are unfamiliar with the spiciness of Southern Indian food down their glass of water in 2.5 seconds.)6) Your homemade Indian food never turns out this good.5) Tasting menu (With all savory courses to choose from! Mango prawns for dessert? Yes, please.)4) Chennai chicken (Yes, yes, please!)3) Duck vindaloo (Yes, yes, yes, please!)2) Dosas! Duh. (You can&#39;t go wrong with any of them, except the white truffle oil one just seems like a crime against humanity. Just saying.)1) You&#39;re a glutton for punishment &#39;cuz it hurts so good! (Spice wimps, stay home.)

As someone who has tried to coordinate a number of large group dinings in San Fran from afar, it can be tough. Pre-set menus, price negotiations, one time I had to promise that our group would vacate within 1.5 hours. Jeesh. But that wasn&#39;t the case at Dosa. Service was outstanding, right from the get go. I was warmly received, and promptly responded to. And when it came to the evening of our reso, the manager even came over to shake my hand. I like that level of service.Now, I need to warn you, listen to your server. The dosas are entree sized. They&#39;re sharable. After appies, two dosas for 3 people is probably a sufficient amount. Each dosa comes with 3 dips - and you know, I&#39;m just a gal that loves dips so I was in heaven!Food highlights of the evening include the sardines - wow, they&#39;re huge, samosas, lamb kebab, and of course, my dosa - the original with chutney. Flavour? Awesome. Just go, just dip, just laugh.As a large group, it was great to have a separate area that felt like it was just for us. If I were arranging another group here, I&#39;d request the mezzanine again. Tis a beautiful space to enjoy some mighty fine dosas!

I definitely don&#39;t get out to eat Indian food as frequently as I would like. And it&#39;s one of my favourite cuisines! So of course I was stoked to hear that reservations had been made for Dosa. The menu was curious (I have this thing where I get major anxiety when I go out for dinner and I don&#39;t look up the menu beforehand). No butter chicken, only a couple of curries, and a major selection of dosas. Majah.The place is GORG. Let&#39;s just get that out of the way. Our table was kind of upstairs in the loft-type space and we looked out over the rest of Dosa. Ambience, atmosphere, and staff are great. Love it.Our appies were quite tasty. I&#39;m not the hugest samosa fan but these were pretty darn tasty. Awesome lamb kebob, too.I didn&#39;t go the dosa route and ordered an entree instead. My pepper chicken, and I mean, I guess I should have expected this, was super spicy. I like kick....I love kick. But this had way too much kick. Delicious, but I couldn&#39;t finish! (A combination of too much spice, and being too full from the tasty appies.)Overall a good night, but I&#39;ll do the dosa next time.

THIS PLACE WAS AMAZING.I went with my friend and her parents who were visiting, and we got to try a lot of items on the menu. The design and layout of the restaurant is very chic and classy. The server was really kind and helpful. She explained to us in fine detail what each dish we asked about was.We had so many appetizers, they&#39;re chutney variety in the sampler was amazing, and you get the pappadum on on the side. We also tried the samosas which were fried to a perfect crisp with flavor that popped, and the chennai chicken which had the perfect amount of spice and came with a delightful yogurt dip. We tried one of the dosas, but unfortunately I have no clue which one it was. Ours had potatoes and some great spices in it, which yummy sauces and lentil soup to eat it with. For the main course, my friend and I split the prawn masala with the coconut rice. The portion was perfect to be split with two. I&#39;ve only had chicken tikka masala before, but it tasted amazing with the prawns. The sauce was perfectly rich and creamy, with a mind-blowing bold flavor. I would recommend this dish 1000000 times. I also suggest that everyone keep all their sauces, because each dish comes with a unique dip, sauce, chutney that is amazing in its own way.

OMG delicious! I&#39;ve never had southern Indian food before, and I will certainly seek it out from now on. To begin with, it&#39;s a beautiful restaurant - stylish decor, but didn&#39;t seem pretentious. I started with a sweet mango lassi, which was super tasty. My boyfriend, two friends, and I split the Samosas South and North for an appetizer, a selection of five different types of uttapams, the paneer and peas dosa, and the lamb kofta. Everything was so good - the lentil dipping sauce, the chutneys, the fresh veggies and cheeses. We ended with gulab jamon and chocolate chai ice cream - save room for dessert and you will not regret it.It was also really easy to get to via bus from Union Square.

Great date spot. The indian food is definitely made for a western palate but it&#39;s executed well and the ambiance can&#39;t be beat.High ceilings with a swanky bar area. The food here is substantial to say the least. Definitely share. and definitely get a Dosa (they&#39;re like giant samosas without the fried skin).Unique cocktail list &#34;made for spicy food&#34;.Don&#39;t come here expecting an authentic indian experience. but DO come here to hang with friends or on a date because it won&#39;t be a controversial choice.

Alright, so rolled into Dosa at the least optimal time. It was about 4:30 on a Sunday afternoon while they were prepping for dinner. Fortunately, me and my main gal prefer to post at the bar so that wasn&#39;t a problem and sampled the bar menu.Had some beers and tried everything on the bar menu and would have to tip the cap to the fried chicken bites. Fortunately the main dinner menu opened up and we were able to roll up the sleeves.The duck vindaloo is an absolute joke - so good. Just fall off the bone duck served over some basmati rice. The heat was solid but not overwhelming and just couldnt have been more tender - literally shredding off the bone. This was my first experience with this regional Indian cuisine and it was money.Definitely recommend giving Dosa a try but bring a benji at a minimum.Also had the mushroom nan - not my bag but my D8 loved it, so there&#39;s that.

This was my 1st real indian food experience and I thought it was very legit. Food was great, tasty and the ambiance is fantastic! Filmore street is famous for having great restaurants and Dosa doesn&#39;t stay behind.I came here with a group of girls and we were all very happy about our food choices. we ordered a few items and shared, so we tried more items from the menu.The bar is pretty sweet too if you just want to come for appetizers and drinks.

Definitely get the chutney sampler to start and a dosa. I really liked the white truffle dosa, and it went great with all the dipping sauces (and the chutney sampler too!). Nice ambience for a date night, and they have great cocktails too (even a standard gin &amp; tonic had a little twist to it here). Menu items are great for sharing (so you can try everything) or individual entree style too.

Ordered the 7x7 list choice: paper masala dosa.The boy and I decided that it&#39;s a great place to eat, high class Indian food. The dish was fun to eat with your hands and while it would have been nice to have been given some hand sanitizer, it was fun. We decided that it was a great place for a 3rd date or something. You don&#39;t mind the small touches and it&#39;s a great way to break that touch barrier. Anyways, we have too much fun talking about relationships and other people&#39;s relationships. He ordered a pomegranate mimosa, and I ordered the Mango Lassi. Delicious. The lassi that is. Very creamy.The paper dosa is like a really really really really really thin piece of naan. There were great potatoes that came along with it. Two different sauces too. One was red and had some heat, the other was green, coconut flavor and really cooled down. It was a really great way to get one of the 100 list down, and a great dish to be shared by two for lunch.

One of my favorites.You can get a great steak a few places in the city but a dosa, only here. Everything that I&#39;ve tried so far is incredible. I came in expecting some bomb Indian food but... it was so much more. It was nothing like I&#39;ve ever tried. It was new, it was different, it was delicious. I suggest getting help from the staff in deciding what to get because this isn&#39;t your typical Indian food.Also their drinks... just as different and delicious. I tried the Peony, spice &amp; milk mixed with fun (its not for everyone though).

I would need to dine here again to get a good idea. Only dined here once, but we did enjoy it and plan to return. The decor is grand and opulent. A lil over the top, but interesting. The restaurant is HUGE! Used to be a Goodwill which is kinda funny. We were sat upstairs which was super dooper cramped! I had to keep moving my seat so the server could get to the tables next to us which had like 4&#34; of space between and anyone leaving the far right hand corner table I had to almost get out of my seat for. It was like being in a tiny cramped movie theater. I would not sit there again. The floors on the bottom level were so NOT heel friendly and slippery that I was holding onto my friend. I have never had to do that in my life! We&#39;d go here again, but we&#39;d sit on the bottom level.Food was good, but not great. Would order dosa&#39;s again, but not that one with the sunchokes. Those are gross.

From the outside, this restaurant looks like an over-sized, imposing box. Inside, it is gorgeous, if a little too dark. The menu is a mix of dosas (obvi), curries, and other dishes, along w/several smaller plates. Are you veggie, vegan, or gluten-free? Guess what, there is a special and extensive menu just for you! This allowed me to give Dosa the 4th star!Stars awarded:1 star for atmosphere1 star for the beer list which included many locals brews and one of my faves from Firestone!1 star for the vegan options!1 star for the serviceBut, I have to minus one star for the price! This place is expensive! Not outrageous but too much for Indian food. I realize that it borders Pacific Heights, and the food is good but this is SF where Indian food that is just as good can be purchased for much less.Go here when you need to keep an eye on the line at the Sundance Kabuki across the street, when you need added fanciness to your Indian food experience, and when you have two wonderful dining companions who don&#39;t seem to mind the finer things in life.

We had lunch at Dosa, Fillmore recently wanted to share our experience. We decided to go to Dosa, Fillmore because of really good Yelp reviews and also based on what we had heard from our friends. Let me start off by saying that this review may be a bit biased because I am originally from Bangalore, India where Dosa is staple breakfast and the bar for Dosa is really high for people from Bangalore and Mysore.Let me start off with what I liked, the ambience is good, the place is huge and tables are setup with people&#39;s privacy in mind unlike most other indian restaurants where they put tables really close just to maximize profits, this is where the good part ends!.The service was ok, though I expected more for the price, oh did it say it is priceeeeeey, our waiter looked really stressed and forgot a few things we ordered but was quick to fix it.Now, let&#39;s talk about the food, if you are brave enough to name your restaurant Dosa, you got to make sure that your Dosas are absolutely the best especially if you are going to charge $15 to $20 for a Dosa. I am absolutely cool with paying that kind of money if the quality and taste is up-to the mark, sadly it isn&#39;t. I and my friend ordered the Mysore Masala Dosa, these types of Dosa are suppose to be bit thicker, crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside, it was thin and soggy, it was horrible, I can get better dosa for less than half the price in south bay!. The chutneys were not made fresh and quantity was tiny, Dosas are eaten with a lot of chutney, this place needs to double or triple the quantity of chutney they serve. If you have never had Dosas before, you can try this place, if you know what good Dosas should taste like, avoid this place, save your money and pick any hole in the wall south indian restaurant, you will be more satisfied!.

This is one of the best, if not the best, Indian restaurants in SF. I have now gone three times and would go again any time in a heartbeat. Everything I&#39;ve ever ordered has been delicious and the ambiance is terrific. Great decor, and the noise level and table spacing are just right to ensure you can enjoy your party&#39;s conversation, but not everyone else&#39;s. I can&#39;t recommend a specific menu item, because every single thing I&#39;ve had has been terrific. In summary: eat at Dosa. It&#39;s super-delicious.

I had been wanting to eat at DOSA for a long time so I was excited to have dinner and drinks.The restaurant is beautiful. The decor is very sleek and it has a great bar area. The dining room is nice but I had a problem with the noise level and the crowded seating arrangement. It&#39;s so crammed and I was practically sitting on top of the woman next to me.

Heading back from &#34;Precious&#34; at the Sundance Kabuki next door, I dropped in for a light dinner at the &#34;Dosa on Filmore&#34;, having been at it&#39;s sister concern on Valencia a few times before.The first impression I had was &#34;where is the door?&#34; The front entrance looked more like a fire-exit on the side but the heavy-set door called out &#34;automatic, pull &amp; release&#34; and pull I did. Though I forgot about the release part and almost got my hand stuck as the door pushed against the wall --- apparently I was still trying to come to terms with the age-old question of &#34;where is the door&#34; that I clean forgot to follow up my &#34;pull&#34; with my &#34;release&#34;.Once inside, I was told a table would take a few minutes and was offered a place at the &#34;communal table&#34; which was a not unlike a bar counter with height tables and high chairs; except, no bar tender --- but fret not, there is a full bar mere feet away from where you would have parked your hiney. This location is much roomier and has a more relaxed atmosphere than the one at Valencia. It has a &#39;loungey&#39; feel with it&#39;s soft lighting while it&#39;s sister is perennially crying out for space.After wrestling with the idea of trying a crab vada against my age-old favorite of &#34;medu vada&#34; for an appetizer, I decided to go for &#34;change I can believe in&#34; and opted for the crab vada. I mean, what else screams &#34;liberal&#34; more than that. Right ? The crab vada was close to a crab cake without actually being a crab cake. It certainly had a South Indian essence to it which I can&#39;t quite put a finger on, but the batter seemed to suggest more &#34;pakoda&#34; (batter of chickpea flour) than &#34;vada&#34; (based on rice and lentils batter). The swirl of mint and tamarind chutney on the spotless white plate lent the presentation a touch of class a la fine-dining restaurants that are one level above on the price-point hierarchy. After all is said and done, the crab vada was good but I prefer my good ol&#39; medu vada and medu vada would be it the next time around.The famed Masala Dosa followed up as my entree and it did not disappoint. The dosa was crispy, well done and just about right; something that it&#39;s sister concern (or, the &#34;mother ship&#34;) on Valencia failed to get right on all my visits there. In the dosa face-off between &#39;mother ship&#39; and &#39;sister concern&#39;, the race is tight since the &#34;sambhar&#34; here could not possibly hold a candle against that served at the Valencia Establishment which, to this day, I consider &#34;the best Sambhar in the world&#34;.So, why 3 stars? Well for one, there is the Sambhar which failed to measure up to my sky high expectations, and the crab vada which was good but not 4- or 5- stars good. If the Medu vada lives up to my expectations on my next visit, coupled with my lowered expectations of the Sambhar, I&#39;d definitely rate it 4 stars.So, yes, you go ahead and rate it 4 stars; it is well deserved. But for me to change the rating, I will just have to see it again from my recalibrate point of view the next time I swing by (which won&#39;t be long).

Dosa is a great experience and for the price can&#39;t be missed. The ambiance and service for the price is spot on and I&#39;ll come back often, just not on a Friday night. Our service didn&#39;t suffer, our water glasses were never empty and our meal was brought to us in a reasonable amount of time.My date had the Masala Chutney and next time I return I intend to try one of their Dosa plates, it was excellent. She has tried a few of the plates off the Dosa menu and mentioned they all are good.I ordered the Peper Chicken and the sauce that it was prepared in was wonderful but since it was in a small bowl I spent more than half of our dinner cutting it off the bone and it did not come close to filling me up. We also ordered the Samosas and I recommend you give these a try. They do come with sauce but it&#39;s not needed. I also had a Mint Lemonade that was OK but apparently too sweet for my taste, what was I thinking.We had reservations for 9PM and arrived at 8:58 only to wait at least fifteen minutes, maybe more. I won&#39;t ever come back on a Friday or Saturday evening.Total bill was about $40.Health Card = 94

Wow! Super tasty Indian place. Prices are quite reasonable for this level of quality as well.It really hits on all the marks of a good dining experience:- Not hard to get in or get reservations.- Attractive, clean decor.- Focused and still impressively diverse menu.- Delicious food!- We had mostly fast and very friendly service.I would only complain that the parking situation is a pain in that neighborhood, but it&#39;s the city, so... yeah...I had the duck. It rocked my socks. Everything awesome about duck, then smothered in a spicy curry sauce. Sooooooooooooo yummy.

Definitely upscale overpriced Indian food. Great ambiance in a great location bumps the prices up I suppose. I came with a friend for dine about town and so we went off the pre fixe menu. The scallops were deliciously spicy but you only get 2, the chennai chicken was ok - chewy, basically boneless chicken wings - ended up handing those over for my friend to finish. As for the main courses the mango &amp; paneer dosa was kindof blah - like a crispy pancake filled with cheese that you dip in a bunch of sauces, and the tomato &amp; onion uttapam looked exactly like an omelette with veggies - tasty but small. The pepper chicken curry was delicious but by this point I was stuffed with wine and the appetizers and would have preferred a dessert option instead.As for the wine, the $18 tasting flight is a rip off as we were told you only get about the equivalent of one glass of wine. So we ordered a bottle of one of the less expensive redson the menu (still 40 something) and it was barely drinkable, but we didn&#39;t want to be those people and send it back.I suppose if you have the money and/or a special occasion this would be a great place. I&#39;m a big fan of the open and airy space with upstairs seating and service was excellent, but not sold on the whole dosa concept. Major negative points for the SF health tax. I think if I want Indian food in the future I&#39;ll go to the $10 buffet down the street.

I definitely have mixed feelings about this place after reading such phenomenal reviews on Yelp. I was expecting this place to blow my mind; instead it just barely registered as okay.Came here on a Wednesday night with a reservation for two and was seated after about 5 minutes despite the place looking quite empty around 7 pm. The ambiance is definitely nice and the hostess was friendly, but they sat us in the smallest table ever and my friend isn&#39;t exactly the kind to fit into small spaces. So we requested a bigger table and was surprised (given the emptiness of the place) that she had to check with the hostess.After being seated we were brought out their house appetizer and water very quickly and was asked about our selections for the evening. However, our waitress, after much debate, actually advised against me ordering all of the items I wanted to order on the menu claiming that it would be too much food. I was never given this concept in my life so I figured I might as well trust her. Later on I ended up ordering my original menu because there was not enough food.I have to say this place has its up&#39;s but I am pretty surprised at the waitress telling me that I would have too much food when clearly their portions are TINY. I do mean very small for an Indian place and definitely not something I expected to see. We ordered samosas for appetizers and it came with two (one of each kind from &#34;north&#34; and &#34;south&#34;) ... this was the beginnings of my question about how this could possibly be too much food since when you order a variety they don&#39;t even give you more than one?Furthermore, the thicker &#34;dosas&#34; were definitely not as good as their original dosas and most of their dishes (unless its masala based) are not good. We ordered one entree each and the non-masala entree, although sounded great, was definitely a miss.Other than that, they have great sauces and great dipping &#34;soups&#34;. Their lemon rice was good and their egg dosa was definitely delicious.I don&#39;t know that I would come back to pay this kind of price for the kind of stuff I could get with a much better attitude at a hole in the wall Indian place instead.

Dosa was an excellent experience. The drinks at the bar were great and the food was superb. We ordered the chutney sampler, which was excellent, and the chennai chicken (really spicy but really good).For an entree, we shared the vegetable curry with pratha, and the white truffle masala dosa. Everything was excellent. A must try!

Went here for a dinner date after recommendations from friends. Definitely a nice environment with dim lighting and a great date night atmosphere. The wine list was good-- though quite pricey. My boyfriend thought it would be a great place to take me because I LOVE Indian food, but the menu is very small and didn&#39;t have any of my favorite Indian choices. The server told us that if we had never had a Dosa before, we had to try one. Since we had not, we ordered the traditional Masala Dosa. When it came out it looked like an over sized pancake with a big scoop of mashed potatoes in the center. We opened it up and had to spread the filling over the whole &#34;pancake&#34;. It tasted how it looked and the dipping sauces did not add much flavor.My trip to Dosa was highly anticipated after hearing many great reviews, but my experience was not good. Friends say that next time we go we should order one of the entrees and not the Dosa, but I am not sure we will be going back.

Recommend: Chennai Chicken, Masala Dosa, South Indian Moons UttapamA group of us came here for my fiance&#39;s birthday dinner, so we sampled quite a few entrees. Good overall, but heavy with the spices. Their prawn masala was probably the tastiest. We ended our meals with their dark chocolate cake (recommended by our waitress) and tearamisu. If you only have room for one, go with the chocolate cake. Absolutely divine. They also stuck a candle in one of the desserts someone else at our table ordered and brought it out for my fiance. Our friend continued to wait for his dessert until we later realized my fiance and I were devouring it. Real cheap, especially since we dropped some serious $$$ on food and drinks.

My first time was definitely better than my second, but nevertheless, it&#39;s a gastronomic adventure. Gorgeous restaurant, friendly staff, and great ambiance. I took my girlfriend here this past weekend and she had a great experience!I highly recommend the meat dishes over the vegetarian ones here; they have better flavors, showcases the ingredients well, and the spices are just incredible! The Chennai Chicken and Bhel Puri are great appetizers for 2-4, but I recommend staying away from the Rasam Fire Broth Soup (you&#39;re going to get sambar with your dosa anyway).As for entrees, the prawn masala was delicious-- 10/10 would order again. I also tried the chicken and eggplant curry, paneer and peas dosa, roasted chile and garlic masala dosa, trumpet mushrooms uttapam, and the mixed chile uttapam. Everything was really good except for the mixed chile uttapam! While I love spicy foods, the habanero was a little overwhelming and I couldn&#39;t taste anything else.I was too full for dessert the second time, but they have a changing dessert menu that will pique your interest. So if you decide to come here, stick to the meat dishes, order a dosa, and save some room for dessert!

Please sir, can I have some more Dosa?We came here as a group of 10 or so and sat upstairs. I&#39;d never eaten a Dosa before, being the restaurant&#39;s namesake, I thought I had better. The rava masala is what I found myself ordering, sweet potatoes under a crispy crepe like thing with some different sauces to dip.We also shared some appys... Get the lamb! I totally love lamb.

I came in here last night after a comedy show at the Fillmore. We were seated immediately on the upper floor without a reservation. Score! The food came out very quick, almost unbelievably quick.Masala Chutney Dosa: ($11.50) good. Not what I was expecting for a chutney. It was a rather dry filling. I will try another type of dosa next time I&#39;m there.South Indian Moons Uttapan: (13.50) an array of their different uttapans. I would suggest getting this and deciding what types you like best for the next time you come in.Dessert: Coconut Custard Cake - do NOT recommend this. Overly sweet and just not worth the $8Prior to this visit I had come in and eaten at the bar before a movie at the Kabuki and had entrees and small plates. I would say the uttapans and dosas are a better choice. Great drinks the last time I was here too.Service was ok. The decor is great and I will definitely be back anytime I&#39;m attending shows in the area! P.S. They serve Mexican coke!

Serves modern, southern Indian food. Pretty decor and the place has a kind of a trendy nightclub vibe, that still feels friendly. Serves some unexpected combinations. It&#39;s one of those places where you get what you pay for, so if you are a big southern Indian food fan, go there.And oh, Dosa is like a big, stuffed Indian pancake with different fillings in if you didn&#39;t know that already.

This Dosa is larger and more upscale than the one on Valencia. The quality of the meals seems the same--very good. The menu is also varied, with choices for vegetarians and meat-eaters. It&#39;s possible, too, go easy on the spices (I&#39;ve noticed that people who shy away from Indian food seem to think it&#39;s all very spicy.) The person who seated our party of four took some time to deliver a kind of mini-lecture on the nature of the cuisine, etc. That seemed a bit odd, but probably it&#39;s welcomed by diners unacquainted with Indian food. Overall, the experience was very good--not overly loud, no rushing, hearty fare, etc.

Great Ambiance, good food and drinks and great service.I have eaten at the Dosa in mission, this was my first time at Dosa on Fillmore.The whole restaurant is nicely done, main dining (split into two levels), the bar area and the restrooms show investment and taste.The place was buzzing - it is definitely very popular so make a reservation. We were seated promptly. Our waitress was friendly, low-pressure and very helpful and pleasant - 5 stars for the right touch to service.The drink and wine menu is creative with plenty of choice.We ordered the fish pakoras and Chennai chicken for appetizers - plenty for a party of four. For the main course we got prawn masala, pepper chicken, green mango and paneer dosa and roasted chilly garlic masala dosa. The food came out promptly and was tasty, again service was excellent with multiple servers coordinating with the main waitress.For desert we had Madras coffee, dark chocolate cake and fresh coconut cake, everything was good.I give it 4 stars because the food, though very good, is a little Americanized and a touch below authentic. I would surely go back, take friends and recommend it to friends.

The waiter screwed up the wine pour and actually took glasses away from the table so he could pour wine from glass A into glass B so that B had the same amount as A!! That seemed really strange.He also kept telling us we &#34;are you sure you want that much food?&#34; Yes we were sure, we&#39;ve been there before and most of us eat a lot!

Our Japantown mini-vacation was charmed - in part because of Dosa.First of all, you walk in and feel immediately cooler than you did outside. Yes, I am a person who goes to restaurants that look like this. The big murals, abstract metal wall sculptures, and that big shiny chandelier thing over the host desk. Like a shower raining down non-tacky fabulousness.We came for lunch, so it wasn&#39;t super busy, and the server took time to make suggestions, taking into account our specific requests around spiciness and ingredients. He came back with each dish to explain things - managing to be attentive and explanatory without being overbearing.What a lovely experience!

Good things:- Nice looking decor- Interesting cocktails (hit or miss, but definitely interesting)- A few very good dishes (particularly the chicken biryanni, which I know is not spelled right)Not-so-good things:- Too expensive for Indian food- They do not serve traditional naan at all, and if you want any other type of bread and/or chutneys, you have to pay for them!- Dessert menu lacking some traditional Indian staples, such as gulab jamun!!

I love Dosa!I always get their dosas and some appetizers and I am always happy.This time, I really liked the grilled calamari. It came with a little baby octopus. So tender and delicious. The trumpet mushroom uttapam was also amazing. So many mushrooms, so much flavor. Didn&#39;t even use any of the sauces they brought.The dosas this time were ok, I think I&#39;ll need to try one of the entries next time.

I am pretty disappointed with this place. I have honestly never been a fan of Indian food, but I was told that this is the best one in the city. To start, the place itself is very nice and hip. And the service is good. But I just was not feeling the food. I did the &#34;tasting menu&#34;. Everything was really spicy, or if it did not have spice than it was super bland and needed to be dipped in a sauce. I feel like maybe that is just the way Indian food is, but I was not feeling it. For dessert I did like the saffron cake, but we also got these cheese dumplings that were not too exciting. The bill turned out to be pretty expensive ($110 for 2), and we did not even get alcoholic drinks... So I guess my attempts at liking Indian food are done, but if you are adventurous, give it a try.

They helped me customize a menu to meet the needs of all my guests and even brought us menu&#39;s with my name on them.

Walking into this place I knew it was going to be amazing. I absolutely loved the decor, probably my favorite ever.Obviously a popular place since it was packed on a weeknight and now I know why.The food. Delicious and extremely flavorful. We went with one small dish, one dosa and one larger dish to split between two of us. The waiter and manager were very attentive and willing to suggest certain dishes.After dinner, we had a few drinks at the bar and socialized with the bartender D&#39;France. He made a few specialty drinks for us and was very personable.Overall, fantastic experience and I will definitely be back if I ever am in SF again!

I live in the area and decided to give this place a try after someone offered to take me to dinner. This is definitely some place special.Our waitress was just wonderful. She didn&#39;t mind going over 6+ dishes we had inquiries about the dishes. She carefully selected a few dishes she felt was good for us based on what we described as our diet.I tried the Fish Moilee and boy... curry this light, aromatic, yet robust in flavors is just the best feeling in the world.We also tried a vegetable dosa dish and it was perfectly flaky and savory.This is definitely a must for special occasions as the price points are not made for everyday date stuff.

Good place, clean and a wonderful ambience. Mixed bag when it came to food - some wonderful dishes like the dahi wada and bhel. And some of the dosas were very good. The chutney (which is the soul of a good dosa) left much to be desired - didn&#39;t expect it in such a fancy place to be made of dedicated coconut. The Frankie&#39;s were mediocre at best. Overall expected slightly better quality for the price.

I was really looking forward to eating here. I have driven past this place a few times and had admired the chandeliers and the nice bar. The fact that it always seemed so crowded was a positive sign as well.We had a 9pm reservation and were there on time as usual . They were backed up and we had to wait around 15 mts to get our table. While we were waiting for our table, we soaked in the ambiance which was pretty nice. They had obviously taken some effort to set this place up as a hip and trendy place. I like the music and the paintings. Noticed that it was very loud and that they had packed in the tables which does not bother me. We got a couple of drinks while we waited and the bar tenders were very nice and friendly.We were seated upstairs and we looked at the menu which was surprisingly sparse. I have eaten at several South Indian restaurants and love dosas and know that there are ton more options than what they had listed here. The food was pricey but not not surprising given the location and the setup.I liked the papads (similar to crackers) that they served while we waited for our order. The Kerala fish curry was a little too fishy for me. The lamb kofta was spicy but yummy. The rice dishes and the dosas were good. The rasmalai that I had for dessert was pretty good. In hindsight, I should have gotten their fixed price 4 course menu which would have been a better deal. I almost forgot our waiter. He was nice but seemed a little loopy.Overall, it was an OK experience. Nice place to hang out and grab a few drinks and try some pretty unique food. There are a few South Indian restaurants in the Peninsula that have better food but not as chic. I will go back if I am in the area.

Seriously mixed feelings about this place and mostly due to service. With advance reservations and three tables empty, the hostess tries to sit us at the table by the bus area and kitchen door. Seriously?! We have to say no can we have a quieter table. I do not understand that. Then to make matters worse they take forever to bring my boyfriends drink, which means the rest of the table with wine is waiting. The tables are also very close and crowded, you have to move them so people can get in and out easily. With that being said, the food is pretty fantastic. I loved the sauces, the Dosa was great. How can you go there and not order a version? Everything we ordered was delicious and we left very full. The atmosphere of the place is great with the exception of feeling crowded.

It pains me to give this place a mere 3 star rating. I really wanted to like this place more. Let me start off by saying this place has an AMAZING ambiance. I love all the creative lighting, the friendly staff, and the bar is always a fun place to grab a drink even if you&#39;re not planning on eating here.We made reservations (which I highly recommend for Friday-Sunday at least). We were seated pretty quickly on arriving and ordered cocktails when we sat down. The waiter was very good at answering our questions, and was very knowledgeable about the menu. We wanted to split a bunch of dishes between the 4 of us so we asked the waiter what he suggested. He told us that 3 small plates, 1 entree, and 1 dosa would probably suffice and we could order more if we were still hungry afterward. Sounded good to me so that&#39;s exactly what we did. And of course we ordered 2 bottles of wine on top of that :)What We Ate:-Grilled Calamari ($10): Worst thing I had the whole night. 2/4 of us liked it. It just wasn&#39;t was I was expecting and the taste just didn&#39;t sit right with me. It came with like 8 pieces all together. The price for this appetizer was pretty ridiculous for such a tiny amount of food.-Hyderabadi Lamb Kebab ($12): The best appetizer I had. Just enough spice. This was really delicious! We were about to not order this as some of us don&#39;t really care for lamb (including myself), but we went for it anyways and I was pleasantly surprised.-Chennai Chicken ($10): These were excellent. It came with a lot of chicken and the yogurt dipping sauce was excellent. Definitely a spicy dish so have a glass of water ready with this one! I really enjoyed this small plate.-Hyderabadi Chicken Biryani ($20): This dish was alright. It was basically a medium bowl full of mostly rice and 2 chicken drumsticks. The taste was just so-so (almost tasted like chicken fried rice). For $20 I expected a much larger dish, or maybe the same amount of rice with way more chicken than what we were given.-Masala Dosa ($11): The dosa tasted absolutely AMAZING, but what threw me off was the one tiny glop of spiced mashed potatoes inside the massive lentil crepe that was on the plate. How the heck are you supposed to split a tiny spoonful of potatoes between 4 people? I was expecting something completely different (MORE potatoes). The flavor was perfect though and I absolutely loved the tomato and lentil dips it came with. The coconut dip was also good, but not my favorite.Our bill came to about $60/person including the tip and the 2 bottles of wine we ordered. Not bad for a fancy night out with friends, but next time I want Indian food I&#39;ll be going to a cheaper restaurant with the same/better quality, and save Dosa for a place to booze and socialize.

I was not a big fan of Indian food,but that&#39;s not b/c I didn&#39;t like it, it was b/c of the terrible experience I had a few years ago when our office ordered take out from this dump in Palo Alto and it was just nasty! Sandra told me to &#34;get over it&#34; and surprisingly I did give up that resentment towards all Indian restaurants in the world and I used to hang on to resentments way too long.So, this was my second time to Dosa, but first time going to the Fillmore location and wow, WOW! The building is just amazing. We sat upstairs and I really love the pictures on the wall, very vibrant and just aesthetically pleasing and just awesome!Everything on the menu was new to me, as mentioned above and I must say, the flavors were very well balanced and just out of this world.My favorites:-Fire broth spicy, but not overpowering, well balanced-Prawn Chile Fry A bit spicy, a bit crunchy and the shrimp were cooked to perfection-Chennai Chicken (this is my favorite dish on the menu and I could eat the entire dish myself) Well seasoned chicken, with a nice kick, crunchy cold salad to go with it and a wonderful yogurt sauce for dipping that is a nice touch-Manglorean Prawn Masala very tasty dish. A little sweet for Sandra, but I loved it. It&#39;s spicy, sweet and tart, shrimp were cooked to perfectionAs you may have noticed, I keep saying very well balanced and I think that&#39;s the key to this restaurant. They balance all of the flavors that hit your palate with spicy, sweet, crunchy and tart. Truly amazing dining experience and I can&#39;t wait to go again!

Everyone knows Indian food is delicious but Dosa really raises the bar! If you want to know what exquisite, upscale Indian cuisine is like, you&#39;ve come to the right place. The interior of the restaurant is impeccably designed with a minimal, elegant vibe. This restaurant would impress business clients as well as a first date.My husband surprised me for my birthday and invited about 12 guests which were seated behind a short wall so when we first walked in, I still thought it was just us on a dinner date. When I walked around the corner and saw a table full of familiar faces I was pleasantly surprised. I think it&#39;s great that the servers and staff were accommodating and enabled my husband to surprise me in this way. Service was superb and I felt like a queen the whole time I was there.First timers: be sure to try 1 or 2 of the dosas. They are amazing. I had the Paneer and Peas dosa and it was scrumptious! The prices are fair for what you get. Portions are on the large side, but there are small plates as well as many appetizers and salads to choose from. They also had plenty of vegetarian options for my veggie hubby.

I don&#39;t know if I was tired from Bay to Breakers or not, but I am not sure of my feelings towards Dosa. Fortunately for them, the boyfriend loved them so 4 stars!Had the Paper Dosa and Shrimp Wrap.Paper Dosa was HUGE and the spiced potatoes and lentil soup that came with it were YUMMY. the coconut and other spicy chutney were nice dips for change in taste.Shrimp wrap was pretty good! I liked the lightness but savoryness of the wrap.Had a party of 8 so there was a gratuity in our bill. Came out to $30 for the two of us. Not bad. Great atmosphere.

It could have been 5 stars had our main course arrived on time, but still highly recommend:We were dining after a movie right next door at the Kabuki.Our reservation was for 9:15, we were right on time, and our table was 100% ready.We were seated at the upstairs section, which was very warm initially, then they opened a window, eventually I needed to put my (sports) jacket back on, though my date didn&#39;t mind, and they&#39;d even asked us if it was too cool (we weren&#39;t the closest even to the window.)Our waiter was super attentive, and hyper knowledgeable. I like to ask for opinions , explaining we were going vegetarian, and we wanted a salad and some other starter, naming our initial choice for each. He went into detail on the three salads and we picked accordingly. He also gave an overview of the menu, which was helpful.I was disappointed that they said they pooled the tips, esp since our waiter really made our experience, but the other staff was constantly (and appropriately giving us new plates, silverware), perhaps a function of sitting in the relatively small upstairs.

Yes, the food is delicious, but the cocktails here are fantastic as well. The space is huge and the atmosphere is really nice and lively, but not incredibly loud. They seemed to have a descent sized bar area, so I might come back here again just to grab a drink. They have great options, but the Wry Rajah is something I will order every time. Its a whiskey-based drink with vermouth and cherry/mango flavors, but the bird&#39;s eye pepper is what really makes it special.The menu has a huge selection. It is different from any other Indian cuisine menu that I have seen. It actually took a little while to decide what I wanted because there was so much to choose from, but I was very pleased with what I ate (can&#39;t really go wrong with any of the Dosa *Paneer &amp; Peas is great!). They have a tasting menu for $35 a person and I think I will do that next time.Good FoodGood DrinksGood AtmosphereGood ServiceGood SelectionGood Time

Grab a spicy lunch here and get your weekend off to a LIVELY start! My bf and I found ourselves by Dosa on Fillmore today and decided to give it a whirl because we really enjoyed Dosa on Valencia.First off, hellllo SPACE! I have never been inside Dosa on Valencia and it makes Dosa on Fillmore feel and look like a walk-in closet. Whereas Dosa on Valencia is dim, intimate, and cozy, Dosa on Fillmore has soaring ceilings, floor-to-ceiling windows, and light, light, light! Add to this, a beautifully decorated interior to enjoy a Sunny SF day in the Fillmore.We started the meal with complimentary fried crisps/chips with fennel seeds. I&#39;m not sure what they were, but I would liken them to some kind of Indian &#34;tortilla chip&#34; but much thinner and lighter. Yum! I wanted another bowl!We split a Prawn &#34;Frankie&#34; (spiced sauce, marinated onions, cucumbers &amp; cilantro chutney wrapped in Roti, w egg-white brush) and a Spicy Mung Masala Dosa (mung lentil dosa with green chiles and spiced potatoes). The server noted these items were SPICY!And SPICY they were....but enjoyably so, allowing the complex flavors of the entrees to still sign through. The Prawn Frankie was similar to an Indian &#34;burrito&#34; (Curry Up Now lovers, rejoice!). Juicy prawns in a red fiery sauce wrapped up in a soft roti wrapper.The Spicy Mung Masala Dosa was also very tasty. The earthiness of the mung dosa was a tasty vehicle to enjoy the savory spiced potatoes and spicy chiles inside. I enjoyed experimenting with the tomato, fresh coconut chutney, and sambar (lentil dipping soup made with vegetables). I tried the Paper Masala (a thin, crispy, pliable dosa) at the Valencia location and prefer that because I like more texture in my food, but this was still very good.Spent about $30 for 2 people, including tip.

Five stars for the food, three stars for the service.First off, the food here is wonderful! Dosas are excellent and curries are great too (although I do find it a bit &#34;cheap&#34; that they charge for rice to go with a $20 curry).My only hesitation with this restaurant is the service. I&#39;ve been here twice and both times I&#39;ve experienced the same problem. In spite of this being a nice restaurant, they don&#39;t have their timinng down when it comes to serving courses. Last time I came here my husband and I ordered beers and apps upon sitting down. Our app arrived after 5 minutes, but still no beers. We ordered dinner (dosa and curry) and our dosa arrived 5 minutes later....but still no beer. After over 15 minutes we finally got our beers. However, the curry we ordered didn&#39;t arrive for another 15-20 minutes after the dosa arrived. I found it extremely strange that they served one main course 15-20 minutes before the other main course (effectively one of us was done eating before the other even got his meal).If you&#39;re coming here for dinner, stick to the bar and stick to the dosas or other quick food items. The curries are good, but both times we&#39;ve ordered them they arrived way after the other main courses, definitely not worth the awkwardly long wait.

The waiters are super nice but I do wish somebody would tell them the correct way to pronounce &#34;lassi.&#34;It is not supposed to rhyme with &#34;sassy.&#34;The service is caring and attentive - the waiter hovered over me, pointing out the coconut and tomato chutneys on my plate of spinach and fennel dosa... and the chai is actually pretty good, with a light fragrance of star anise, which is something you don&#39;t see every day.But -- feel free to call me an asshole -- it&#39;s just not as good as the food in India. The dosa was soggy, with no crunchy bits; and the &#34;sambar&#34; (really, a very thick and un-sambar-like dal) was two-dimensional, with plenty of high and low notes but no nuance. The taste of the &#34;sambar&#34; completely overwhelmed the fresh spinach and delicate fennel.OK so now I&#39;ve experienced Dosa. Next time, I&#39;ll go back to Tirupathi Bhima&#39;s.

Good food but not honest.We went there and paid 120 for 3 dosas, and 1 uttapam and 3 non alcoholic drinks. The manager came and said the tip was included. We were a party of 5.The part that sucks about this is that I didn&#39;t get to look at the bill. It was my fathers treat that evening and he didn&#39;t question and look at it properly. :( he then felt something was fishy. Out fault for not asking!Overall I feel like we got cheated and I don&#39;t trust this establishment. It&#39;s not a good feeling. This happened on sept 22nd so it has been a few weeks but this image of dosa has still stuck in my head.I just wanted to warn people out there when they dine at dosa on Fillmore.

Love this place! The sliders, the cocktails, and truffle dosas are truly one of a kind. The curries are decent, but slightly overpriced for what you get. The pappadum appetizers pre-dinner are also great and highly addicting. I&#39;ve already been twice and can&#39;t wait to go back again to try some more small plates, the chicken biryani, and the different dosas.

Outstanding.FOOD:App: Chutney Sampler. Standard, but delicious. Good portions and reasonably priced.Spiced Pumpkin Soup. Absolutely delicious. Tons of flavor. Perfect for a cold fall day.Lamb Chop: Order this and high five me later. Well worth the $$$ given that the plate is huge. It blended everything marvelously.SERVICE:Food came out at odd times, but I&#39;ll chalk that up to a kitchen mishap. The waitress was apologetic. She also knew her wine paring and nailed the malbec with the lamb. Bravo.

So this is where all the cool Pac Height yuppies go for Indian food huh...Fillmore St definitely needed a better Indian restaurant. The only option before Dosa opened was the $9.99 Indian Palace buffet a block away which may have been a liiittle bit too dirty for the Marc Jacobs wearing Pac Heights crowd.Not sure it&#39;s worth the one hour wait but the food is solid. Sipping my Gamay Noir from Andrew Lane at the bar wasn&#39;t so bad though.Dosa does Southern India cuisine very well. The Vegetable Curry was one of my favorites since it&#39;s mild and I heart veggies. The Coconut Prawn Curry was a bit on the coconut-y side for me. The Pepper Chicken Curry was okay but next time I would probably go with the Chicken and Eggplant Curry instead.For starters I definitely recommend the Somoasas &#34;North and South&#34;. I loved the South one with carmelized onions and veggies.Huh? No naan? No worries. They have poori which is this delicious light and airy piece of fried bread. Good but don&#39;t expect it to fill you up because it&#39;s 90% air.As for the Dosas I recommend the Cilantro and Mint Dosa. The lentil dipping soup and the chutneys were yummy. I love Dosas because it always turns into finger food.Dosa is a cool place for a nice dinner out with friends. I recommend making reservations!

I had been wanting to try this place for quite some time. The place is GORGEOUS.I had the paneer dosa and the uttapam. I was in a rush to catch a movie at the Kabuki so didn&#39;t have time to order several dishes. Everything I ordere was awesome. The dishes lend themselves to be shared so I would HIGHLY recommend it as a date place.

I&#39;m a big fan of Udipi cuisine generally, and was keen to see how they had put a spin on it. We ordered dishes with the most unusual ingredients - truffle dosa and sunchoke uttapam. Both were excellent, though the uttapam could have been thicker.The cocktails were also very innovative and quite delicious.The one disappointment was the coffee. It was tepid and not nearly as frothy as good South Indian filter coffee should be.

Get the rack of lamb it&#39;s really good. Good place to eat before the movies, if you like ethnic food this a great place to try. The lamb was great, the drinks were nice and strong, and the service was good, lots of food to choose from and if you have a question the staff knows their stuff, definitely going here again before going to a movie at the Kabuki.

I now know I prefer Northern Indian food. Dosa does Southern. The beer list is small, but good. The decor is interesting and the vibe is fun. The food is a step below okay. I dined with 3 others and none of us loved our food. I didn&#39;t like anything about mine other than the Raita. I ordered the Paneer &amp; Peas dosa. It tasted like a bland egg and cheese crepe from a diner. I tasted the masala dosa and it wasn&#39;t much better.As other reviews have noted -- no Naan. Rather than naan they serve something called Bhatura which is &#34;oversized, soft, puffy white bread&#34;. It&#39;s bigger than a basketball until you pierce it with a fork and it deflates. It was bland, greasy and reminded me of Elephant Ears from a Midwestern state fair.I would only eat here again if I weren&#39;t hungry and was in the mood to drink my dinner.

The Service was horrible. We were made to wait an entire hour even though we had a confirmed reservation. They did not have a table ready for us and made us wait 45 minutes at the bar. When enquired about the table after waiting so long, the waitress blatantly lied saying that since the entire party is not here we cannot seat you. Why was this not informed to us upon arrival or even when making the reservation. The most horrible service you can ever get if you waited for an hour before being seated.

The coconut milk was not overpowering.My favorite is the Batsman: Gin, Darjeeling tea cordial, lemon juice and ginger beer over ice with a mint sprig..so drinkable that I can easily have a pitcher of it!If you have a hard time getting into Dosa for dinner....stop by for a delicious cocktail!

I&#39;ve been wanting to try this place for a while now and was super excited once I was seated. Unfortunately I sat there waiting for an extensive amount of time before my waiter decided to graciously appear at our table... but over the course of our dinner his personality and patience with explaining the menu to me made up for it.On to the food - it was good, not great. The curry duck and dosa we ordered were alright; nothing I would ever crave or found very exciting. I don&#39;t even have much to say about it... that&#39;s how memorable it was. We ordered a scallop appetizer... $16 for 3 scallops and it came out overdone/ rubbery. For $5 a bite... I don&#39;t expect it to be exquisite I just ask that it not have the texture of a rubberband.The interior was lovely and you don&#39;t come out reeking of Indian food.For the price and based on all the reviews I expected a bit more.

I heard so much about the dosas here, and my friend and I wanted a quick dinner before going to Yoshi&#39;s jazz night. We went there right when it opened for dinner and got seated fairly quickly.The service was good, though might have been too quick and attentive because it was a bit weird when the server immediately asked us what we wanted (haha so much pressure to decide on dinner).We ordered two masala dosa (the spicy basil one and the traditional with chutney). Both were good and the three dipping sauces (the soothing coconut one was really good) complimented everything well. However, for the price to quality, I wasn&#39;t too impressed. I love the dosas and masalas I used to eat in Berkeley for half the price, and those had so much more flavor.

This is a really awesome place to have a meal. We came here for lunch, and was very impressed with the food and the surroundings. The restaurant is very cavernous (big high ceilings and windows). We shared the vada pav (veggie sliders) which was really tasty [and I like eating meat] with the onions having a nice touch; chennal chicken (nice dish), and the mysore masala (mild but good). Overall, a solid 4.0 stars!!

Does not have million choices on menu, but keeps with good minimum choices.Service- handling is done very well even during bigger crowds.Does not display that elitist behavior for being in a posh area. also clean.Location- bit away from the usual buzz area.

Came here with a group of six before a movie and they were magically able to seat us without a reservation. Service was efficient and friendly and they were able to make great suggestions.One person in our group really liked the drinks and they were definitely strong and floral in a good way. We probably could have gotten away with less food but everything was generally good.Since it is called DOSA half of us decided to get some version of it. The chicken buriyani was nice and creamy but the dosa&#39;s were definitely the best part. Sauces were good and the &#39;bread&#39; was tangy and interesting - a great accompaniment to the spicy fillings.We loved the giant puffed bread, bhaturra i think, that we shared as an appetizer and left full and happy.Will come back to try other stuff!

No surprise that the sister location of le original Dosa on Valencia is a superb establishment. Took the family for a late dinner (only reservation available was 830 and up) and the place was packed and still bustling when we left around 11pm. Beautiful space with a great loft dining area on the second level.The Dosas are an obvious must try at any point of a visit and we each opted for the pre fixe menu which included a mini dosa course. The salads and dosas were so fresh and delicious. The mung and masal dosas are both fantastic. I had the vegetable curry with rice and could not have been happier with the spice, flavors, and portion. The lamb curry dish was said to be very good.The best dessert is one of the newest and a must try: the sesame gelato (made in house as are all of their desserts). Great staff and wonderful vibe.Everyone at our table couldn&#39;t stop talking about going back.$25 corkage feeGreat cocktails

I am fully aware that Dosa does not in any way rhyme with Rhonda....however, &#34;help me dosa, help help me dosa&#34; is what popped into this little head of mine as i began writing this review.expansive and pretty dining room....subpar service (minus 1)....and a 40 tasting menu...YUM.the chicken appetizer was spicy deliciousness and the dosa...ooooh delicious delicious dosa...i had the spring one (yum) and also the potato one (super yum)....followed it up by lamb curry (absolutely unappealing to look at but delicious) and coconut sorbet was a refreshing and light end to a delicious meal.

The Dosa looks so big you don&#39;t think you can finish it, but it&#39;s absolutely so amazing that it is actually quite easy. You also have the option of the &#34;paper&#34; Dosa, which is apparently thinner...The first time I came here with my sister the FIRST time I moved away from San Francisco, and my last trip was shortly before I left the second time. Once dinner, once lunch.My first experience consisted of being seated at the community table, where I was slightly annoyed at the group of men trying to have a full out conversation with us. &#34;I&#39;m moving in 2 days and my sister and I are here having a constructive conversation, excuse me.&#34; They didn&#39;t listen, but I guess that&#39;s what you get when there are two blondes that look like twins in San Francisco (a rarity which I am not used to, since I hail from the Midwest), combined with the amount of alcohol they had consumed.My last experience at Dosa was with a friend of mine who helped me put my bed frame together. It&#39;s really quite a shame, because I ended up moving out of that apartment just 2-3 weeks later. Oh well. Anyway, we both ordered the lunch special- a beverage, salad, and Dosa for something along the lines of $12 per person. So delicious... one of those lunches you could actually handle and go back to work without being completely worthless all afternoon.I love Dosa. The environment, the high ceilings, the service. I&#39;ll miss you, Dosa.

Elegant, loungy atmosphere.Incredible service!!!We walked into this place at the start of the dinner shift which can certainly be a time to get scattered service, but not with this crew. They had a calm demeanor. Each one. The hostess, bartender, food runner and busser were equally hip, friendly and warm.Dahi Vada - lentil dumplings topped with organic yogurt, tamarind and mint. Makes me wonder what other incredible treats I have been missing! Yum!!Next up - Samosas - they were served as a duo- one from the North, one from the South. An incredible tour without leaving the comfort of our table....We ordered a classic dosa. Hmmmmm they really made this perfectly. The combination of aromatic spices danced on this dish!Our entire meal was vegetarian however, if you are a meat lover, the table next to us raved to the server about the lamb chops. He said &#34;they were the best he ever had&#34;.Love this place! The atmosphere, knowledgeable service team, great wine by the glass list and food prep makes for a new favorite!It&#39;s restaurants like this that make me wanna go out, everyday, for all three meals!

Very poorly coordinated. First, they told us the wait will be 30 minutes. We ended up waiting for 1.5 hours. Seemed like they didn&#39;t keep of track of wait list. Food was pricey and not that great.

For at least a few weeks now I&#39;ve been passing by Dosa on Fillmore, just blatantly staring at the customers eating what looks to be delicious southern Indian food. Oh who am I kidding, I&#39;m staring at the light fixtures. I&#39;m secretly a moth, which probably explains why I run into sliding glass doors a lot.But last Monday I called up a friend and said that, since I was famished and couldn&#39;t walk more than a few steps from my car without passing out, we should totally check out Dosa. Being the gentleman he is, he obliged and we met at the bar. It was pretty obvious that he and I had absolutely no idea what to order, because we&#39;re used to french and italian food, and this is *clearly* not either of them. Of course, he HAS to ask the bartender why a French wine has a German name (the Gerwuzientalksdjfalkfjder). Whatever, I&#39;m having the cab.We decide to get the samosas, the steamed rice ball thingie, a cheese dosa and one that starts with an M that is third down on the menu...amazing I can remember shit like that but NOT the name itself.The samosas and the sauces were delicious--get them. The steamed puffed rice was wonderful but then when the dosa came out, I expect them to have different sauces--they didn&#39;t. All came with the tomato chutney, the coconut chutney, and the broth type looking thing. It was all wonderful, but I like a little variety with my sauces. So four stars. My friend kept saying the cheese one looked like an enchilada. Apparently, he ALSO has taco bell on the brain. What is it these days with wanting taco bell and then going to a fancy restaurant instead!?And negative stars for me putting my umbrella on the stool and waiters kept apologizing for knocking it over. It&#39;s my fault that I did that! Please stop saying sorry!

Great ambience and good food! It&#39;s one of the fancier Indian restaurants in San Francisco. There is generally a long wait during busy hours and so it&#39;s highly recommended to make a reservation in advance. I liked the vada paav (sliders) and of course dosas.

Definitely a classy and unique place. I&#39;d go back for more.I met a couple friends here before heading out to French Tuesday&#39;s and found the menu very interesting. I&#39;ve eaten a lot on Indian food but wasn&#39;t quite sure what a Dosa was or what was the thing to order. The menu and staff was very helpful in getting us oriented. The Dosa&#39;s were actually very good as well.The ambiance and atmosphere is great to. Interesting and fancy decor but not to pretentious or cliquie. Overall I&#39;d give it 4 stars but 5 stars for finding a type of restaurant that hasn&#39;t already been done in San Francisco.

If you want dosa, this is the place to come. I have never been disappointed by their dosas or uttapams. Sometimes they have too many customers so when the dosa comes to you, seems like it had been sitting for a bit, so not too too crispy, but still delicious.Key to have a good dining experience:- Must make a reservation: walk-ins are available but be prepared to wait for an hour at least (staff is super nice about it but still, waiting for an hour is sometimes too much)- Just get the dosas or uttapams. I find the other main dish just ok

We went here last night to celebrate my parents&#39; wedding anniversary. From all the reviews on Yelp, magazines, foodies&#39; blogs, etc., I had pretty high expectations for DOSA, though I already knew it was far from being authentic South Indian cuisine.Don&#39;t get me wrong, I really enjoyed my dinner and loved the ambiance, the menu and the presentation...but the food didn&#39;t really please me as much as I had expected it to. Hmm, I guess I&#39;ll just say...the food was good and the compositions were quite unique, but nothing really stood out taste-wise. The curries and sauces were on the thicker and creamier side, but they were still very flavourful; the lemon-rice was too strong (sour) but the coconut rice was delicious; the dosas were tasty and appetizing, though they all sound similar; the desserts we had were just mediocre (read: not enough sugar and cream);3 of us did the tasting-course and these were the things we chose:Starters:1. Crab Vada2. Cochin Calamari3. Paneer &amp; Romaine SaladMini Dosas:1. Spring2. Spinach &amp; Fennel (x2)Entrees:1. Peppered Chicken2. South Indian Lamb Kofta3. Kerala Fish Moilee (this was good)Desserts:1. Chocolate Chai Gelato2. Passion fruit tart with coconut tapioca3. RasmalaiMy dad opted for regular dining and got the Sweet Spicy Scallops for starts and the Manglorean Prawn Masala for main. I tried a little bit of both and thought they were better than the items I had chosen. We also ordered two Mango Lassi&#39;s and I heard they were yummy - not too thick and not too sweet.The best part of the meal was the pappadams - they were crispy, thin and delicious. More spices would have been perfect though.The service was excellent; attentive, friendly and efficient staff.Since I really liked the atmosphere of DOSA and the food is decent, I definitely see myself going back there.

Plus a half. This was the closest I have come to a five star meal, in my limited Yelping and dining experience. I was extremely happy with our server. We sat at the social table, as the wait for a table was at least 45 minutes. What a great space, first of all. Hip and classy at the same time. Back to our server, he could tell right away that we were first timers. We perused the menu, and he helped out with explanations about certain things. We got two starters, three if you count the fire broth. Our meal was a dosa and an uttapam. Wow, that pretty much sums it up. I am neither a food critic, nor a writer, so I won&#39;t go into awesome detail about the textures or flavor pairings or spice or anything like that. What I will say is, go here now.PSOne of the reviews on here complained about the server saying that he took a horrible picture of them and didn&#39;t check in to see if it was an ok shot...Are you flippin kidding me? That has nothing to do with his job or the level of service that you should be reviewing. And who the frick asks their server to take their picture?PPSWe, as I said earlier, were at the social table. Turns out that the man at the table across from us was the director of The Cove. Holy shit Miss Agnes, what a trip...got to talk with him about his life and times and I didn&#39;t even know until my wife told me later who he was

I recently met a professional food critic and the conversation made me realize how deficit most of my restaurant &#34;reviewing&#34; is. A fair review requires a good concept of &#34;what good looks like&#34; and not just &#34;what I like.&#34; With this concept in mind, I realize I am more or less a hack at this, but I will try my best to comment on Dosa on Fillmore.The highlight of the meal was the coconut basmanti rice which was semisweet and perfectly cooked. I also enjoyed my before dinner cocktail which was the ginger ante - tangy with ginger.The fried fish starter was mediocre - more or less fish sticks accompanied by three condaments: a mild green yogurt sauce, a spicy chilly sauce and chutney of chili and cilantro. The chutney was chopped individual vegetable with no cohesive identity.My mango prawn curry dish was yawn-worth. The sauce had a good flavor, but it didn&#39;t really &#34;jump out&#34; and was the exact opposite of the chutney. In other words it was an amalgam of flavors with no real standout of high notes and lows.The Nilgiri Chicken Korma was my shared dish and was good, but felt a lot like what it really was...a curry stew prepared ahead and heated for serving.On service; it was only adequate. I&#39;m not an Indian cuisine expert, but I was surprised to find no naan (traditional flat bread) on the menu. Maybe this is because its Southern Indian cuisine - I don&#39;t know and I didn&#39;t feel compelled to inquire on this point. After we spent 15 minutes pouring over the menu multiple times, the server should have been astute enough to ask if we had dined there before. We asked enough questions to figure it out, but it was more work than it needed to be.Finally for value...two drinks, two glasses of wine, two entrees and bread: $120 including tip. Hmmmm. The overall sensation of the meal was that the plates were prepared for us, but the meals were not.

I took a night off from Yelping. A savvy friend recommended for a special date night we go to Dosa on Fillmore for dinner followed by a cozy balcony level movie across the street at Sundance Kabuki Cinema. It was our anniversary in October, and since I&#39;m the planner of the two of us, I made reservations on Opentable and bought our movie tickets online as well.It was hard to pick what to order because everything looked tempting. I love that they use local, organic and sustainable ingredients as much as possible. We ordered the tasting menu so we could try a good variety. Mr. L had his tasting menu with the wine pairing and I ordered a Peony cocktail (Right Gin, hibiscus masala nectar, coconut milk, lime, orange flower water, birds eye chili, served up).I had a fresh corn soup, vegetable dosa, halibut curry, and coconut sorbet. This was one of the best meals we&#39;ve had and the Peony has become a new favorite cocktail. We&#39;re both fans of Indian food, and didn&#39;t know it could be this vibrant, light, fresh, and bold.Since it was our wedding anniversary, I squelched my impulses to photograph the restaurant and our food. It was a special occasion and my husband deserved to be out to dinner with his loving wife, not the obsessive Yelper who would ask him to wait while she photographed his food. As a result, we had a relaxing meal without him rolling his eyes at my Yelp antics. I didn&#39;t need to ask how many stars he&#39;d give this restaurant - this is a slam-dunk 5 star swanky joint. The bright flavors and exotic cocktails leave me yearning to go back.Service was seamless and prompt. The only thing I would&#39;ve preferred was if the waiter had recommendations when we asked. He said everything was excellent, and perhaps he spoke the truth.It was a memorable meal and afterward we walked across the street to see a movie on the &#34;21 and over&#34; balcony level of the Kabuki where there are little tables in the movie theatre and you can drink wine with your movie. I wonder how I&#39;ll top this for our next anniversary.

Dosa is a fabulous place for dining - to go on a date or with a group of friends/family.My absolute favorite thing about my meal at Dosa was the Rasmalai (sweet cheese dessert).My least favorite part of the dinner was our server - who was deliberately ignoring my friends and I. This place deserves a 5 star rating for the whole experience (ambiance, decor, on time seating, and tastiness of food), but unfortunately the service was not on par.

We finally came here on a double date with my best friend and her boyfriend who were visiting from NYC on a Saturday night. Not having made reservations in advance, we ended up with a 10pm seating.The decor of the restaurant is wonderful, the perfect combination of classy, exotic, Indian. You could tell the light fixtures, the mosaic tiled bar, the adornments and even the textures of the wall were all carefully selected.Dosa is unique because it is South Indian cuisine and as my colleague told me that most Indian restaurants in the US are north Indian, Dosa is different in this way.We ordered a variety of dishes family style to share:1) crab vadas-small crab cakes accompanied by a tamarind and cilantro sauce. this tasted good but the portions were just tiny.2) chennai chicken-this sounded better on the menu than it tasted on the palate.3) duck spinach masala and paneer-the spinach sauce is quite heavy and it didn&#39;t compliment the paneer as well as I thought it would given the fact that I love saag paneer.4) pepper chicken-advertised as &#39;falls off the bone&#39; this it did not. the flavor was good but we thought it was going to be much more tender.5) masala dosa-GREAT! if you come here, definitely order this. a crepe like sheet encased with potatoes, spice, peas, and a variety of dipping sauces, this was truly delicious.6) peas and paneer dosa-also very tasty, this one is like a filled crepe and had the same sauces.Definitely order the dosas if you come here. They were great. Everything else we just thought were average. On the way out, we also a dish called &#34;South Indian Moons&#34; which is an assortment of Uttapams. That dish looked tasty!If we ever come back, we will definitely try that.

This is my first Indian food experience (we have gone three times now) and do not have anything to compare Dosa to. However, we love their food, the atmosphere is great, and the service is impeccable. Glad we found it and we look forward to adding Dosa to our restaurant rotation.

Well - in short, it&#39;s a place that&#39;s trying to be what it is not. The setting and ambience are definitely good, and the servers try to be at their best, but I couldn&#39;t care for all the hype if all your genuine attempts still fall short. I tried the Rava Dosa, which is my barometer for how good you are at dosas, and it was a 3/5 - which is, not too bad. Next was the Hyderabadi Chicken Biryani - which was not even a 1/5. Too salted, no biryani flavor, et al. All this would have been still fine if the servers hadn&#39;t taken over 5 minutes to re-fill my glass with wine, as well as just taken the glass away after 2 drinks without caring to ask if I&#39;d like some more. So, overall, meh. There are tons of better Indian cuisine options in the bay area without the pretentions and hype that this place fails to deliver on.

Dosa on Fillmore is a beautiful restaurant that serves straight ahead indian food. They do a solid job and serve some dishes that I don&#39;t see at restraunts often but remember from my childhood.I think their execution, flavors, service and decor all make for a great experience.What drags the score down for me is that Dosa bills itself (both in hype and price) as much more. This isn&#39;t your corner indian joint, it shouldn&#39;t be serving just good straight ahead indian food. With all the pomp and circumstance (and $$$), I expected the food to be off the charts with creativity (like Aziza does with Morroccan food out in the Richmond).I was expecting Dosa to push the envelope a bit by utilizing indian flavors in new and creative dishes. Instead they just wow diners who&#39;ve never seen Baturas before. The only place they managed to do anything creative was with their cocktails. The cocktails were great and were unlike anything I&#39;d had before.Dosa is a place to go for solid indian food when you feel like dressing up and not much more. Hopefully the chef will take a cue from Aziza and step up her/his culinary game to match the epic service/decor.

Went there with my mom and girlfriend for my birthday dinner. Awesome, yummy food! Had the chennai chicken for starters (always my fav). Dinner consisted of the Biryani (the best in the bay area), Paneer dosa and Tamil lamb (lamb left a lot to be desired, was just ok), with generous sides of lemon rice (yum). Overall I loved it!We had a Asian waitress who was ok for the most part. The thing that irked me was when she dropped off a check without asking for desserts!! Fyi- It was a non busy weekday night around 9pm or so. I understand that you have to turn your tables to make more money, but it was my birthday night and I wanted to finish of our good food with some sweet dessert. I left irked.

We heard about this place after it was featured in Check Please Bay Area. We were there for lunch on the weekend with couple of friends. Initially I was not sure if this place would have authentic Indian food. I was totally impressed after I tried their food.We initially ordered four to five small plate dishes like Vada, Samosa, Idiappom, and Madras chicken and all these dishes were very good. We then ordered four different types of dosa to share. We picked masala, rava, paper and uthapam. The waiter was great In helping us pick popular dishes. All of us were impressed by the taste, quality of ingredients used, the way food was presented. We finished off the lunch with a order of India chai and Coffee.I would highly recommend this place if you are in the city and near the Fillmore area near Japan town. The location is great to walk around after the lunch or dinner. It was not crowded during lunch and we could sit for couple of hours to socialize with friends. They also have a full bar and they make some good cocktail.

A South Indian Restaurant with an ambiance, I&#39;d take it.We ordered Chennai Chicken, which comes with a yogurt dipping sauce, absolutely perfect with the spicy chicken. Either the portion was small or it was super yummy for us to have devoured it, in no time.I got the Paneer Dosa. I struggle with the fact that Dosa&#39;s have filling right in the middle so most of the time I have work my way from the middle to the edges. I was happy at Dosa, since the Paneer Dosa was sliced up neatly in pieces, not messy for finicky people like me. Loved the Sambhar and the Coconut Chutney it was served with.My friend got the Chana Bhatura, incredible in taste and rich in flavor.The ambiance is great and the staff is very attentive, I need to be back more often to try other entrees. They do have an interesting menu.

Dosa on Fillmore is incredibly beautiful: open, airy, gorgeous chandeliers, and rich colors to match the hustling and bustling atmosphere.We had once attempted to do a walk-in, and the hostess smiled and told us that it was no problem, the wait will be about an hour. Um, nevermind.This time I made a reservation for a Monday night and it was still packed. Prices are as reasonable as the location on Valencia. Dosas are all about $10. And they are quite large and very filling.I also ordered a chai that was really delicious.Service was very efficient and fast. About two seconds after we ordered our dosas, the dishes came. Some magic must have happened in the kitchen, or they are mind-readers and figured out what we wanted before we actually ordered.Anyway, I am sure Dosa will stay busy for a long time to come. And if I ever want to come back, I better plan it well ahead of time.

I was SO WRONG about this place. I&#39;ve avoided Dosa because I hate paying $$$ for Indian food I can make at home. I feel the same way about paying more than $10 for spaghetti, so I rarely eat at Italian restaurants.I can not make any of the food served at Dosa, it is unique and very delicious. A friend and I go for Sunday Brunch, I get the Spring Dosa and the Corn and Pepper Coconut soup which is so delicious and distinct it would take me years to describe it. The weird thing is that their chai sucks. The service is impeccable and the decor and ambiance is gorgeous and serene. This entire time I was missing out. Hopefully I learned my lesson.P.S. I am not sure of the dress code. When we go for Sunday Brunch, I am wearing my gym clothes but everyone else is dressed nice. There are many people wearing beautiful saris. I suggest NOT wearing gym clothes (but I have no shame so I&#39;m not embarrassed).

I was very impressed with Dosa. I walked in and the first thing I thought was &#34;wow, this place is pretty for an Indian restaurant.&#34; I mean, sure, I have seen pretty Indian restaurants before, but they hadn&#39;t had the reputation for good food. I was very excited to see what Dosa dished out.In order to get a reservation for 7, we had to be there at 6:30. Even 4 days beforehand, there was no way to eat later. We walked in at 6:30 and the place was already packed with an older crowd. Every table in the fairly full restaurant was taken.We were walked upstairs to a nice table by the window. It was a bit load but pleasant. The waiter was nice and brought out water right away. I ordered a Bollywood Hills ($9) which was made with saffron vodka. Just that description (although the rest went on for ages) sold me on the drink. It knocked me off my feet though. Before my dinner arrives, I was already happy and giggly.To start, my friends and I had multiple starters which I can&#39;t remember. The chicken stood out as really great. It came with a yogurt dipping sauce that brought out the flavours of the fried chicken. I was sad to see it disappear.I had the paneer and peas Dosa (around $12). It was fantastic although a bit on the heavy side. It tasted so good though that, even though I was totally stuffed at after about half, I cleaned my plate. The spices and the cheese just made such a perfect taste that I couldn&#39;t help myself.I really want to come back here soon. I remember staring at the menu going &#34;I want EVERYTHING!&#34; so I want to go back and see what else can make my taste buds tingle.

I appreciate the vast and varied menu and the waiters&#39; willingness to help you through it. We tried something from nearly all of their categories, as it was hard to settle for one. The food itself was okay. I was expecting a bit more, both in terms of flavor and quantity. It was an enjoyable dinner, bit not one that I&#39;ll be rushing to repeat.

I went here yesterday with my husband a few friends of ours who were visiting from out of town. A few months back, we had gone to Dosa on Valencia and thought to give this location a try as we really enjoyed the food and service at Valencia.The service was extremely poor. The management seemed to have checked in and taken care of seating us and making sure our orders were taken on time, however attention to details from our server was highly lacking. He placed the initial plates of papadum at our table and never brought out the tamarind and chutney sauces to accompany it. We looked around to locate him, however it seemed he was too busy to even drop by and check on that detail. Additionally, I had ordered a chai at the start of our meal and I had finished the chai during the course of my meal.When we finally decided to order dessert, I requested the server that I would like another chai and he took my cup and came back with more chai in the same old cup I had used previously in the beginning. To make it look even worse, my opened sugar packet and used spoon was STILL left on the saucer when he returned with the &#34;new&#34; cup of chai. My friends and I had a good laugh at this in the moment, but it was terrible to receive an old cup I had used previously and not be given a new cup with the chai I had reordered. It just looked really bad.I then requested another individual to kindly take back the cup and give me a new chai with a new cup and spoon. He did. Throughout the closure of our meal, while we were finishing dessert, the bus boys would interrupt and cut through us to wipe the table (while we were seated) and clear plates. A few times of doing this was fine, but it happened several times at the end when we were finishing dessert and we felt rushed and interrupted too often. They didn&#39;t even say &#34;excuse me&#34; when reaching their hands between us to take plates or clear/wipe the table.I was highly disappointed with the service and we won&#39;t be returning to this location. It&#39;s a good thing the food is good, so we&#39;ll be taking our business to Valencia where the service was more professional and detailed.

My friends and I were eager to try the new Dosa location shortly after it opened. The restaurant is huge - much bigger than the Mission location - with really high ceilings. My friend didn&#39;t particularly like the space (she thinks it has deviated too far from the Mission location), but I liked it. It&#39;s spacious and feels relaxed.We had the lentil dumplings to start (which was probably my favorite) and also ordered the paneer and pea dosa, chef&#39;s selection of five uttapams and the lamb curry. Everything was good with lots of great dipping sauces, though the lamb curry was my least favorite as it stood out the least.Our service was good overall, though it was a bummer that they didn&#39;t identify the uttapams for us when they delivered them. It seems like one of the purposes of getting the chef&#39;s selection of uttapams is so that you can try different ones to find your favorite uttapam. So I did have a favorite; sadly, I don&#39;t know which one it was!Dosa is relatively priced compared to the other options on Fillmore.

I live for their white truffle masala dosa. It&#39;s vegan, gluten-free, and really, really good.If you have dietary restrictions, ask the host for their special menu. They created an incredibly helpful chart version that indicates nut, dairy, egg, and wheat-free menu options.

Dosa on Fillmore is definitely not your typical Dosa place because of the chic atmosphere but the food surprisingly tasted authentic even their chai. We tried the paneer dosa and lamb kofta, which were delicious. I really enjoyed the fast service.

Indian restaurant for white people. Food was plain. Service was plain. You can get the same stuff or better at a Mom and Pops place for half the price. Prices are ridiculous. If you&#39;re into the free-range pretentious yuppie over-priced Whole-Foods experience, this is your place. There was absolutely no charm, ambience, nothing. Never again. And geez, at the very least, teach the waiters how to pronounce the damn names of the food!

I think 4star with ~1550 reviews explains it pretty much. You haven&#39;t tried dosa if you have never been to DOSA. Flavors are interesting &amp; appetizers are mind blowing(dahi vada &amp; fried Idli). If you&#39;re not a dosa fan , try uttapams. The one with panner is nice and the sambhar is best. The aroma of sambhar gives you a feeling of being in India and having home made food.

Finally checked out this place after all the raving. It&#39;s crowded as heck, parking was a mess (some foodie truck event in J town) and luckily we had rezzies. The decor inside is beautiful, especially from the top level. The waiter was a little pretentious and offered little when asked about some of the meals. He explained that Dosa were easy to share, saying that they were individually wrapped. It turns out they&#39;re huge crepes with filling in the center. Everything was quite tasty, but be warned that this food is spicy. I got a mango lassi to wash it down, but the lassi was so thick it was difficult to suck through a straw.The desserts were quite tasty as well, coconut ice cream and raspberry sherbet. Can&#39;t complain about the Madras coffee.The food, the decor and the vibe the restaurant fit the area, with Kabuki next door. It&#39;s a place where you go when you have money to drop. I prefer for the food, not the decor to be the focus of dinner.

I love Indian food, but my husband isn&#39;t crazy about it. It took a little convincing, but ultimately we were both totally thrilled with our meal.We ordered the tasting menu, had a couple drinks, and dessert. I loved the coconut curry corn soup, my dosa, the vegetable curry, and had a blueberry sorbet that transformed the color of my mouth while also being delicious.Service was good, ambiance was exciting... the price was what you&#39;d expect in SF. Best of all, my husband has a new appreciation for Indian food!

This is the first time I&#39;ve had dosa, and the only way I can describe it is mashed potatoes in a crepe. It&#39;s a weird combination in my mind but works deliciously. To start off, we got the chennai chicken, which was a slightly spicy fried goodness. Then, we had the duck vindaloo and white truffle masala dosa. They were both good, but overpriced and overhyped. In addition, the food did not sit well in our stomach that night and the day after :/.

8 people eating family style = a great way to try a lot of dishes! :D I love Indian food, so i was really excited to try this place. I never tried a Dosa before so it was a great treat!We walked in with no reservation and our wait was only about 30 min (we all expected a lot longer especially for a group our size and it was a long weekend. The time flew by while many of us grabbed a beer from the bar, admired the beautiful decorations, and just chatted a bit.Everything we ate was great and I would definitely go back again if i am in the area!Dosas:(all of them were served with coconut chutney, tomato chutney and sambar, a lentil dipping soup. *my favorite was the sambar)Paper Masala - Thin, pliable and crispy variation, served with spiced Indian potatoes, onions, and cashew nuts*of the four Dosas we tried this was my favorite one!Spinach and Fennel Pooriyal Spiced, diced filling with spinach and fennel stemsSpring Masala Dosa combined with fresh vegetables including peas, carrots, cabbage and red onionPaneer and Peas Dosa filled with spiced and shredded farmer&#39;s cheese, lightly grilled, peas, and cilantroEntrees:Channa Bhatura Chickpea (garbanzo) Marsala served with an over sized, soft, puffy wheat bread or vegan poori*of the two entrees I liked this one better. Super flavorful and the puffy wheat break was about the size of a person&#39;s head!Chicken Korma Boneless, organic, cauliflower, peas, coconut milk, fennel, mild (we got it with the plain Basmati Rice)

You&#39;d be crazy not to order a dosa here.I love a good masala dosa (check my profile if you don&#39;t believe), and they certainly know how to make a great one here. I went with a big group, so we were able to split a few other things as well. Some other favorites include the chicken biryani, vegetable curry, spicy grilled octopus, goat cheese salad (lil&#39; heat in the dressing!). With the dosa, this was just the right amount of food for four hungry girls.The cocktails? Ya-hum. Order the one with Darjeeling and gin. Trust.Atmosphere? it&#39;s just plain gorgeous. Very modern, with a high chic factor.I&#39;d skip dessert. I didn&#39;t mind the coconut custard cake, but the ras malai was pretty bad. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s Dosa&#39;s fault, but it was my fault for not remembering exactly what ras malai tastes like and convincing everyone to order it. There&#39;s a reason why India isn&#39;t known for its desserts, and ras malai isn&#39;t usually a favorite of mine to begin with.

Nice decor in a huge building. Our waitress was friendly and helpful- a vegan menu was perfect for my wife. The food was incredible and reasonably priced. We went with the dosa and uttapam, avoiding the more traditional Indian fare. But the table next to us ordered curries and they smelled delicious. We will be going back for moe

The very best Southern Indian dining experience in SFO. Excellent service. The 3 course summer sampler is indescribable...exotic...rich...stunning. If you love curry, chile, range fed, and all organic, look no further. Many beers and wines, and exotic mixed drinks. This is mostly a locals and business travelers place to meet and indulge...excellent choice after a long day in the most beautiful city in the world!

Woah!Let me be straight up honest here, you can order anything off the menu and it&#39;s excellent. Extremely high quality ingredients &amp; dishes have numerous subtle well balanced flavors.The specialty house drinks are also fantastic. Ginger Ante and the coconut one were spectacular.The only downside is the price. This place is not cheap--but I knew what I was getting into when I walked in so I&#39;m not going to take away any stars.

Our 2 person party dashed from the Yelp Elite event and ventured through the steep incline of Fillmore street (Did you know part of the sidewalk has stairs on it? I really don&#39;t know jack about certain parts of SF.). We were practically gasping for air once we arrived here to meet with friends.My partner in crime ordered a bottle of champagne (like a boss) to share with some of the group while I ordered Chennai Chicken and samosas to split. Felt the kick from the chicken and the samosas had a flavorful blend of veggies and spiced potatoes. I don&#39;t have Indian cuisine very often, so it&#39;s crucial that I pick something good when I do. Dos thumbs up, Dosa.

If we didn&#39;t have to wait a good 5-10 minutes just to be greeted by our waitress and if they didn&#39;t get our orders switched up, I would have given this place 5 stars.We had 8:45pm reservations before seeing the 9:55pm showing of Harry Potter in 3D over at the theater across the street. We showed up a little bit early and ended up waiting about 5-10 minutes to be seated at our table. Walking in, this place is super trendy. Past the plain wooden door, a fancy chandelier greets you at the hostess&#39; podium. Tall ceilings draw your eyes up to the balcony area that was reserved for a private party at the time. Then your eyes immediately go to the expansive dining area filled with hip bar seating, circular tables for groups, and smaller tables for more intimate dining.Once we sat down, we looked over the menu for a good 5-10 minutes, put them down on the table, and then waited another 5-10 minutes to be greeted by our waitress. Meanwhile, we got not just one, but TWO glasses of water EACH! How did the guy put down additional glasses when he saw that we already had water?! A little miscommunication right there. When the waitress noticed this, she picked up the glasses on her way to the kitchen. Anyways, my friend ordered a drink, the grilled calamari appetizer to share, and the Paneer &amp; Peas Dosa (since according to other fellow Yelpers, the Dosa is the thing to get!). I ordered the Spring Dosa and decided to save my alcohol consumption for the movies :)In lieu of bread, they presented us with these things that looked a lot like tortilla chips but were lighter and airier. I forgot what they were called, but they&#39;re mighty tasty! Then our grilled calamari came out. It was a simple dish, but pretty good. When our entrees came out, they mixed up our orders and put mine in front of my friend and my friend&#39;s in front of me. We didn&#39;t realize this until we bit into it... Fortunately, we like to share food and just switched plates after that (also, fortunately, none of us have any food allergies). Since neither of us had dined there before, the guy who served us our food gave us the suggestion of how to eat the Dosa (dip it in the large bowl first and then in either of the chutney&#39;s). Both of us preferred the green chutney, and in fact, I didn&#39;t like dipping it in the large bowl of sauce first... Just the green chutney was perfect. It was very refreshing. My friend&#39;s Paneer &amp; Peas Dosa was really good with the spiced cheese, but I also liked the lightness of my Spring Dosa. The crepe-like carbohydrate was the perfect thickness as to not be overpowering of the filling. I had never had Indian food like this, so it was a great experience.Finally, since we were in a bit of a time crunch, we asked for the check and tried to get out of there quickly. The service was okay... I could tell they were trying to be very personable and attentive, but maybe it was just too busy? For such a trendy place, though, I would think that it&#39;s this busy on a regular basis.Overall, I had a great dining experience. I don&#39;t know if I would come here again just because I wasn&#39;t blown away... It was definitely unique and I love going to a classy/trendy place every now and then, but there&#39;s so many other choices in the area, I think I would have to try one of those first before coming back to Dosa.NOTE: The other entrees were in the $20+ range, while the Dosas were about $11-12 and each serving was plenty to fill me up (I didn&#39;t finish my plate). If you want something atypical of other Indian restaurants, and want to save some cash, order a Dosa!

The food gets a solid 4-stars. The service gets a solid 2-stars.As with most places in SF, it&#39;s always going to be the service that sets you apart, regardless how good your food may be. The service when I went here killed the experience.We got there and there are tons of empty tables, but since we didn&#39;t have a reservation we ended up at the bar. Usually that&#39;s awesome, you get some attention being right there. You never have to wait for a drink, you can order whatever you want quickly - but not at Dosa.We sat at the bar and waited. And waited. And waited. Finally a we asked the bar back to help us to order, so he told the bar tender who was standing right there that we wanted to order.We asked for his recommendation on some glasses of wine. He couldn&#39;t give us any, so we ordered a few different glasses. One was good, the other was bad. Like bitter gone bad, bad. So I ordered a dirty martini, which the guy had to ask me how to make. *sigh*After waiting a loooooong time, we finally were able to order some food. Now the food came out extremely quick, even though they forgot one of the 4 dishes we had coming (which the kitchen also fixed ASAP). That part of the service made my very happy. They kitchen staff was on it. Too bad the people at the bar were not. I really felt like the bar staff were blessing us with their service, rather then them wanting to make the paying customer happy.Well back to the food. The currys we had were pretty good for being a little less traditional then the Indian food we&#39;re all accustomed to. The Samosas were a bit chewy, and I was shocked they didn&#39;t have any naan, only some kind of fried bread (umm, where in India is deep dried bread from again?). The things they call DOSA&#39;s, aren&#39;t Indian food at all, but from Eastern Africa (go try Ethiopian or Somalian food). But they were still pretty good. Other then the fact the food they serve here should be called &#34;Indian Fusion&#34;, not Indian IMHO, it was overall pretty good. Not greasy, pretty flavorful, and fresh.The atmosphere for the place doesn&#39;t really fit the food either. The look and feel of the place is more modern, like you would see at a fancier place. It didn&#39;t really fit the Indian Fusion vibe.I guess if you can get over the service and want to try a different spin on Indian food, I&#39;d say give this place a try. If you&#39;re in the mood for more traditional Indian, I&#39;d say stay away.

Went to Dosa last night just before trying to head to a show at the Fillmore as it&#39;s just down the street. The show was sold out and sort of a bust, but the food at Dosa certainly wasn&#39;t!We got there at around 6 or just after and it was packed already (it was a Saturday, just after Thanksgiving, so could explain it). The wait for a table was 90mins, but the hostess put our names down for the communal table and said she thought it wouldn&#39;t be long for a spot for 2 to turn up.We got a couple of drinks at the bar, I had their house Gin and Tonic, which is made with a homemade tonic water, it was pretty good, and my friend had their bourbon/chili cocktail which was actually excellent.Took about 20 mins for a spot to turn up on the table and we weren&#39;t disappointed. We ordered a couple of spicy Dosas and the seasonal vegetable curry - all were amazing. My friend said she knew I was enjoying them as I stopped talking and basically inhaled dinner! True.Bar and wait staff were really friendly and chatty, and the food was really tasty and pretty reasonable. I think with drinks and quite a lot of food we were at 30-35 a head.Will be heading there again!

This is the place to come if you want to take your non-indian (or your indian friends from out of town) friends for a taste of india in San Francisco.Great ambiance and really great service. The food is decent - there is nothing to complain about but its not the authentic, yummylicious food you get in the south bay (or India or your mom&#39;s kitchen).I take almost every visitor to this place and everyone loves it (the experience everything). The only people who complain (!) are people who are pickier about their south indian eats (like sambar and the dosa). My mom and dad for example thought the place was just OK. I mean my mom makes better dosas and sambar than this place, so why pay a premium to eat that, right?On the other hand, i dont! so i love it enough to go here, but we mostly visit this place when we have out-of-town guests.My favs - dahi vada, the masala chai, uttapam. I am not one for egg and dosas but my friends have loved the combo. The husband and others like the chicken chettinad and the frankies. I love vada pav, but the one here was too sweet for my liking.They have good cocktails too (that are different from what you may have had previously).

They held our reservation for a few minutes even with a packed house. Nice! Light level and music: lounge-ish, but not too dark or loud to obstruct conversation or make me feel like I was on a date with my bf&#39;s uncles.We came with recs from some Dosa vets and the waiter&#39;s favorites validated the first few things we were going to order anyway. perfect mind meld! it must be true.chennai chicken app was kind of like spiced chicken fingers with yogurt sauce. i mean super yummy chicken fingers, of course.we had a couple of dosas. One of the simple ones with potato. yummy sauces. too bad it was in a triangle. I like when they are giant and rolled.prawn masala and lamb kofta were yummy. I pretty much just wanted the sauces on the rice, which was yummy on its own. I was happy to leave the prawns for others, but when I got one, it was great!dahi vadi was like a spider web of yogurt and chutney with a surprise of lentil cakes or something at the bottom. on the blander side, but my eyes were satisfied, so good show.we paired all this with a couple of bottles of dry riesling (yes, a riesling!). it really cut the heaviness and spice. good choice!we had desserts (coconut cake and passion fruit custard) which were ok. the little coconut cookie and shortbread triangle that came with were the best part of that. and the paired port. lip smackingly sweet! (we probably should have foraged across the street for a japanese sweet.)great service and atmosphere too. lovely art and our expresser was overjoyed to be bringing us our food.

Skip their $39 four-course tasting menu and order a la carte instead. You get a much better selection of dishes and you&#39;ll end up spending a lot less.I&#39;ve been here a 4-5 times already and I also recommend skipping all of their &#34;meat&#34; dishes. None of them were very memorable (except I remember that they were over cooked and very dry) and you can get much better dishes at other Indian restaurants throughout the city.However, their Paper Dosa and their Tamil Vegetable Curry are FANTASTIC. These two menu items will always be included in my order whenever I go here....and probably the main reason why I keep coming back.Negative points for charging a 4% health care charge and then trying to write a letter/note to justify this on your website. Include this in your menu/food prices instead and I&#39;ll respect you more. This just means that you never provided health care to all your staff workers prior to this SF law....they&#39;ll also automatically charge a 20% gratuity on parties of 5 or more. But so far my experience with their staff has been pretty good so that sounds about right. I just hate that its automatic.

I am from Mumbai, Wife is from Bangalore and friends from Gujarat and Channai! We six visited Dosa last weekend.The place was packed on Sunday night at 7 Pm food, thanks to Opentable we got the perfect seating in the corner-booth.Well Service, ambiance, pace with we were served, all 5 starts by default. Every individual who serviced our table knew what the menu is all about, even when it comes to the french pressed Moksha coffee to end the evening in style.As a Mumbaite, I always miss our staple snack, Vada Pav. I must mentioned, in all the restaurants (mostly hyped once) I tried in the bay area, Vada Pav sliders at the DOSA is executed almost to perfection by the Chef. Not exactly Bombay style but the recipe has its own merits. Superb start to the dinner! We ordered various &#34; Virgin drinks, although Dosa has really good collection of sprits &amp; Bar. My fav. drink was Southern Monsoon. It is worth trying for sure.Now to the main course, we ordered variety of Dosas, Spicy Basic, Chile-Garlic, Moong dosa and so on. Different taste, very good presentation. Actually some of us felt that we are eating in some eatery in south India :) Sambar was chennai style, again fantastic! Uttapam moon Platter is amazing :)All in all it was wonderful evening spent with friends and some authentic, spicy indian food and some good fusion music tracks to increase the tempo for the evening!MUST VISIT!!!

Delicious Indian food and great people watching. I was pleasantly surprised that even though the restaurant is always full, it&#39;s not stuffy.

Too noisy, although not nearly as noisy as some other places.The staff is attentive and efficient. All in all, this place is popular for a reason.

After several failed attempts at trying to come here for Dine About Town, I ended up eating off their regular menu which had something similar to DAT but was 4 courses and cost only slightly more. I&#39;m not crazy about Indian food but everything was pretty tasty. I had the calamari, spring dosa, chicken curry and some strange soapy tasting drink for dessert. It was my first time trying dosa and I am now a fan! Chicken curry was also yummy. I didn&#39;t like the calamari though because I was expecting fried calamari and it turned out to be calamari in its original squid form. Though that was really my fault for not understanding that &#34;Grilled Calamari&#34; does not equal &#34;Fried Calamari&#34;. The dessert drink was also pretty awful but I blame the waitress because she recommended it. When in doubt always go for the gelato, can&#39;t go wrong there.

Eh. That was my impression after leaving Dosa. I love (and I mean LOVE) Indian food - add to that a cool, modern environment and you have a great thing. However, the food was just ok - nothing truly memorable. I&#39;ve had better (actually much better) and even ordering something &#34;medium&#34; hot was almost too hot for me. I was there with three others and we all kind of felt the same about this place. I would try it again, but maybe order something different?????

Full bar in an Indian place is an unusual plus.One star off because seriously: Indian cuisine is meant to be for caste system folks, not San Franciscans who like to over-spend like us.That being said, everything is delicious and I love the atmosphere.

It was ok.The decor is hip, the space has open feel and the music jazzy.Service was basic. They made sure to not make eye-contact while speaking to us. Just to let us know, they were so on top of this, they didn&#39;t have to look at us. The one thing remarkable of our attendant was his earring :)The drinks menu is good though. the bar is cool too.

Great food, great service, great drinks... this place can do no wrong! We had been talking about hitting up Dosa on Fillmore a number of times and finally snagged reservations this past weekend. We grabbed a drink at the bar while we were waiting and we were off to a good start: the Bengali gimlet is AMAZING. Their drinks are creative and delish -- we tried a few and they were all exceptional. The ambiance is also pretty awesome -- somewhat ornate; perfect for a date night or for bringing out-of-town guests. When the food came -- wow, wow, yum. We started with an app (vegetarian sliders are phenomenal) and then split an entree and a dosa. The prawn masala stood out to me as being exceptional, but everything was great. The food is spicy so be ready for some heat!

Great, classy indian restaurant in SFO! We stopped by for dinner and discovered they have a happy hour from 4 to 7 pm. Vada pav was yummy! The chili garlic masala dosa was huge! The masala filling was good for two people. Hot sambhar and chutneys spiced it up.I heard their dahi vada is excellent too. A tad pricey, but what else can you expect from a classy restaurant in the city? Awesome service. They serve complimentary papad as well.I left my cap behind, and the kind waiter had handed it over to the front desk, where it was waiting for me when i went back for it. If you crave a dosa, you know where to go!They are open only for dinner on week days.

I was about 20 minutes late for my reservation, but I was still seated in about 10 minutes.The ambiance here is great. I LOVE the gorgeous chandeliers.I went safe and ordered the Masala Dosa, and it was delicious! I loved the chutneys that were served with the Dosa. The coconut chutney and tomato chutney were a good balance. YUMMMY!I also tried the spicy cranberry chile chicken with coconut rice, and it was heavenly!One of my new FAVORITE restaurants!

Went to Dosa after two years yesterday. The service was very poor. We had a 30 minute wait between our appetizers and the main course. The server offered no explanation even though we asked her a couple times about the food. She should have comped one of the entrees. I&#39;m sad to say I&#39;m not going back . I&#39;d rather spend $100 some where else.

Took here 2 guests from out of town, this one of my favorite places to take out of town guests, it&#39;s not too fancy, not too expensive, interesting take on indian food and the atmosphere is really good.As usual the food was great, service was good and we all had a great experience.The only issue was that it&#39;s very dark on the 2nd floor and we had some problem reading the menu (especially the older)

A cozy yet casual, intimate yet fun place and experience. I came with two girl friends on a Monday night around 7 and were seated immediately by the window. We stuffed ourselves and I am now a fan of Dosa and am so so glad that the 7x7 list brought me here!Good things (so pretty much everything we ordered)Appetizer:- Vada pav (veggie slider): Okay so the name really doesn&#39;t do it justice, mostly because I love meat and think all sliders should be made with beef patties, but this was SO flavorful and delicious. The bun is sweet and the caramelized onions provide a nice contrast to the dry but perfectly seasoned potatoes. The dish comes with gunpowder, which is this spicy chili powder that you mix with melted butter to form a chili spread. It&#39;s really fun to make haha. BTW this is also super spicy.Main courses:- Channa bhatura: Probably my favorite indian dish ever. This gigantic fried, puffy dough comes out and hot steam actually comes out when you tear into it. It&#39;s such a wonderful sight! Then you dip the bread into this wonderfully flavorful chickpea dish and you can expect what my roommate calls a &#34;food baby&#34; for the rest of the evening. So worth it. I&#39;ve had this dish at Vik&#39;s Chaat in Berkeley, but the puffy thing is overly greasy there. It&#39;s actually quite light and flavorful here.- Paper masala dosa: This is what I came to try, the infamous paper masala dosa. It&#39;s actually humungous so, if you can visualize, three girls at the smallest table possible with the giant bhatura and now this long dosa too. I think we were in a little over our heads when we ordered :) So our waiter advised us on how to eat this, by tearing off a piece of the crispy dosa and dipping it into the potato mixture and then dipping it into one of three sauces: sambar, a tomato sauce and a coconut sauce. We ended up mixing and matching everything on our table, which was an extremely pleasant experience for our tastebuds haha. The only complaint about this dish is that the dosa itself is a little salty, so dipping it is kind of necessary to offset the saltiness.Dessert:- Rasmalai: I don&#39;t know how we managed to do this because we basically had carbs for our entire meal, but we ended up picking this. It&#39;s a surprisingly light dessert even though it&#39;s creamy and has the texture of panna cotta but is made of CHEESE! The rosewater fragrance is really nice and the pistachios add a great texture. Perfect way to end such a heavy meal.The total came out to be $60 after tax and tip. The best part was probably our waiter who explained how to eat everything haha. Definitely coming back to try all the other different dosas...and to have something with meat.

i&#39;ve never had dosa before, here or anywhere else. dosa, where have you been all my life???this particular dosa was delicious, safely gluten free (very little risk of contamination), vegan, filling portions... this was just an awesome dinner.the wait staff was really friendly and understanding about all my millions of questions about the food just to make sure it was truly glutenfree.whatever you order, make sure you get tamarind chutney on the side, because it was delicious.

After receiving a note from one of the owners, I&#39;ll change my review to say that you&#39;re not paying for just the ambiance you&#39;re also paying for:- We&#39;re the only Indian restaurant that uses primarily organic and sustainable ingredients which are more expensive.- We also use freshly ground spices that are shipped from India and are quite expensive- We provide everyone with a decent living wage for standard of living in San Francisco!- We provide health care to all our employeesSo now you know.

Wow. Now I&#39;m no Indian food connoisseur but I do love to experience cuisine from all over the world. Dosa surprised me on so many levels, I don&#39;t even know where to begin. Similar to the way I felt when first looking at the menu, the size of a novel. Our waiter recommended what we needed to try as first timers and what could wait until our next time around. Her selections could not have been more spot on. Started with the grilled calamari, followed by the dahi vada, spicy basil dosa and ending with the mango prawns. Our meal was such a perfect combination of Indian flavors, cool and spicy, I don&#39;t know how I could order anything different next time. Can&#39;t wait to go back.

I&#39;ll start with the caveat that I&#39;m no big fan of Indian food. Don&#39;t dismiss me right away; I&#39;m pretty much a fan of any cuisine in the book, but I just can&#39;t get myself to love Indian. With that said, I was pleasantly surprised with the quality and price at Dosa.Let&#39;s start with the fact that reservations mean practically nothing at this place, which you kind of expect since it&#39;s ridiculously trendy. But c&#39;mon, we had a table for 8 well in advance, and it takes you 30+ minutes to seat us? This wouldn&#39;t be so bad if there were ample waiting area at the bar, but walk-ins+reservation waiters jam overstuff this area. It didn&#39;t help that my vodka on the rocks cost $12-ish for what seemed like less than a shot. Dosa&#39;s got a nice mixed drinks menu, but I&#39;ll pass, thanks.However, once we sat, everything was gravy. We had post-dinner reservations elsewhere, and conveyed that message to our waitress, who was happy to oblige. Service was prompt, and the view from the second floor was incredible. Their dosas aren&#39;t too expensive given the large portion size; I went with the rava masala. The same can&#39;t be said for their appetizers, which are really a two person max and were decent at best. The other main courses around there table were delicious as well; I particularly favored the lamb curry.All in all, I&#39;m docking a star for the start of the meal (pricey drinks and a prolonged wait), but strongly recommend this place if you&#39;re looking for trendy, delicious Indian food.

Delicioso. Wait a second, that&#39;s kind of Spanish. This place is Indian, make no mistake. And it&#39;s well worth a visit.Cool atmosphere and good service. Looks like they had a full bar, too, but I just drank water and tea.My buddy took me here for dinner after an afternoon of street photography and we were tired (good tired) and hungry. My friend was treating, confirmed if I&#39;d be down for anything, and asked the waiter to &#34;surprise us&#34; (in a good way, of course).We were surprised, in a great way, and had some lamb chops that were divine. Never had that at an Indian food restaurant, but they were the bomb.Everything was good. Sorry, I don&#39;t remember the names of everything. But we ended up with surf, turf, and veggies. Washed it down with a couple of mugs of hot chai tea and I was a happy camper.

Absolutely loved this place!I recommend making reservations for this place. 3 Hours into the evening and there was still a 1 hour wait for a table. We ate at the bar which got really packed around 8pm onwards.I&#39;m surprised at what a good job they did with a south indian menu. The food tasted authentic for the place being so contemporary. Very delicious Dosas. I first ordered the Roasted garlic and chile dosa which i found to be extremely HOT! My mouth and tongue were on fire, so then i ordered the mysore masala dosa and it was very good. The Roasted Garlic and Chile is a good choice if you can handle the spice.Drinks are pricey but good selection of drinks. The bartenders were very helpful in helping us select good shots. We had a shot called the batsman. I TOTALLY recommend it if you want to do shots. I&#39;ve never had something like this before. It&#39;s gin, vodka and ginger beer. It goes down smooth. I also had the lime soda which is on the non-alcoholic but asked for it to be a vodka lime soda and it tasted very refreshing.Good Service!Look forward to going back again.

WOW. I. love. this. place.We came here for our Valentine&#39;s dinner. We got a very decently priced four-course dinner, tons of leftovers, and lots of time to bask in the restaurant&#39;s very chic ambiance (and kind of weird modern pop music). Our food:- Lotus stem day boat scallops. Perfect.- Masala dosa. Classic but sooo good, guys. My boyfriend basically drank his sambar, and then mine too.- Trumpet mushroom uttapam. That note of truffle was perfect. It&#39;s a good dish, but I&#39;d want to try something new next time.- Lamb vindaloo and chicken biryani: The meat in both these dishes was crazy flavorful and tender. Boyfriend did note that the lamb was a tad salty.- Pistachio d&#39;acquoise. Earthy and decadent, but no contest for the...- Red velvetine truffle. MY GOD. This is probably a special occasion dessert, so I&#39;m hesitant to let you know what you may be missing. Well -- there was white chocolate mousse, red velvet, chocolate flakes, and a perfect strawberry involved. The boyfriend isn&#39;t even really a sweets person and he was flipping out about its deliciousness.5 stars for food. -1 star, unfortunately, for the service. Granted, it was a busy night, but we waited a very long time between courses, which wasn&#39;t the case for the people around us (shout out to our runner, the only person who apologized for the delay). Still... we are more than willing to come back on a slower night and let Dosa redeem itself!

Service was excellent, as well as the food. Everyone has gushed about both as well. I liked my mango lassi (thick, creamy, and leading me to believe all other mango lassis are needlessly diluted with water), and the cool lighting fixtures in the restaurant.The only new thing I have to add is that the hand dryers in the women&#39;s room (XLerator) should be replaced by Dyson air blades. That is all.

I was looking forward to an amazing dining experience so i was pretty underwhelmed. The food was just OK. Everything was good, nothing stood out as great, which is what I expected considering the price. We had the chennai chicken, lamb kofta, prawns massala and one of the dosas. I can&#39;t say it lived up to the rave reviews. By the end of the night my group was wondering if the $10 indian buffet next door would have been the better choice...Aside from the food, the decor is chic and trendy. The drinks are strong. It&#39;s a great spot if you are looking for a fun, sexy bar atmosphere. If you want quality food, I&#39;d skip it. You can get better Indian food for a fraction of the price at your local hole in the wall.

A girlfriend and I had a friend in town, and she recommended we check out Dosa. We arrived to find out that we had about a 40 minute wait-- no problem, though, because we could have a drink at the bar. They each got a mango lassi (which I tried-- so refreshing and flavorful!), and I ordered my favorite Indian beer, Flying Horse. We took in the scene: huge, bright windows and trendy, new decor. Very chic.25 minutes later, the nice hostess stopped by and asked if we&#39;d be willing to sit at the shared table, which was a long, tall table next to the bar. It meant we wouldn&#39;t have to wait any longer. Sure! We were seating alongside two other dining parties, but not crammed in at all.The waitress was helpful, suggested a few items off the menu, and promptly took our order. My friends got the Spring Dosa, and I tried the Spicy Mung Masala. I love spice in general and I loved this Spicy Mung Masala! (On a second trip to Dosa, I got the South Indian Moons, which was a chef&#39;s selection of five different Uttapams-- I recommend that if you like to sample. A little pricier at $13.50, but worth it for the variety.)For the elegance of the restaurant and the fun of the food&#39;s presentation, I was surprised by how affordable Dosa is, at around $10 per plate. Ingredients seemed very fresh, and each dosa is served with several chutneys to flavor your dosa choice and cool off your mouth (if you happen to find something too spicy).I returned here with my boyfriend for a date night, before heading over to the Kabuki theater for a movie afterwards. Great place to relax, with plenty of seating (they have an upstairs, too). During the week we had no wait. Be sure to ask lots of questions if you don&#39;t know what to order, the waitstaff in general is very well-informed.I only wish I lived walking distance from Dosa. Can&#39;t wait to go back!

I find the original Dosa a bit more personable. I think because of the guy with the spikey hair who remembers everyone even if they haven&#39;t been in, in a while. But the atmosphere of the Fillmore Dosa is certainly more fab. High ceilings, big community table...a hip color pallete. It was great for a group dinner.I came here for a dinner with the girls, and while the food was good, and service attentive I wasn&#39;t blown away. Certainly good quality food and a positive dining experience, but most of my girlfriends agreed they weren&#39;t feeling it much.Think I&#39;ll stick to the mission location for brunches, which never disappoint.

We asked for him to come back for us to review the menu a little longer and he came back like 10 minutes later. It&#39;s also very dimly lit so you will literally need your iphone to read it.

What a great dinner! Reservations were made without any problems. Karla K. and I arrived for dinner around 6:40 (yes, I felt like a senior citizen) because we were headed to a show at The Fillmore. I can just say that service is impeccable and completely professional. Food presentation is divine; I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s the lighting, the decor, or a combination of all put together.Four-course tasting menu:Prawn Chile Fry -- incredibly spiced, but not at all spicy. Splash some lemon on them and they come alive as if they were still swimming in the great big Ocean (or wherever they came from).Cilantro-Mint Masala -- This is one of those dishes you wish were bigger and easy so you could make it every day at home. The 3 dipping sauces (or chutneys) were perfectly paired with the herby flavors of the masala. The coconut ended up being my favorite, sambar (lentil + vegetables) second, and tomato chutney third.Chicken and Eggplant with a side of lemon rice -- There&#39;s nothing bad I can say about the chicken and eggplant. I only had 1 slice of eggplant so it would have been nice to have more. The lemon rice on the other hand ... I&#39;D KILL FOR THAT RECIPE. The most flavorful rice I&#39;ve ever had. Ever.For Dessert: Gulab Jamoon. I&#39;m sorry Gulab, but you disappointed me. I took a risk ordering something I wasn&#39;t familiar with, and failed. It was too mushy, which is a shame because the flavors were pretty good. Sweet and warm syrup with chopped nuts cannot compensate for a mushy Gulab (think: doughnut hole).

I&#39;ve been here for dinner and for weekend brunch. The food is excellent and the interior is beautiful.The vibe is livelier for dinner than for brunch. If you&#39;re looking for a quiet brunch, this is a good spot for you. I&#39;m a fan of eggs for brunch, and this is not your typical eggs and bacon place! Their brunch dishes seemed a nice creative fusion.As a dinner spot, I love the vibe and the food.If you are in the mood for Indian food -- definitely go!

This is a solid 4 star for Dosa, leaning toward the non-existent 4.5 mark. I decided to come here for my birthday dinner since I had this on my go-to list for quite some time. Within the past year I have been turned on to South Indian cuisine and make somewhat-freqent trips to Vik&#39;s in Berkeley for lunch, so I am quite familiar with what is widely considered to be &#34;good&#34; South Indian food.Knowing that reservations are not always a given at this location, I was pleasantly surprised to hear that they would be able to accommodate my group of 12 on a Saturday night given just one week advanced notice.I started with a fantastic cocktail: The Bollywood Hills - and tried a few sips of other interesting drinks - all of which were unique and tasty. It would be worth it to come here just for cocktails if you are only up for a drink and want to take in the vibrant atmosphere.It is the atmosphere that sets Dosa apart from any other South Indian restaurant that I have been to in the past. Unlike other establishments of similar cuisine, the decor and vibe of the restaurant is one that would be suitable for bringing out of towners or clients, or great for a girls night out.The most important aspect of a restaurant is obviously the food - and Dosa does not disappoint. I tried my Vik&#39;s staples, the Dahi Vada and a Dosa (I selected a spring dosa) and was please with both the presentation and taste. The Dahi Vada - &#34;Lentil dumplings topped with cool Straus organic yogurt, piped with tamarind &amp; mint, mildly spiced&#34; was beautiful. I don&#39;t think it quite lived up to Vik&#39;s version of the dish (not as spicy) but it was still enjoyable and worth ordering again. The Spring Dosa (think large filled crepe) - &#34;Masala dosa combined with fresh vegetables including peas, carrots, cabbage &amp; red onion&#34; was different than the normal potato filled version and I felt that it was prepared tastefully - not leaving me feeling heavy or unhealthy.Service was attentive and everyone else at the table seemed to enjoy their meal. You don&#39;t have to be a hard core ethnic cuisine lover to enjoy this restaurant. There&#39;s something on the menu for everyone and I look forward to going back and trying something new!(note: I did go back just two weeks after my first visit and ordered the Spring Dosa again...but I really will try something new some time...my Vegan friend - plentyof vegan options available - said she couldn&#39;t stop thinking about her meal...)

Overall as a restaurant I will give it 4 stars.For the food I&#39;d give it a 3-3.5.The restaurant itself is beautiful and the service was great. There was also a very unique drink menu which was a plus.In terms of Indian food, I don&#39;t know what it is, but nothing really amazes me. Everything really tastes the same to me. The Dosas were all pretty good and the chicken curry was good, but it was nothing really mind blowing.I would definitely come back if I was invited and try some more things, but as indian food goes, I&#39;m still not convinced.

This place seemed overly decorated at first and I was hestiant that the food didn&#39;t match the showpiece chandeliers and high cielings. The scene definitely had a Vegas-y feel to it and it was a little dim...Even with my high expectations, I was pleasantly delighted with the extremely flavorful food. It&#39;s definitely helpful to know what to order or you feel like your taking a South Indian cultures class.Nonetheless, these were perfect choices:1. Chennai Chicken - Tender and moist, Indian style chicken wings with a cool lemony sour creamish dip to balance the spice.2. Bhel Puri - Refeshing mango crispy salad that was fresh and impactful.3. Duck Spinach Masala &amp; Paneer w/ tomato rice - Even more tender duck with a dense/creamy spinachy curry with blocks of cheese. Intensely flavored, great in small bites and a must with the tomato rice.All in all, a unique harmony of spices located right across from the Kabuki and a nice break from sushi.

Dear Mr. Prawn &#34;Frankie,&#34;You completely rocked my world yesterday at lunch. Forget DAT, I just needed you and all your deliciousness for $13.I would best describe you as a skinny, long, Indian burrito. You ooze with delicious curry-ness with your potatoes, prawns, onions, and whatever else is going on inside that fluffy, yummy, dosa-like outside.You are so filling...that you forced me into a 2 hour nap post devourment.Yum.

What a wonderful experience. There&#39;s even a wonderful selection of gluten-free, dairy-free and nut-free options. The food is delicious. The sauces are wonderfully nuanced and the dishes are balanced and inventive. The staff is friendly and service is attentive. A new home away from home!!!

So originally I was gonna go to the one on Valenica, but I heard this location is a bit more mellow. And I was exhausted but still had to go out. Ambiance is great, decor is simply gorgeous. Food amazing esp since I haven&#39;t had Indian food in quite some time. Staff, attentive.Samosas- I like the North India ones better than the SouthScallops- Perfectly cooked!Bhatura- puffy and goldenBrazino- I love Brazino, hate the bones---PEONY drink. Fabulous!!!!Waitress informed us it was last call for food and drinks. Asked if we needed anything else, we said no, but thought dessert menu was on way...NOPE. A little bummed since I love my desserts.

This is one of the best south indian places that I have eaten at...We had the dosa, the uttapam and the chennai chicken. The dosa and uttapam were really good..but the chennai chicken was absolutely world class. The service was also really good. Definitely will be going here again, the next time I am in SF.

What is this giant restaurant doing on lower Fillmore...The first time I went here I wondered this and by the third time I&#39;d been here it started to feel slightly more cozy (maybe the cramped seating?). Yes the interior does feel like it&#39;s in the wrong city or at least neighborhood but the food and beverages are fantastic.I&#39;ve been persuaded to try a Riesling here that was actually well balanced, delicious and not akin to drinking sugar water. The sampler Uttapam plate is delicious lots of great flavors and three different condiments are always a plus. The Dosa&#39;s of course are delicious and great for sharing. I&#39;ve been here numerous times and always had a delicious meal. The service is consistent as well and the price point is reasonable for the area.

This review will seem like a slam, but I do like this place.Food is spicy but pricey.Ambiance: Yes, it&#39;s Indian, but I felt a WASP undertone. I noticed the accents around the front door were not really Indian. The chandeliers must have cost a fortune--they definitely make the room opulent. I love the picture of the Indian woman in a sea of flowers. Love the high ceilings, but I think they could done more to the ceiling than just white tile. Perhaps some brushed metal henna pattern or something!Bar area was well planned. Good traffic flow, and airy. Definitely come for drinks--Bengali Gimlet, wow.I had a hodgepodge of dishes, so I don&#39;t know exactly what I had. All I know is that the spices were very crisp, clean, and full of flavor. I did not expect the dishes to have so much kick--a pleasant surprise.I had the rasmalai for dessert. The rose water was subtle and not too overpowering. Oh BTW, the waiter did not pronounce rasmalai correctly.

My best friend took me here and I&#39;m so glad she did.Their entire menu looks delicious, everything we had tasted great.For me the best part were the cocktails. Being a flower lover I ordered the Peony. This is now my new favorite drink, I&#39;ve already hunted down the recipe. The color is a perfect peony pink. It&#39;s a little creamy from the sweetened coconut milk, and it has the perfect touch of spice and lime.Oh yeah - the service was great, and the ambiance is delightful. Good lighting.

1. Beautiful restaurant2. Amazingly delicious food3. Outstanding service4. Very well pricedI can&#39;t say enough good things about dosa. The food is wonderful. I make my own dosas - I know! But even better is that I brought my almost 2 yr old daughter and the staff was so friendly and anticipated things before I requested them. Magically a booster chair showed up in a second, then the waiter brought a plastic cup with cover and a straw. Every staff member passed by with a smile. I like that!

Dosa was like the man who was too good to be true.Comfortable in his skin, without a thing to prove, Dosa delivered amazing ginger cocktails, spinach fennel dosas, garbanzo salad, and some sexy rasmalai.While I believe that &#34;authentic&#34; cuisine is just as limiting as essentializing race, I also am not down for &#34;fusion&#34; cuisine that involves sticking a sprig of cilantro on some bland ass food and calling it ethnic. Dosa confidently takes desi food and sometimes adds its own twist but knows when to leave things perfect the way they are.Creative, spicy, and swank, Dosa has me crushing.

I rarely give five stars and DOSA deserves all five stars.when I first walked in, I automatically knew that this was going to be a good night. HAHA.The waiters and waitresses were attentive to our needs and also gave us newbies suggestions on what to order.I started off with the Potato Leek and Rice soup. I was quite surprised when it came in a greenish color, but nonetheless, that didn&#39;t stop me from eating it. I&#39;m a big fan of potato leek soups and I gotta say---it was on point. The rice added a great texture to it as well. Perfect blend of rice and soup, without each other overpowering one another.Our table also shared a few appetizers. We ordered the Dahi Vada, which is Lentil dumplings topped with cool Straus organic yogurt, piped with tamarind &amp; mint, mildly spiced.The dumplings were like a hard doughnut, yet it matched perfectly with the cold yogurt. It was also blended with some spices. Put them together in one bite and it&#39;s perfection.We got another appetizer but I forget the name! But it was good...ahhaa.As for entrees, we each got different entrees and just shared it.1. Channa Bhatura Chickpea (garbanzo) masala served with an oversized, soft, puffy wheat bread or vegan poori.- Oversized doesn&#39;t cut it, it was HUGE, it was like a huge balloon, then they popped it and deflated it. You tore into it and dipped it into the garbanzo masala. Delicious.2. Chicken &amp; Eggplant &#39;Baingan Bharta&#39; Organic boneless, Fulton Valley, roasted &amp; pureed eggplant, peas (great w/ lemon rice)- This was one of our favorite dishes. The lemon rice definitely hit the spot.We got two types of different dosas, all of which were great!The soundtrack that they were playign throughout dinner was amazing as well that my friend and I had to ask the waiter to ask for the song titles.Overall, great experience, great food, every dish had a different taste to it and its the diversity of that really stood out.

im a big fan of Dosa on Fillmore, much more so that on Valencia...the venue is cleaner...youre not packed in tight like a can of sardines...oh, and theres enough light so you can actually see your food...like just about every time i go out for drinks at a restaurant...i end up eating...ALOT at that...grabbed a glass of jameson and soda and took a look at the menu...id been to the Dosa on Valencia a few years back and all i remember was that i wasnt too fond of it although i love indian food in general...we ended up ordering a handful of things...couple curries, couple dosa crepes, some calamari, a chicken dish and a tomato and onion Uttapam...the Dosa Crepe&#39;s are what Dosa is known for...large (XL) crepes come served up to your table...rip into it, dip it in curry, wrap up whatever meats they bring out to you...a very simple and easy food to enjoy...indian food to me has always been about big, bold, and spicy...the cooks at Dosa keep their food on par with those flavors...staff is very friendly and accommodating...all around service is pretty good...if youre sitting at a table and dont mind walking to the bar to grab a drink, id definitely recommend to do so...several times we ordered drinks from our server and it took a lot longer than it should have...luckily, i was too busy gorging on curry to let it bother me...great experience...will definitely be back for a curry and crepe fix sooner than later!

I finally got my butt to DOSA on Fillmore - Dine About Town&#39;s lunch deal made an easy must try..... 2 courses for $17.95.The was as good as expected - unique, full of flavor and I loved it.The ambiance is great too - what a nice place, I kept imagining having a private party in that cool upstairs area. Or sitting at the full bar and sharing something with a friend.The chickpea/avocado salad with spicy citrus dressing was good - with a real kickThe fried chicken app - with yogurt sauce and unique slaw was great.The Paneer DOSA - goodThe lamb meatballs with saffron rice - great.My BF and I loved everything. My tummy did not and doesn&#39;t want me to go back there - my mouth however, is arguing that very hard....

Ever go to dinner with a bunch of people and everyone is wondering whether or not to share and then you decide that you are going to all share a bunch of starters and then get your own entrees and share bites of those with each other, only you get your entree and it&#39;s so damn good that you don&#39;t want anyone else having it and you really don&#39;t care about tasting anyone else&#39;s because you know you already ordered the best and you shouldn&#39;t have to share anyway since it&#39;s your birthday and you&#39;re also kind of a selfish bitch anyway?Yeah, me neither.The cocktails here are delicious. I really like the Peony. And the Smoked Cup. So creative, so refreshing.We shared a bunch of starters. The mung sprout salad was good - and had quite a kick. We also had some spicy chicken appetizer which was really good. But the star of the course was the spicy sweet scallops.But my entree was outstanding. Lamb Kofta. Little lamb meatballs in a spicy cream sauce. The perfect amount of kick. And the lemon rice they recommend compliments it wonderfully. I got a side of uttapam to go with it and wrapped that around small bites of lamb balls and rice. Mmmm. Delicious. When I finally came up for air and realized I couldn&#39;t finish the whole thing, I offered small bites to the rest of the table. SMALL bites.So go with a bunch of friends. And share a bunch of appetizers. But keep those bitches away from your lamb kofta.

Beautiful environment, pretty exquisite and unique Indian food. The halibut was amazing. The breads are wow. LOVED the mango goat cheese hazelnut salad. The dosas are crazy big and so good.The service was kind of spotty and weird. Got a drink order at the bar and then was brought to table - the drink was TOTALLY forgotten. (dropped ball) Then our servers were switched mid-meal, which was weird. It felt like nobody really was in charge of us or cared. But it was fine, not disastrous, but hardly attentive.I would totally come back though.

My review is both a praise and apology. Last night a group of us camein to celebrate it being the end of the week (as you should!), and hada great sampling of what Dosa has to offer - dosas, curries, wine, &amp;of course, cocktails! Our server Zach was really knowledgeable aboutwhat dishes went well together, what to start with, and recommended a great bottle of wine(so good, we ordered three!).We were having a good time until one of my friends, in her not-so-glorious drunken stupor, happened to reach across and grab ourserver&#39;s ass as he was helping another table nearby. We allimmediately berated her, mortified that she pulled that off during abusy dinner time. Zach totally took it in stride and continued to showa classy attitude, and even joked with us for the rest of teh evening.So for that, we thank you and are very sorry about our friend&#39;sbehavior. It was out of line, but definitely hilarious. We&#39;ll be backfor more great food, cocktails, &amp; hopefully less ass-grabbing:)5 stars!

While waiting for a table to open up for dinner at another restaurant we spent a very pleasant 90 minutes sitting here at the bar. Dosa is a high end Indian cuisine restaurant but the bartenders are awesome as is the bar menu. They even sampled a few really nice gins so I could decide what to drink. Very high class but not high priced.

Delicious Southern Indian cuisine that probably wont give you a heart attack (immediately). Which is sort of a bummer, since that means less buttery goodness.The mango lassi seems to be fresh! Major bonus, since I can&#39;t help but drink at least 2 of these...

Love, love, love this place! The food, the tasting menu, drinks, ambience, sense of space, customer service (most of the time), acoustics (given the amount of tables in this restaurant, you can still enjoy an intimate dinner with your party), da da da-da da-da.... The only thing I miss is the paneer and peas dosa which was replaced by a paneer and mango dosa -- still delicious but I miss the former. Anyway, they have to keep it fresh so i won&#39;t dock them for that. My go-to Indian restaurant when Im craving a southern indian meal with a bit of swank.

Stopped in at this place as passing by and glad i did. It was busy but we were seated quite quickly with polite, kind service throughout.The food was also very great. I have experienced some better dosa&#39;s in a couple places in vancouver, this was the first time i&#39;ve had a dosa here. They were on the small side compared to traditional dosa&#39;s I&#39;ve had which are far too big for any plate. But these will do a good job of filling you as well.Check it out for some good south indian cuisine and a nice ambiance.

Heard a lot about Dosa, and finally made it there. Wow. Very very nice. Loved everything we had ( I know not what it was...I was fortunate enough to be there with Dosa veterans, so I just got to sit back and eat whatever came across my plate). It was not cheap, but thats totally okay. I&#39;d probably goWTO 4 1/2 or 5 stars but Vic&#39;s in Berkeley is just as good, if not better, for way less money. damn reference points.

I used to go to Dosa on Valencia all the time. I knew there were certain things to get and certain things not to. It had been awhile since I&#39;d been to any Dosa, and I was really excited to finally check out the filmore location.Firstly, it is a beautiful beautiful room, but I feel it&#39;s pretty tough to get a table where you&#39;re not cramped around other people. Fortunately, the service is so efficient that you don&#39;t feel neglected by your server at all, but it is sometimes tempting to listen to other&#39;s conversations -- they&#39;re like two inches from you after all.Back to service. It amazes me how fast our service was, and so attentive. I was impressed. The restaurant was cramped and we never felt forgotten. I asked for quite a bit, and I got everything in an instant without the slightest bit of annoyance. I was impressed.Now to the food. I feel like it is really not there. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s just me or what, but it was like some of the taste was zapped out of the food. I ordered the Dahi Vadi, my usual safe bet, and found it way less flavorful than usual. The balance of yogurt and chutney taste wasn&#39;t there - the yogurt taste won.My friend ordered a coconut fish dish. His was the winner. I ordered spinach and duck curry. It came in a thin sauce that was very spicy but didn&#39;t have that creamy flavor that I usually expect from spinach curries -- usually I order this and many other things at Indian restaurants with the expectation that I&#39;m about to do my body a great disservice. This is something I accept and am even excited about. I felt that the sauce was bland, and asked my friend if I had accidentally ordered the chicken dish instead of the duck because I couldn&#39;t tell the difference. Sad face :(We got a great sounding dessert, a sorbet with cardamum and some other flavors. It was good, but really watery compared to what I was expecting.All and all, i like the idea of these restaurants (both locations), and that it ascribes to be healthy, but I can&#39;t help but realize that I never finish my food when I go there.

I came here for a friend&#39;s birthday earlier this year. While Dosa has a cool ambiance, I wasn&#39;t particularly impressed with either the food or the service. Despite having made a reservation for our group, we were made to wait almost 45 minutes before getting seated. That&#39;s pretty unacceptable for wait time, especially with a reservation. The masala dosa I ordered was not very authentic, and, while it was interesting, I had a hard time getting into the somewhat watered-down cocktail I ordered. I did think the restaurant space itself was great for birthdays or nights out...if only the contents of the package (food + service + reservations system) were up to par with the nice interior.

The ambiance of the place was already worth the price - the staff was extremely friendly and responsive. In addition, the Bollywood music really added a great touch (was definitely jamming to a few). The food was great and tasty (in particular the sambar was just the perfect amount of spicy). I got the masala uttapam which, as mentioned by our server, the spiciest dish on the menu - it certainly lived up to that. The taste was phenomenal and just a great experience all around; I highly recommend this place.

Trivia....What&#39;s plump, doughy, slightly steamy, and full of spice?If you answered me getting out of a hot shower after mexican food night you are wrong.Close.But wrong.The answer is the Masala Uttapam at Dosa.I could eat 12 of those bastards and not even flinch.I have been here a few times and have experienced the same each time.Strong drinks, spicy foods, and a cool atmosphere.Do not miss the crab cakes.Speaking of crab, I would LOVE to see &#34;Deadliest Catch: India&#34; on discovery channel.I am sure the witty banter between the fishermen would be a sight not to be missed.Footballs.

I&#39;ve had a craving for dosas ever since the epic dosa experience of Favorite&#39;s monstrous, table-crushing ~3&#39; crepe of mind-imploding goodness, so the trek to Dosa began.It&#39;s got the feeling of a trendy-indie-night club but feels less awkward in the company, but the same number of beards. Carolynne K. and I were seated next to a fairly talkative group, so prepare for the conversation volume-level wars to ensue immediately on receipt of your menu from the hostess. I liked their selection of mixed adult beverages, but what really grabbed my attention was their &#34;Mint Lemonade&#34; sans the alcohol. For a &#34;dosa place&#34; I felt conflicted as to why their menu was both small and all-encompassing at the same time. Perhaps a &#34;customize your dosa&#34; is in order?We started off with their rendition of what was clearly a Casear Salad that hit us with a disappointment of &#34;garlic&#34; and watery salad. The flavors were an odd accompaniment to any Indian dish. What made my night though was the endless orders of Papadam that we quickly devoured with their (extra) chili/garlic chutney that would probably force me to surgically remove my tongue once I started consuming it tasty spoonful by fiery spoonful.If the chutney wasn&#39;t enough to make the drive from the East Bay worth it, the bowl of Rasam (Fire Broth as they call it) was one of the best tomato based soups I&#39;ve ever had. It was difficult to share in its dominating power of flavor seduction, but I guess we will just have to order 20 bowls next time.I received my dosa soon after finishing said Rasam, and became increasingly confused as to what Dosa (with a capital D for DSupersmalldosas) was giving me. It was filled with a spiced potato mixture that was unnecessarily lumpy for a &#34;rip-it and dip-it&#34; dinner experience, although the flavors of both the batter and the potatoes were supreme. I guess my hopes were set too high, but Dosa delivered on flavor.

Dosa can be summed up in one word: delicious.I met a friend here for a quick bite before a show on a Friday night. We sat near the bar at the community table (which is an awesome idea) and ordered a couple items. The mint dosa started us off on the right track, which we followed with the spicy curry prawns with yogurt rice. They have a great wine list and bar in general.Everything was amazing from the service to the ambiance to the decor. I&#39;m sure I will be back to try many more yummy items from Dosa.

Fancy with some sweet light fixtures.I&#39;ve only been here once and I feel like I might have to go back and try another dish.I had the duck spinach masala and it wasn&#39;t bad but I think I would enjoyed another dish a bit more. The dish I had was a bit rich and lacked something that I can&#39;t really put my finger on. However, my girlfriend had the classic masala dosa and it tasted great!Our server was fantastic and the overall atmosphere was great! I&#39;ll definitely have to go back and try something else.

Yelp, I&#39;m very upset with you for misdirecting me. This place is all flash with no substance. The trumpet mushroom uttapam was tasty. Greasy but tasty. Not exactly fitting for a restaurant of this sort of flash, but delectable nonetheless. The salmon curry dish was where everything went wrong. The dish, described as containing coconut milk (which tends to cool things down), was overpoweringly salty and acidic, as if it was made entirely of tomatoes boiled in vinegar. It was very hard to eat, never mind enjoy. We&#39;re chicken about complaining and simply hate food waste, so we swallowed the thing. Honestly, we just wanted to get out of there and get to our show. Around us, two service mistakes were made at the tables adjacent to us. No one looked happy. As far as the dosa and the uttapam dishes goes, they are good but really not worth the price or the pain of sitting through a restaurant trying to convince you they can churn out 5 star fare.

DOSA is the bomb!When I visit my friends in SF and they ask me where I want to get to dinner, they get the same reply.... DOSA.I don&#39;t get tired of their delicious creative food and could care less about all the new hot spots that try to draw me away from my favorite restaurant in SF

Good cocktails, excellent appetizers. The Chennai chicken and lamb kabab were real tasty. The chicken biryani was up to the mark but would have preferred it without the raisins. The spicy basil dosa was a little soggy when we got it but tasted good. We tried the spicy chile uttapam, the one with 4 different chilies, its not for everyone, stay away from it and enjoy the other relatively milder dishes.Good restaurant in a good neighborhood...would definitely recommend it.

It feels like I&#39;ve been dying to eat here ever since this location opened, and finally, last Friday I had my first delicious experience! My girlfriends and I sat at the bar where a very helpful and knowledgable server/bartender named Kevin helped us make all the right menu choices, even down to the order in which we should eat things.What we ordered: Mungsprout salad, North &amp; South Samosas, scallops, and the paneer and peas dosa to share.First we ate the scallops and the samosas. The scallops were the best I&#39;ve had in San Francisco. They were the perfect size and I loved all the different sauces on the plate to drag my bite of scallop through. Then the samosas - delicious and again with fun dipping sauces.I have to admit I didn&#39;t know what to expect with the mungsprout salad but it was one of the most refreshing and healthy (in a good way) things I&#39;ve every tasted. It complimented the more heavyness of the dosa perfectly (Thanks for the tip Kevin!). It was crunchy and light, perfect. Now for the dosa - I love paneer so this would have been hard to get wrong, and it was oh so right. I enjoyed every bit and was perfectly satisfied with all of my tastings of food.I can&#39;t wait to come back and try more!!

LOVE THIS PLACE.I&#39;ve been to the one on Valencia too, but this one is the nicer, upscale one. The decor is beautiful, classy and trendy.Dosa is what you make of it. I think you can eat there fairly inexpensively, the portions are big, but if you want to order the good stuff, it might cost you a little extra.I&#39;ve had the four course tasting menu here. It&#39;s a little pricey but you get to try a lot. The stand outs were the dosas (obviously) and the sustainable fish. The fish is AMAZING. You can&#39;t get that at the Valencia location either. I probably wouldn&#39;t get the tasting menu again because now I feel confident I know what&#39;s good, and dessert at Dosa doesn&#39;t really do it for me.Definitely go here for a nice night out with good food.

I must say this is one of the nicest decorated Indian restaurants I have been to in my life. The atmosphere makes you want to eat here. This place specializes in South Indian cuisine hence the name Dosa. It was absolutely delicious. I had the lamb wrap which was spiced to perfection and filled with taste. The dosas here were crispy and the sambar and chutney hit the spot. Our server even though not Indian seemed well informed about the menu. The menu is a little pricey and the service was a little slow but overall great feel, great company and great food. :)

Dosa on Fillmore is doing something absolutely amazing with their cooking. I have often eaten Dosas, cuz it is a wonderful dish. But this restaurant has taken the entree to a new level and finesse, besides adding some very interesting and original ingredients.The decor and atmosphere inside is very classy and refined. As for the owners, Anjan and Emily, they are wonderful folks. The staff too is both polite and very informed on the food. Me and my group noticed that the staff was always very attentive to the customers, in the sense that wine glasses were never left empty and plates were picked up as soon as the meal was completed.In conclusion, I found Dosa on Fillmore to be a very pleasant dining experience. Great food, very affordable prices, attentive service, classy interior, subdued lighting and an overall excellent dining experience !!!

One star docked because the portions are kinda wimpy. It may have been our own fault, though, for opting for the uber-touristy four-course tasting menu. We clearly didn&#39;t take the time to think it through.Here&#39;s what we ordered:-Prawn Chile Fry + Crab Vada (starters)-Cilantro Mint Masala + Spicy Mung Masala (mini dosas)-Pepper Chicken + Lamb Kofta (South Indian curry)-Galub Jamoon + Rasmali (desserts)The amount served on the &#34;tasting menu&#34; is about 60% of its a la carte menu counterparts. How did we know this? We were being nosey Asian folks who gandered at all the dishes that arrived at every adjacent table. That&#39;s how.We then stared back at our own dosas and currys and noticed that we got jipped (or &#34;gypped&#34; if you prefer to side with racists). The dessert portion was a joke. I mean, I literally laughed when my Galub Jamoon arrived. It was a solitary ball of puffed dough floating all by its lonesome in sugar syrup. Sad sad sad.To be fair, other than the disappointing elf-food portions, Dosa serves scrumptious, well-prepared dishes. Just be sure to skip the tasting menu and order directly from the full menu. The waitstaff is friendly and knowledgeable, and the decor is beautiful. Also, note that the kitchen is open late- until midnight on Fri/Sat, 11pm on Sun-Thurs.

We ate here just a few weeks after they opened and we didn&#39;t enjoy our meal at all. Either Dosa in the Mission is far better or they were still just working out the kinks. The food wasn&#39;t as vividly flavored as at the other location and it wasn&#39;t fully hot when served.I think the makeover is the best part about this place. It was turned into a hip space from a boring old Goodwill store. Impressive renovation.

I don&#39;t usually think of Indian Food when I think of high-end restaurants, but Dosa is the best Indian Food I&#39;ve ever had and a great dining experience in general.First off, just the inital view of the restaurant is impressive. Very nice decor, very cool feel, looks like something you&#39;d see in a vegas casino.From there, the menu is outstanding. The cocktails were unique, the soups and appetizers were inspired and everything on the menu had a nice touch. They don&#39;t just serve meatballs, they serve Lamb Meatballs, which I had and which were fantastic. We also had some Dosa (how do you not order the namesake food?) and that was amazing as well. I don&#39;t really know what else to say. I had no real complaints, and I felt like almost everything on their menu would be well worth the price.This would be a great date spot and is a really good place for a double-date as well (not always things that coincide.)

I&#39;ve been wanting to try Dosa for some time now and finally got around to it. My overall feeling after dining here? I don&#39;t love it or hate it but doubt I&#39;ll be returning.It&#39;s definitely the most elegant &amp; upscale Indian restaurant I&#39;ve ever been to. The host and servers were all nice and not snooty given the high-end feel of the place. Our server was busy but overall prompt and nice so no complaints about the service.My dining companion and I ordered the Prawn Masala and Chicken Masala with plain Uttapam. Our entrees came out very quickly and our overall thoughts on our orders? It&#39;s &#34;ok&#34; but nothing that moved either of us. Be prepared because the curry was darn spicy which was not what our server told my friend when she informed him that she can&#39;t handle spicy.We both agreed we&#39;ll stick to more low end Indian restaurants that has Naan bread and Chicken Tiki Masala the next time we&#39;re craving some Indian food!

This review is for an engagement party that I recently threw at Dosa. I cannot say enough about the food, service, and professionalism of the staff. We worked closely with Dosa&#39;s event manager Daniel Dowdell, who is FANTASTIC. Daniel was kind, friendly, responsive to emails/calls, and always gave us an honest opinion about various aspects of the party. As a result, we had a fabulous menu, exceptional decor, and all of our guests had a blast. It went off without a hitch! Daniel was also present for the duration of the party and frequently checked in with me to ask how things are going, and ensured that the entire event went off smoothly. His bartender and wait staff were also awesome - very attentive to our guests and super accommodating. One of the children at our party had a serious nut allergy and the staff went to great lengths to cook her specific food that was nut-free, child-friendly, and still delicious.I would definitely throw another event at Dosa and if I could, I would give them ten stars!!! It is a perfect, beautiful venue for an engagement party (we had the upper mezzanine - very private), and the food is awesome.

Come for the Bar, stay for the Food.This is exactly what we did, wandering the local neighborhood we noticed the hopping bar and decided it was time for a drink or ten.Based on the crowd and great atmosphere, we decided to stay for a bite to eat. Honestly, we had no idea what type of food was being served (I suppose without the 4th drink we would have surmised from the decor), we took the lazy route often traveled by patrons of this restaurant and went with the tasting menu (as some of the yelpers have noted, it really is just tasting sized servings as well). I was even lazier and allowed the waiter to go with his favorites.With a bottle of wine for the table, great company and sharing what life had brought us over the past year, my friend and I totally enjoyed the experience. The waiter was spot on, just attentive enough but not annoying, the restaurant is comfortable and the food was great.

So I went over to goodwill to sell some old clothes and maybe buy something I can wear ironically and damn, look what they&#39;ve done. with the place. It&#39;s dim and elegantly decorated now. I didn&#39;t know it was possible to make a 10,000 square foot building feel intimate, but they&#39;ve done it. And it doesn&#39;t smell like old people anymore.And they&#39;re serving South Indian food. If you go you&#39;ll want to try the lamb kofta with rice on the side as it has this kind of lingering spiciness that I&#39;ve only tasted at the dosa on valencia. They recommend the lemon rice as an accompaniment, but I&#39;d go with plain basmati rice if I were doing it again; It isn&#39;t bad, but I don&#39;t think it adds much &amp; the flavor of the lamb (or anything else on the menu, I imagine) will stand on its own.I sampled the spring uttapam as well. It&#39;s good by itself, but its real value is as a delivery mechanism for the coconut chutney, which you may even want to scoop out of the ramekin with your fingers if you&#39;re not all hung up on social conventions.Service is good, not jaw-droppingly so like at the other dosa, but good. And they don&#39;t want anything to do with your bag of old clothes but they&#39;re nice about it.But it&#39;s a little steep, and I primarily come to goodwill because I&#39;m low on funds. I mean, if I&#39;m gonna drop seventeen on a little bowl of lamb meatballs, you could at least throw the rice in for free.It&#39;s worth a try if you haven&#39;t been there yet. And it turns out goodwill is actually across the street where they corner store with the weird taxidermy used to be. And that place still does smell like old people.

I had dinner with my friends on Friday night. We had to wait almost two hours to get a table. I don&#39;t know how their reservation system works but there were a couple of empty tables up front.In any case, the food was good. I had spicy Dosa that I liked and Peony cocktail. Loved both! The restaurant had a nice interior design and is great for larger groups. I would recommend it but just make sure that you are willing to wait longer for a table.

If you love pancakes with a plethora of veggies cooked in curry, this is the place to you.My friend and I did not know that &#34;Dosa&#34; apparently is the name of a common South Indian (which is the type of Indian place this is) food, like a pancake.If you love meat, don&#39;t come here, cuz there isn&#39;t a lot.My food was okay, but not worth the price. The atmosphere is pretentious, and if you are expecting your &#39;typical&#39; indian foods, you will not find them here. Almost everything is pancakes. And they got my friend&#39;s order wrong. 15 bucks for a wrap, like a shawerma, at lunch time.Don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be back! But a lot of folks come here, I got the vibe that it was the &#39;thing to do&#39;, not that the food was at all spectacular.

First of all I don&#39;t understand what is the big hype of this place! I have been to this place on several occasions with my family and have had the same mediocre service. Their food I feel like is to Americanized for the Indian tongue. As a Indian I expect having some tradition and love when eating my native cuisine. Dosa does a C- job on that. However I do find their Masala Dosa decent and their Mango Laasis top notch. I do appreciate the ambiance and hip urban feeling (due to the fact that it is located in a upcoming hip neighborhood). Another complaint I have is their prices. Overly expensive especially due to the small portions they serve. I would prefer to go to a small Indian restaurant where they give bigger portions and hotter food. Also the desserts are always cold and bland. I will only come back to this place when I have out of town guests dying for some Indian food. Other than that, won&#39;t be stepping into the doors for quite some time now.

Went there for a late dinner on a Sunday. Really cool decor, nice waiter, fun atmosphere, somewhat eclectic wine list.We were a little overwhelmed by the menu, there are a lot of choices and if you are not an Indian food buff you can get a little bit lost. However, the waiter told us what to order and we were all very happy with our food!.The Sunchoke Masala was soo good. My favorite thing was the chips at the beginning of the meal.I definitely recommend it and cant wait to go to their location in the Mission!

South Indian food is completely underrated, but utterly delicious cousin to the North Indian/Punjabi food that everyone is used to. This place isn&#39;t the most authentic, but it&#39;s not trying to be; it doesn&#39;t have to. if you just are curious what a dosa tastes like then go to Udupi Palace and pay $7. If you want to go go out on the night and grab a nice drink and eat some wholesome food this is your place.I&#39;d recommend Channai Chicken for the appetizer, and Masala Dosa, Rava Dosa, or Paper Dosa for mains.

I&#39;ve never been disappointed here. Been here many times, and its always been fun.They have really good Indian food. The Chennai chicken is awesome, so are their other small plates.Service and ambiance too deserve 5-stars.Last night they refused to replace the whisky in my cocktail because the drinks are made to suit the specific drink mentioned in the menu, the manager also came up to me and explained this, i was more convinced after I had the drink. Their cocktails are very different, excellent.Will continue to take my friends there whenever I can.

The food was good, the service was good, and the atmosphere was good.The paper dosa was crispy and I particularly enjoyed the spiced pototaos/onions it came with. The Channai Chicken was tender and complimented the yogurt. I particularly enjoyed the coconut rice and would probably skip the lemon rice (it was too tart for me).Overall it was a nice dinner, but a bit on the pricey side. However, sometimes paying a little extra for a comfortable and enjoyable experience is a good treat once in a while. But....I probably won&#39;t be going as often for the sake of my wallet.

This place is way to classy to be owned by an Indian person. Indian people are cheap and this was a two story restaurant with a chandelier. The greatest shortcoming was with the food, some dosas came precut for us, and it wasn&#39;t very filling for an Indian person in general. You can find the same quality food with a better portion at any other south indian place. I really like the environment and service though, and also the uniqueness of the dishes, it almost makes up for the food.

I&#39;ve been really looking forward to trying this place for awhile, as I&#39;m an Indian food connoisseur, but I was truly disappointed. We ordered 5 dishes between 2 people- nothing was memorable..The restaurant is in a great location and the service is good but the food really doesn&#39;t cut it, especially for the $$$.. If this place were in a mall food court and was under $10.00 out-the-door I would approve, unfortunately this is not the case.

I really didn&#39;t expect to love Dosa as much as I did. I typically have a hard time with Indian food due to the spice; I&#39;m very sensitive to it. When we sat down and looked over the menu, we all were just like, &#34;duh....&#34; like, no idea what the hell to order.The server was super helpful and started offering suggestions. We still just looked at her with a blank stare that said, &#34;I&#39;m not processing a word you&#39;re saying.&#34; My friend interrupted her and said, &#34;Ya know, we don&#39;t know what the hell you&#39;re talking about so could you just order everything you think we would dig?&#34;I will give both of them credit for this because 1) that was definitely the way to go and 2) everything she chose was AMAZING!! I&#39;m not going to lie, I can&#39;t remember a single name of any of the dishes with the exception of the Chicken Korma which was friggin&#39; awesome, btw.None of it was all that spicy (if I can deal with it then it must be pretty mild) although I believe they can alter most of the dishes to your preference.The interior is amazing with these beautiful delicate yet large chandeliers, modern furnishings, spacious bar and high ceilings. It reminded me of some of the restaurants in SOMA; it had a very grand feeling to it. The cocktails were also ridiculously good and unique. The mango drink I ordered was sweet at first taste and finished with a spicy kick. YUM!!!!I can&#39;t wait to try the one on Valencia as well! I&#39;ve heard rumblings it&#39;s even better which I find hard to believe!

I have yet to sit down and try something off of their &#34;more formal&#34; menu but the gin drinks, masala dosa and bhatura that we consumed at the bar were really enjoyable.The dosas and gigantic puffball bhatura make for a fun and interesting eating experience and cost like $10-15 each so you can throw more money at the bar.The ambiance is definitely the big selling point for me though - dosas don&#39;t really stir me up into a frenzy but sitting under GORGEOUS lighting fixtures certainly does.

This review is way overdue...about six months old, but better late than never.The BFF &amp; I came here specifically for their prix fixe menu a few months ago to sample several dishes, since it was our first time here.The decor really swept me off my feet; it&#39;s romantic &amp; modern &amp; very chic. The huge chandeliers, the tall ceilings &amp; the rich, bold colors don&#39;t exactly scream out &#34;India&#34; to me, but there&#39;s no denying this is a beautifully decorated restaurant with gorgeous details that elicits good table conversation.I always go with vegetarian options when I am trying new cuisines and/or restaurants. I started with lentil dumplings &amp; had the masala dosa as my entree (spiced potatoes-yum!) I don&#39;t remember what the BFF ordered or exactly what I had for dessert, only that it was an ice cream that I didn&#39;t care for.The prices are surprisingly inexpensive considering the experience &amp; portions you get. Definitely a fabulous place to get decent Indian food.

Everyone loves and talks about this place. This is a place where a lot of my friends bring in out-of-town guests. And then even the out-of-town guests go to this place on their own (later).I like this place too. This weekend, we spent a couple of hours here with some of our friends. We spent a good two hours there, way more than what I spend on dinner at other places. We definitely liked the ambiance, the presentation, the creativity of the menu. But actual implementation didn&#39;t quite stand up to the expectation. And I was certainly not evaluating the food on authenticity criteria, because I totally love the experimentation they do with the recipes. But I was disappointed because of some basic problems with the food. The vada in &#34;Dahi Vada&#34; tasted leathery, the sambar had too much salt and my wife&#39;s &#34;Rava Dosa&#34; was cold.

Came here on Friday after work for a snack and a drink before catching a movie at the Kabuki. I was a little put off when I sat down at the bar and asked for a happy hour menu and the barback told me it was Monday through Thursday- when I had called an hour prior to going there and the host that answered the phone said they definitely had it going on. So... anyways- The happy hour is Monday through Thursday.We ordered the Chennai Chicken appetizer and also Roasted Chile &amp; Garlic Masala DOSA round of drinks. I have to say the chicken was very good. The DOSA was pretty spicy so beware.The food was super yummy and will be back to try more.Just wish the phone hosts wouldve given me correct info - I wouldve given them another star.

I&#39;ve heard so many great things about Dosa. I&#39;m glad I finally tried it. Bf and I came here for happy hour which is from 5:30-7pm so we could try a variety of dishes Dosa had to offer. Turns out they only have four tapas sized dishes during HH for $5 each. We figured, might as well try all of them.Chennai Chicken - fried boneless organic chicken with coriander and cumin served with Straus yogurt. The chicken was so tender and juicy! I loved the spices on meat. I especially appreciated the smokiness and heat from the cumin since it made the chicken that much sweeter and delicious. The yogurt was a perfect compliment, cool and refreshing. YUM all the way!Blackened Sardines - rubbed and fried with green chiles, coriander, cumin, onions in lime juice. I was never really a big fan of sardines but these were super meaty and cumin again was a big factor in the taste department. The meat was cut diagonally so you could easily fork it into your mouth.Blackened Spiced Corn - grilled sweet corn, rubbed with cayenne, salt and lime. This corn was spicy HOT but the lime and sweetness of the corn was a nice contrast. I don&#39;t normally enjoy food this spicy but I did like this one. However, the portion was pretty ridiculous. Did I really just pay $5 for an ear of corn?Mung Sprouts - sprouted lentils, tomatoes, cucumbers, ginger, grated coconut, seasoned with chile &amp;amp; mustard seed oil. Maybe I just don&#39;t like lentils that much but this was kind of a blah dish to me. It was nicely refreshing with all the spicy dishes we got but there wasn&#39;t anything really special about it. I didn&#39;t taste any coconut either like it promised on the menu.We still wanted a little bit more so we ordered an entree to share:Tamil Lamb Curry - Free-range and natural lamb, fennel, tomatoes, poppy seeds, caramelized onions and spices. SO DELICIOUS! The lamb was perfect: succulent and sensational. I honestly think I could eat this everyday and not get sick of it. The side of lemon rice we ordered was more citrus than just lemon. I&#39;m glad it was recommended with this curry.On top of the wonderful food and the beautiful atmosphere, Dosa is environmentally concious about their food, equipment, furnishings and even bathrooms. Yay for Indian food and going green!

We ate here over the NYE holiday and had to fight for a seat at the bar, which I suppose is typical in the city over a holiday. The food was great, but not mind-blowing, which I thought it should be for the price. When we asked the bartender for recommendations, he simply recommended all the most expensive items, which I thought was a little contrived. Our meal was delicious and the interior is very nice - sleek and elegant, very swanky, and being able to walk right to the Fillmore to see a show afterwards was great as well.

Cocktails for lunch anyone? I was having a particularly languid morning until I met some friends at Dosa and one thing led to another and next thing I knew the I had the Bowler in hand, and pisco, mango and a kick of spice that sent me into another orbit altogether.Johnny of Absinthe put together their drink menu, and I can attest that it&#39;s one you won&#39;t easily get bored with. Luscious juices and exotic spices from other lands take your tongue on a wild ride through mysterious place and tempt you to order just. one. more.Luckily, a round of frankies brought us back down to earth. I can see why this traditional Indian street food is so addictive. The roti bread was soft and warm and the sauce was comforting and tangy. The Mung Sprout salad was delicious and refreshing and the perfect counterpart to the lovely comfort food.They should definitely jump on the street food bandwagon with a cocktails n&#39; frankies cart, no? How does one get a license for a cocktail cart anyway? *sigh*

I&#39;m a huge fan of South Indian food, so even a South Indian restaurant of poor quality would probably rate highly in my book. Nevertheless, Dosa sets itself apart with great service and a nice atmosphere inside. Didn&#39;t have a reservation and was told over the phone that it would be a 35-minute wait, but when we arrived 10 minutes later we were seated immediately ... nice. The dosa was light and crispy on the outside and all of the curries were solid. Uttapam very good. I will say that my partner rated the mango lassi below that of Shalimar, so, money can&#39;t buy everything I suppose.Overall a very nice night; hope to return soon.

I&#39;ve been working with Dan, the event manager for Dosa for a few days finalizing the reservation for a large party. I have to say, it&#39;s been both an easy and pleasurable experience. He&#39;s been able to accommodate our very particular expectations and has been flexible and helpful to make sure our group has the best dining experience possible. I&#39;d highly recommend Dosa for a large group!

Hands down, Dosa has the best Indian food in the city! Personally, I prefer the ambiance at the Dosa on Valencia Street, but both locations have great food and service.We ordered the Vegetarian Slider. It really is like a burger slider without the meat. Instead of burger, you get a spiced potato patty inside a bun. The coolest part is that they give you seasoning to sprinkle into the ghee (butter) so you can dip your slider into it. Yum!I also recommend the South Indian lamb kofta and the Massala Chutney Dosa. Unbelievable!If you aren&#39;t a germaphobe, go family style and don&#39;t be afraid to get your hands dirty. You&#39;ll be glad you did.The only negative is that it is a little expensive. But Dosa claims to be the only South Indian restaurant in the city, and there is a big difference between South Indian food and the other Indian restaurants in the city. South Indian food seems more like banquet style cuisine.

Went to the restaurant for Dine About Town, and chose their prefix menu. We were there at 5.30pm and got seated almost immediately...always a plus, but to be expected at such an early time.The waitress was with us fast, we didnt have to wait long for the food, and although the portions didn&#39;t look any big to the eyes, they were more than big enough for the stomach! We were so stuffed by the end of all the courses!Only minus was the desserts, we tried different ones, and I did not like any of them. Other than that, a decent restaurant I would recommend coming to. I liked the layout of it.

To; the server girl that was working on Sunday;&#34;Look, i know you&#39;re tired and all that weight on you isn&#39;t helping your ankles but you dont have to rush our dinner just because you want to get off from work&#34;My experience here wasn&#39;t up to par with what i expected. I brought my boyfriend out to SF and specifically had plenty of &#39;birthday dinner&#39; options, but decided on this one because i saw all the great reviews.First of all- the dosa&#39;s are soggy. They look like burritos! So i think Dosa truck from LA and &#39;Dosa on Fillmore&#39; should sell burritos instead.Food was okay and service made it worse.

Hurray for Bollywood! A gorgeous glamarama setting brings spicy fun and full on flavor for dinner on a lively Saturday night. Fragrant spices envelop you upon entering, like an olfactory elevator transporting you to a sensual South Indian feast.BF and I both chose Bengali Gimlets for a pre-diner cocktail. Concocted with Tanqueray Rangpur Gin, &#39;curried&#39; nectar, Kaffir lime leaf and lime juice served up with a wedge of lime, the result was a luscious, tingly elixir. I had another with dinner and it paired perfectly.Portions were super generous (sharing is definitely the way to go) and service was smooth. Our meal started off with coconut &amp; roasted bell pepper soup with cauliflower, cumin and chilies. Wonderfully delicate and so delicious, it was my favorite dish.The Chutney Masala Dosa was huge and satisfying. A meal in itself to be honest. The Jumbo Prawns Masala Curry was spicy enough to make you salivate but not overly so to make you sting. Finished off with something sweet and pleasant that I can&#39;t seem to recall at the moment. They were out of Galub Jamoon so they subbed something else and we ate it. Happily.I left glowing and satiated, feeling like I had experienced more than just a great meal. It was an elegant evening immersed in a magical environment; an award winner for sure.

The food was truly so-so (except for the kale and mungbean salad) but what made the night most unpleasant was the over-invasive waiting staff whisking away everything on the table the second they assumed you were done without even bothering to ask you. Doubt I&#39;ll be back.

I rarely give a 5 star review but Dosa is deserving. It is a fabulous Indian restaurant. I&#39;ve now been fortunate to eat there 3 different times. Each meal has been equally good with excellent service.The restaurant is gorgeous. I remember when the location was a crappy Goodwill so it&#39;s very impressive what they did with the interior remodel.I&#39;ve tried many different things on the menu and the Dosas are some of my favorite items. They are big so make sure to ask the wait staff about suggested portions for the meal. We were there for New Year&#39;s Eve and had a 4 course meal. I can eat a lot but there was way too much food. The good news is that everything was delicious. Another favorite is the Red Beet Croquette. They also have wonderful coconut rice. I could go on and on about the food.I hope to have many more great dining experiences at Dosa and to be able to try more items!

If I could give this place negative stars I would!I live close, and always saw the line of people outside. As some one who loves Indian food, I though this restaurant would be perfect for an evening out. I made reservations, because the wait time was at least 30min every time we came as walk ins. We were seated quickly, in a very nice table near a window. The interior was gorgeous, the colors and the walls, it&#39;s very well decorated. I eat Indian food all the time, but I had a hard time even deciphering the menu. So we decided to order a few dishes and share. The waiter was NO help and was totally spaced out.we ordered Veggie Curry, and a Chicken rice dish.They were under spiced, and tasted exactly the same. The curry was like a horrible version of Japanese Curry. The rice was a plating disaster. it was a pile of rice with a chicken drumstick sticking straight up, very unappetizing.This food is NOT indian!for half the price you can go down the block to Indian Palace and for about $10 have all you can eat buffet.

Hats off for creativity!This has got to be one of the BEST Indian-fusion places in town. The thing that makes the food here mind-blowing is that while all the flavors are authentic South Indian, there is also a slight twist that always come as a delightful surprise to my husband and I who simply love this place. We always order the Vada Pav and I love their Paneer Watermelon Salad and their Idiyappam. Of course, we never forget to try one of their dosas - which have never failed to disappoint with their crispiness and taste!

There are certain things in life that in my opinion make me among the luckiest people on the planet. It is not money or fame (neither of which I possess in great quantity unless you count my Yelp Elite &#39;11 status) but rather the luxury of eating what truly must be some of the best food in the world right here in my own city. I have become so spoiled by this that I rarely even get worked up anymore over the latest hot spots. Dosa though has me back in that place where I am just in awe of how awesome food can be if done right.As usual I won&#39;t go into boring details about service or ambience. To me what matters is what comes out on the plate. I have been a fan of Dosa both on Valencia as one of the early followers and on Fillmore but have not been a regular in a few years. I can only describe the food as some of the best you will ever have anywhere, and if you are a fan of Indian, quite possibly the best you will ever experience. It is gourmet, beautifully presented and jaw droppingly delicious, every time.New on the menu: white truffle dosa and spicy basil dosa. I tried both and was lost in ecstasy. Food can&#39;t possibly be this good but it is at Dosa. Can&#39;t wait to go back.

rating? 3.5/5Well i came here Friday evening for Dine about town and i just wanted to let yelpers know what it is like here.Think Osha thai but for Indian food. This ain&#39;t your normal northern india meal with Naan and normally curry it is Dosa and there is some curry.Food was fresh and good and if you sort of want a hopping scene in the fillmore this place is ok.But lets be honest, this place is a factory, my dining experience (not food) just wasn&#39;t up to par and i&#39;m probably not going to come back here. Tables are set so close that i heard both conversations to each side and i didn&#39;t&#39; even want to have a conversation with my date because if i can hear other&#39;s conversations they can hear mine.But food and service both fine. Food fresh, service nice and quick and attentive. Feel the restaurant is like a factory and makes me feel as if the restaurant has no soul. I will have to try the mission one because i heard that one is much better.

Dosa was fantastic. My boyfriend and I ordered off of the pre-fixed tasting menu, which was a little less daunting than the main menu. For the appetizer, I got the seafood vada. It was alright, not a HUGE fan, but I liked it for the most part. The mini dosa was probably my favorite part of the meal. I got the Paneer and Peas dosa, which was not only the perfect size, but the chutneys were incredible! Such succulent flavors... I also tried a bit of my boyfriend&#39;s Cilantro-Mint Masala and it was sooo good!I also had the vegetable curry, which was kind of unmemorable. It was too spicy for me, but I guess I should have anticipated that with South Indian food! The dessert was SOOO good - I got the passion fruit custard, and I would highly recommend it.Overall, the decor inside was absolutely beautiful. We came without a reservation on a Saturday night, which was not smart. I would definitely recommend making a reservation beforehand. However, we only waited about 10-15 minutes before two seats at their large communal table opened up. Within half an hour of sitting down, the restaurant had cleared significantly. Last, Dosa&#39;s location is perfect for a date night, because Kabuki Sundance Theaters are right across the street! Great night and great food. Thanks, Dosa!

If you like actual Indian food, do not eat here - you WILL be disappointed. If you have never had real Indian you might like this place. It is &#34;fusion&#34;, which means its American food that looks like Indian food. Moreover, its American food with a bunch of pepper in it to make it &#34;spicy&#34;.I do not recommend this to anyone who is in the mood for Indian. I do recommend this place to anyone who doesn&#39;t like Indian food but wants to pretend they do.

A very good meal. I went with a few friends and each had a bit of the set course menu. Together we sample a good portion of the menu. To be honest I can&#39;t recall many of the names of the dishes, but I can say all of it except the dessert were delicious. The desserts were universally bad. Portion sizes are erratic going from slightly large to huge to reasonable. I would advise ordering off the regular menu and skipping dessert.Cocktails were hit or miss. We tried nearly the whole list and two or three were quite good. The others were flat, too sweet or just didn&#39;t taste good.Service is lackluster. Justifiably popular tables are awkwardly squeezed near a over crowded bar. Drinks and plates are taken before we were finished often without so much of a &#34;Are you finished?&#34; As they have their hand on my plate or glass.Still I would certainly return for another meal.

Unfortunately, this will be one of those &#34;I&#39;m not familiar with the roots of this food nor have a sizable sample size for comparison&#34; but damn were my meals here amazing. I&#39;ve probably tried most of their Dosas and I haven&#39;t really found one that I didn&#39;t like. In fact, I like the Paper Dosa the most and really love their Sambar. I would highly recommend that you try this place out for a tasty adventure into a less-than-common type of Indian food in a swank atmosphere.Don&#39;t forget to get your parking validated.

I could tell from the get-go that Dosa was going to be really, really good. Our interest peaked by the beautiful chandeliers, we walked across the street to peek in the windows. Every table was filled late on a Friday night, and everyone seemed to be eating happily.We called for a reservation the following afternoon, and were told that we couldn&#39;t be seated until 10:00. Wow, talk about popular.We eat got the tasting menu, which turned out to be much bigger portions than we were expecting. Everything we eat had was amazing.

While Dosa is nominally an Indian restaurant, it shouldn&#39;t be confused with the lunch buffet places in Silicon Valley that are quite common and not all that interesting.Dosa is more &#34;Indian Fusion&#34; with fancy cocktails, great service and original dishes with an Indian flare.The ratings for this establishment definitely suffer from SF snobbery. This would be a five-star restaurant anywhere else in the Bay.

Like any good American, I&#39;m on an endless quest to silence my thinking. I&#39;m plagued by profound thoughts. I hate it. My brain keeps asking questions with no quickly attributable answers.&#34;Why are we here?&#34;And while I could drink and smoke myself silly, or watch Spiderman 3 again, my brain would only cease for a few hours at best... and the hangover would suck.&#34;Is love just a rationalization of chemical reactions?&#34;Enter, brunch at Dosa on Fillmore. Sunny. Conveniently located (to me). Large, with ample service. Great service in an ambient and beautiful interior that will make you feel like the sultan of some third-world country whose name I can&#39;t pronounce.&#34;Are the farmers of Argentina being properly represented?&#34;I can feel it go. A vacation for the brain. The Mini Dosa and side combination allows one to sample a variety of dishes. Our host rightfully recommended the Mung Sprouts salad (amazingly refreshing and light) and the Coconut and Roasted Bell Pepper soup (smooth and flavorful).&#34;I wonder how much of the stuff in the Goodwill across the street is made in Taiwan...&#34;I greatly preferred the Chutney Masala Dosa to the buckwheat-based, Rava Masala Dosa. Much smoother. Honestly, though, I didn&#39;t really taste anything but potatoes inside. Oh, well.&#34;That one dips in brown sauce before white sauce seems to represent the social inequities of race... The hostess is pretteh...&#34;Perhaps most fantastic was the Chicken &#34;Dumm&#34; Biryani - Savory organic chicken falling off the bone on a perfectly seasoned bed of basmanti rice with chilies, onion, garlic, ginger and spices.&#34;Ginger tastes like the word &#34;zing!&#34; Whee...&#34;If you&#39;re still coherent after that oral stimulus package, the Toasted Coconut and Saffron Barfi will seal the deal... and you&#39;ll be left dumbfounded and smiling with your belt buckle broken and your finger up for the check.&#34;Food in mouth... good...&#34;

Let me start off by saying that I&#39;ve never been to India, so I have no idea what &#34;authentic&#34; Indian cuisine is. I know know what I like, and I really like Dosa.I had some friends in town and they suggested we have dinner and drinks at Dosa. We decided to do the get several things and we all shared them. We started with drinks. I had the Emerald Sound and I have to say I loved it. I don&#39;t know what my friends drank, but managed to have every drink on the menu. Some were exquisite, others not so much. That&#39;s ok, because there are many types of alcohol I don&#39;t like.We ordered Samosas and they were tasty. We then did the uttapam sampler. The lentil dipping was incredible as well as the different flavors of the uttapam. Actually all the dipping sauces were good. We then went for the cliantro/mint dosa which was delicious as well. The potatoes were spiced but not spicy, which is my preference.We finished with dessert. We all three had the banana cream pie, the chocolate cherry cake with spiced ice cream and the passion fruit tapioca. They were all good, but a little disconnected from the rest of the menu. While the drinks and food had a very distinct flavor, the desserts did not. Our waiter said that originally, they only had a few Indian desserts on the menu, but they didn&#39;t do that well and had another pastry chef come up with those. While they were tasty none the less, I think the chocolate cherry cake came the closest to fitting in with the spiced ice cream which did compliment the meal nicely. However, the passion fruit tapioca was light and fluffy and did suit being the finale in a spicy meal.So, I highly recommend Dosa. I did knock off a star for high prices and not a convenient location for me, but it is an excellent restaurant for vegetarians and the drinks are yummy and original. I will go there again.

I&#39;d heard mixed things about Dosa but as an Indian/Paki food connoisseur, I had to give it a shot. My husband and I did the tasting menu so that we could try a little of everything and the break down went something like this...1. The modern twist on appetizers is refreshing, fun and delicious.2. The dosas are massive and could basically be your entire meal...they are cooked to perfection and the accompanying chutneys are the bomb (yes I just said that).3. The curries are good, but definitely Americanized and a little too pretty for my taste.4. The desserts are awesome. I love the cardamom chocolate gelato!5. The service and decor are great. Really fun, inviting and good for groups.

Dinner here last night teetered on the edge between a 3 and 4. Defining moments that keep my rating restrained include consistently slow service ... and a gross stir caused when James Van Der Beek entered the restaurant. I cannot, in good conscience, issue four stars to any establishment whose patrons become audibly excited by anyone from &#39;the Creek.&#39; However -- despite his inattentive moments, our server was extremely knowledgeable, and the $39 per person, 4-course tasting menu is a great way to sample a variety of offerings (if you&#39;re with a group). But the real star of the show is the ambiance. It&#39;s SO warm and beautifully appointed inside that it is downright compelling to anyone passing by. Walk by and see for yourself how it makes you just want to be a part of the action inside. Hands-down, this has to be the most impressivetransformation of any former Goodwill store on the planet.

We saw our waitress once that was to order our food , The only people we came in contact with were the bussers. after we were finish eating we waited about 15 min. and still no waitress. i had to get up and go to the hostess desk to ask for our check.our waitress finally comes back with a nasty attitude and drops ( literally drops) the check at our table no eye contact just kept walking.A bad waitress can really ruin your dining experiencei love the food but i will not be coming back

Crowded place on a Saturday night. That said, the bar seating opened up by the time we wrapped up our first round of drinks. Tried the spinach &amp; fennel dosa at the recommendation of the bartender. Delicious! Came with a spicy sauce, and tomato and coconut dips. Yum. Also got a lentil &amp; sprout salad, fresh, non-oily and d-e-l-i-c-i-o-u-s. The woman next to me at the bar said that Dosa&#39;s cocktails are amazing. I was having a wine night so I guess I&#39;ll just have to try the cocktails another night soon.

Dosa came highly recommended to us and lived up to the hype. It was very crowded but we had a reservation and only had to wait about 10 minutes for our table. I had a vegetable curry dish and my wife had a dosa and both were delicious. The service was very good, the atmosphere was pleasant. I would definitely go here again on my next trip to SF.

Top to bottom, OUTSTANDING! From the North &amp; South Samosa, Kerala Fish Moilee, Spicy Mung Marsala Dosa ... Up to the Coconut Custard Cake, all very-very good. A must visit in the Fillmore.

My short and sweet review:I got here around 7 on a Thursday (with a reservation) and waited for about 20 minutes to be seated.Atmosphere/decor were amazing; modern, sleek and a wonderful spot for a date. Parking was decent, with free meters in the area after 6.Every single piece of food that my group of four had here was excellent; the waiter was informative and the appetizers/main course were great.If you&#39;re looking for cocktails, be prepared to pay.THE SCOOP: Any of the dosas are great, the prices are moderate and the ambiance is perfect for a date night.

I came here during ad:Tech SF with one of our account rep - he said it was one of his favorite restaurants. :) OK...I&#39;m not picky when it comes to food and I&#39;m always up for trying something new!Now, I&#39;m no Indian food rookie, so when people mention it, I&#39;m always game. He suggested DOSA on Fillmore as the place to meet. I&#39;ll admit...I was enchanted from the moment I walked in the front door. Everything was tastefully chosen and every aspect of the decor blended seamlessly with the next. I also learned that the entire restaurant was designed with eco-friendly characteristics (from the wood accents to the &#34;XLERATOR&#34; hand dryer in the bathroom).Since our rep was friends with the owner, we basically went &#34;omakase&#34; with our order...and compliments to the chef! I don&#39;t remember exactly what everything was called, but in summary... we had some great dishes (this isn&#39;t everything, I just really can&#39;t remember!): beet soup, a whole fish, lamb chops (which had GREAT flavor - almost kalbi-esque), coconut gelato and mango sorbet.Good stuff. I&#39;ll have to return! Dhanyavaad, Dosa!-

I heard about Dosa from my best friend who doesn&#39;t like Indian food, so of course I had to check it out! This place is swanky and has beautiful decor, not like your typical hole in the wall Indian restaurant I&#39;m used to. My coworker and I did the tasting menu so we could sample a good portion of their best dishes, and we were impressed!We started off with the chennai chicken which everyone recommends. It was cooked well - fried with good texture but still moist inside, and I thoroughly enjoyed the flavors. My coworker had the scallops which were very flavorful albeit small. Next I had the chutney dosa and he had the tomato onion and green chile uttapam. the dosa was amazing, the breading was soft, and the filling was savory. the uttapam was delicious, but those green chiles were spicy! i couldn&#39;t finish it all, i can only handle mild. our last course was the veg curry which came in a yellow curry sauce that was mild. i loved this curry, but any yellow curry is my favorite. he had the indian lamb kofta which comes in a tomato sauce. i didn&#39;t care for that one but am not a fan of red meat and thought the sauce was a bit heavy. we had amazing cardamom ice cream for dessert and i had a mango lassi which was ok, a bit thick.overall i absolutely would come back, but more to impress a friend or take out a client. it&#39;s not an every day type of restaurant, and you can get indian food cheaper nearby.

A few weeks ago, I was outed as someone who &#34;writes novella-sized reviews that often mention his genitalia or gay sex&#34; in an SF Weekly article about Yelp.Granted, none of this is bad -- in fact, it&#39;s pretty accurate (though for the record I talk more about OTHER people&#39;s genitalia). But I was surprised to be in the article since the author never met or interviewed me. Had she done so, she would have seen that I&#39;m sweet, well-mannered, and considerate (to a fault) in real life. Okay, so I talk about dick from time to time. Shut the fuck up.I tend to speculate, so I wondered what it would have been like if I had been interviewed. Say, if I met the author for dinner at Dosa on Fillmore instead of my friend. Surely she would have seen that I&#39;m not this raving cock-starved lunatic with a perma-erection and Tourette&#39;s, right? Then I remembered journalists are people. And, like most people, they have already made up some bullshit narrative about you. Once ossified, very little can break the lineaments of character, even if they happen to be untrue. I could have been more charming than Oscar Wilde or more cultured than a milk product, but her story about me still would have prevailed.Me: Wow! I think the folks at Dosa have done a great job making a very large space cozy and welcoming. I approve.Article Author: &#34;I met Darin over drinks and dinner at Dosa. Always cognizant of the merits of making a grand entrance, he quickly sashayed through the heavy wooden doors like Liberace on coke, trailing his scarf behind him. As he took in his surroundings, he squealed with glee and mused that the large, open dining area reminded him of his distended asshole after getting tag-teamed by the Mormon Tabernacle Choir.&#34;Me: Aside from the different art mediums on display here -- photography, painting, sculpture -- I truly love those marvelous LED light sculptures/chandeliers designed by Sharon Marston, you know, the threaded metal ones resembling dust clouds in the front window? Beautiful and environmentally responsible to boot.AA: &#34;Those chandeliers make my dick hard. FUUUUUUUCK.&#34;Me: The North/South Samosas are very good. The only problem? I had a hard time tasting the difference between the &#34;North&#34; Samosa (spiced potatoes) and &#34;South&#34; Samosa (caramelized onions and veggies).AA: &#34;Clearly unimpressed with the samosas, Darin stuck his hand down his throat and tried to puke it up for the server in order to register his disapproval.&#34;Me: Now, the Mysore Masala Dosa? Top notch. The light spread of the lentils within; the spongy Dosa bread as it absorbs the spices from the sambar -- Good God! If it wasn&#39;t for the refreshing coconut chutney my mouth would be on FIRE right now.AA: &#34;The Mysore Masala Dosa reminded Darin of the time an overzealous Rice Queen spread Sriracha cock sauce on his anus. &#39;Surprisingly,&#39; he said, &#39;it had a numbing effect. Which, really, was the best thing because I didn&#39;t give a fuck about this guy and the less I felt, the better.&#39;&#34;Me: My Tamil Lamb Curry is extremely well-prepared, though fennel detractors should avoid it since that&#39;s the strongest note. But the chunks of lamb are sizable and very tender.AA: &#34;Ever fuck sheep?&#34;Me: I really loved our server, Jenny. She was professional, helpful, informative, and friendly -- excellent service. Totally fine with leaving a sizable tip on the $78 bill. It&#39;s a little pricey, but considering we ordered enough food for 3 or 4 people, completely acceptable.AA: &#34;When the check came, Darin glanced at it and started fuming. &#39;I&#39;m sorry, but why weren&#39;t we comped for anything?&#39; he asked our hapless server. &#39;Do you motherfuckers have any IDEA who I am?!? I AM IMPORTANT!! ME! ME! ME! I&#39;M DARIN I., BITCHES! HOW DARE YOU NOT GIVE ME A DISCOUNT!! YOU BETTA TELL YOUR MANAGER TO DRAG THEIR ASS HERE BECAUSE, YEAH, YOU FOLKS ARE GONNA HAVE A BIG FUCKING PROBLEM ON YOUR HANDS WHEN I START SLINGING ONE-STAR SHIT ON THE INTERWEBS UNLESS I GET THOSE FUCKING SAMOSAS REMOVED FROM THIS BILL!!!!!&#39;&#34;Anyway, I highly recommend Dosa on Fillmore. And I challenge the author of the article to a mud wrestling match...TO THE DEATH.

Just went to the Fillmore location and have to say it was ok. I always enjoyed their place in the Mission and really like dipping the crepe stuff into the curry stuff.Always thought this place was a bit on the high dollar side though considering:a) I just had a couple of drinks, couple of appetizers and an entree for $100+!b) Some of the other options around Japantown are less expensive.c) when it comes right down to it, I&#39;m just buying spicy flavored potatos and bread after all, right?! :)Alright, I&#39;ll admit it&#39;s a bit more than just potatos, you get the flavors and culture and atmosphere. And I will say the food is quite tasty and my date really enjoyed it. And I totally get the whole &#34;experiencing South Indian cuisine&#34; thing. It&#39;s all good. I liked it.They should have had beer on tap though. That&#39;s kind of a big deal for me.

Oh, Dosa, we are soooo over!We had a reservation for 8:30 for 9 people. They didn&#39;t seat us until 9:15 cuz our table wasn&#39;t ready. They didn&#39;t really give us updates on the situation, we had to keep asking, and then at the manager(?) apologized but, no, he didn&#39;t comp our drink or offer appetizers since we had waited so long.The service at the table was slow. I asked for a sampler of their sauces/chutneys for the pappadum. They&#39;ve given it to us before. The waitress made a face and it took forever to come out.So finally after 2 hours of slow service, mediocre food, and waiting the 45 min for the damn table the other manager(?) offered free dessert. By that time half our group was on the verge of missing their movie so they left. Three of us got desserive and the chocolate cherry cake sucked.PS I think they&#39;re racist against all Indian groups.

Tried this location and it was great! The one on Valencia is more dim in it&#39;s lighting, but the food is just as good. You really can&#39;t go wrong with either one. The staff was real nice and helpful in choosing dishes since i wasn&#39;t too familiar with the menu items.Tried the frankie and the cauliflower and it was quite yummy. Loved the pompoms!The atmosphere is definitely a hangout for after work drinks or a nite on the town. It is upscale enough that you can be casual or slightly dressed up and you won&#39;t stand out!

This place is all show and no substance. The FOOD IS OVER-PRICED and average in taste. The flavorless chennai chicken costs fucking ten dollars and is just three tiny pieces of chicken . They add some random chutney to make the plate look full but seriously?? Ten dollars for that bullshit. NOT WORTH IT.The dosa here is again some strange concoction. Nothing like the Dosa from India. Please go to Udupi Palace for a taste of what Dosa is really like. The DOSA&#39;S DOSA IS YUCK!Moreover, their service needs much to be desired as well. They think they can distract their customers with the chandeliers and ambiance but you know when your server does not give a fuck. Mine didn&#39;t. She kind of hated being there it seemed. SERVICE SUCKS.You know what this place is--it is a token Indian restaurant for the rich white SF people. It serves India, or rather, an altered image of India (the kind those rich white people want to envision --the India of the Maharajas and the elephants) and serves it on a plate--in a flavorless but much exotified manner.No Flavor, no authenticity, awful service, awful place!Boo to you, Dosa.

I finally returned to Dosa on Fillmore for dinner and left with mixed emotions. We decided to go all out and try the tasting menu which seemed like a deal at $39. For the most part the food was still fantastic - especially the Chennai Chicken which should be banned in 47 states for being so damned addictive. My Prawn Chile Fry was ok, portion seemed a bit skimpy (especially when compared to the mound of crack chicken that my friend had) I went with the Paneer &amp; Peas mini Dosa and Lamb Curry to round out my meal - both were really good.Let me back track a bit - the majority of our table decided to do the wine pairing with the tasting menu and all agreed that it was a mistake. The pours were pretty skimpy and while the menu said &#34;Select one half glass with each course&#34; it actually only came with the first three courses. So for $18 we basically got 1.5 glasses of wine...and what we got was pretty much forgettable and didn&#39;t pair well with the spicy fare. Next time I will definitely stick with beer!Ok, last complaint - desserts. The five of us tried three different desserts and again all agreed that they were the low point of the meal. We left the plates half eaten which never happens with our group and dessert!Overall I actually feel like Dosa is more like a 3.5 star restaurant. Prices can definitely creep up (we spent $80 a person on dinner not counting our first round of cocktails at the bar) but for the most part the food is pretty good. My suggestion - skip the tasting menu and dessert and pick a couple of items to share...that way you won&#39;t leave disappointed as we did.

Seriously, being a south Indian I know what good south Indian food is, and dosa definitely was a big let down!! I read a lot of rave reviews so decided to check it out. I have been to dosa a couple of times now and feel that its way over priced for south Indian cuisine and whats really terrible is the fact that none of the dishes come close to authentic south Indian cuisine!!If you are looking for a fancy place and south indian food for the sake of it then go for it. But otherwise, invest some time and head off to any south bay restaurants- way cheaper and tastier food!So they 3 stars- well, great ambience and good service- pity the food is so unimpressive!

My friends put together a fabulous bachelorette party dinner for me here, so I guess I should be writing a Yelp review of my friends. Since I can&#39;t, I&#39;ll just sing the praises of the &#34;new&#34; branch of Dosa.Yeah, yeah, the food is somewhat &#34;nontraditional,&#34; but it&#39;s GOOD. Cheers to this Dosa for having a full bar with yummy cocktails (I had far too many of the Bollywood Hills, but they were so good!) and for the beautiful space.Great date spot!

We are spoilt as we have lived in the UK for many years before relocating to San Francisco and UK is the best for Indian food, but DOSA is the best you can get in San Fran (or the best we have found so far). The deco is great, people friendly and food is good.

My experience at Dosa, on two separate occasions, was tarnished by their horrible service. In the first instance, the waitress would correct my Indian pronunciation of the South Indian dishes with her warped Americanized notion of how they are pronounced. In the second instance, the waitress acted like I was wasting her time.I really really wish that the owner would have a sit down with his staff and address the basic issue of how to be gracious around guests.And if you don&#39;t care about being treated like shit--the food is good.

Very, very good. everything we had sitting at the bar (about 3 or 4 dishes) we&#39;re all excellent. As well the Pinot Noir was exactly my flavor. On top of that, the bartender and servers we&#39;re excellent. The bartender took the initiative and made sure we had everything we needed without asking. To me, that will make up for anything that is off... and nothing was off. Everything was spot-on.Just get there before 6 or you will never get a seat...

I&#39;ve been a few times- tasty food, if slightly over priced before seeing a movie at Kabuki.In any event, I made an Opentable reservation for 7 for tomorrow- I received a confirmation call today from Dosa, and asked very politely if I could squeeze 8 at the table. I got the least friendly response of &#39;Well, the reason you couldn&#39;t get an Opentable reservation for 8 is because the table only seats 7. If you are going to have 8, we will have to find another time for you to dine. It&#39;s definitely going to be later.&#39; There was no suggested time, solution-oriented chipper tone, etc. Nada.This is 30 hours in advance at Dosa on Wednesday night- are you kidding?To rub it in, we literally just walked into far superior Frances this evening and had the nicest meal at the bar- appears Dosa doesn&#39;t care about its patrons; so I guess they don&#39;t care about the cancellation I just dialed in for tomorrow!!

I thought the company was the best part. Oh and the decor of Dosa - very lovely.They seated the 4 of us at a tiny table (in the front) where we were hardly able to place all the food on the table.. They had to bring it out in intervals. I mean really!The service was mediocre. I think she forgot about us a few times.The food was just ok. I won&#39;t go back. Too many great places in SF, no need to return to this one.

Architecturally, this place knows how to make a good impression. As a confession, I didn&#39;t even know what a dosa was before coming here. I used to live in the Western Addition and have probably walked by this spot dozens and dozens of times. It&#39;s hard for me to believe that Dosa used to be a Goodwill store. Yes, its remodel really is that good.Luckily, its location and decorations isn&#39;t the only thing that&#39;s fabulous about Dosa - the menu definitely doesn&#39;t disappoint. I had the biggest Indian crepe, (also known as a DOSA) here last night and enjoyed my meal inside the restaurant&#39;s upstairs section. The upstairs eating section is much more intimate than the ground floor. Sitting upstairs places you in arms length to a private bar, and it gives you a great view of diners eating below on the bottom floor.The ambiance is dark in here, the lights are dim and small votive candles are placed at your table to give off an intimate feeling. Probably best to bring a date or some close friends.The culinary stars of my dinner last night were without a doubt the Red Beet Soup and the chutney&#39;s that came with the North and South Samosas. I loved the spices that slowly burn your mouth and turn your tongue into jelly. The spicy dosa I ordered was really fun to eat dipped into the lentil dipping soup it comes with. It may be primal of me, but I&#39;ve just always loved eating food with my hands. It just seems like a dosa is just perfect for that since it&#39;s essentially an Indian version of a crepe. I&#39;ll definitely be back - after all, there&#39;s just so much more to the menu to try.

I thought the food was terrific. Very different from any Indian food I had experienced. The dosa was made of lentils and there were many other non-wheat selections (they even have a gluten-free menu) which I appreciated. The prices also seemed moderate for an ample amount at lunch.It was conveniently right across the street from the movie theatre at Japantown where we went afterwards. All in all a pleasant experience with a nice atmosphere and helpful wait staff.

Well, I&#39;m back visiting the Bay Area since my sister moved here, and she took us to this new restaurant. It was nice and clean.But the service was atrocious. The hostess ignored us and then the waiter rushed right past us. It took 20 minutes to get service, so I asked to speak to the manager and she berated us! I was really shocked. We said we were going to leave, even though by then the appetizers were just being delivered, and she snatched away the appetizers!So we went up the street to La Mediterranee and it was delicious (though it took a while to get food, so we were pretty hungry by then.)

A Review of the Tasting Menu at Dosa:Abby and I live down the street and decided to choose Dosa as the site for a special celebration dinner. Seeing as it was a special occasion we opted for the four course tasting with accompanying wines.While the tasting was fun and allows for a lot of freedom in choice (each person can order different items and wines), nothing that came out really lived up to the price tag, and as a whole, when I picture all four courses together they just don&#39;t equal what we paid for them in their quality, presentation, or originality.The dosa was great, but was not enough to carry the meal. Plus, you can get the same dosa on their lunch menu (exact same dish) for pennies on the dollar. This was my main problem with Dosa&#39;s tasting menu, it wasn&#39;t anything special, it was just more money. Step it up!The other dishes, a curry, some shrimp, two bland desserts, were ok, but not the kind of thing the price brings you to expect. Another fault was the seating, when you make a dinner reservation and are enjoying a four course meal you (or at least I) expect a table in the restaurant, but to my surprise we were seated in the bar, which might be great for sharing a few appetizers but is quite unsuitable for an actual dinner.At the e end of the day the dinner for two consisting of four courses and matching wines (no dessert wine though? WTF!) put us back about $200. Its not that this is a crazy amount to pay for a meal, but in San Francisco there are just too many other great establishments that do a much better job for much less. A fact that makes it hard to stomach paying out such cash for a few tender tandori shrimp and micro greens.That all said the food is good, and if you go at lunch or brunch you can get the same food we paid top dollar for at a much more fitting cost. And seeing as they make a delicious curry bloody-merry I am sure I will find my way back at some point, just not for dinner.

Not impressed. I had heard great things about Dosa and I came here for Dine About Town lunch and while I had a good experience here the food was only mediocre. The service was excellent, our waitress was super attentive and helpful.For $18 we were given a selection of 3 starters and 3 entrees to choose from. I chose the beet soup, my friend the chickpeas salad, and the boys the chicken dish which they all enjoyed. I&#39;d say the beet soup was the highlight of my meal, it was a sweet pure of beet topped with creme fraiche, perfect. For my entree I ordered the restaurant namesake, a chutney-mint dosa. The dosa was bigger than the plate it was served on a filled with potato and mint, a soup and 2 dipping sauces accompanied the dish. I wasn&#39;t so impressed, but maybe it was because I was expecting something totally different. I thought the dosa would be hot and crispy but it was mushy and limp.Perhaps the DAT menu didn&#39;t showcase the restaurants all star dishes, I&#39;ll have to try it again.

1. Make a reservation.Ok, this place was great! It is total class right down to the mammoth chandeliers. It is somewhat restaurant/club with the swank attire of the patrons, the decor, and the club music. The food was extremely vegetarian friendly and nondairy. We did have to pay a $25 corkage fee, but it was worth it for having a bottle we knew that we would enjoy.I wish they had a location in Chicago, but this is the best Indian food that I&#39;ve had in a long time. Highly recommend.

Went here last night with a couple of friends. For a sunday, it was really busy, but then again, Michael Bauer&#39;s review did just come out in the paper giving the place an overall of 2.5 stars.The space is fantastic. Great vibe, cool bar area and I love the concept behind the communal table. Only drawback is that at most places with communal seating, it serves as a first come, first serve type of deal, however at Dosa, it is used for reservations.We started at the bar with a drink, as we arrived a little earlier than our reservation time. The drinks were nice and refreshing, really light, but not very strong. We didn&#39;t have to wait long to be seated.Being our first time at Dosa and not really knowing what to expect, or to order for that matter, we decided on the tasting menu with the wine pairings. We all got something different, so with the three of us, we were able to taste a good amount of the food.Starters were good. We opted for the mung beans, crab cake and chicken. Crab cake was all crab and it came with this habanero chutney that is amazing. I absolutely love spicy food and it was soooooo good. It was so good, that I asked for a side of it (which they ended up charging me for, and took away from me in the middle of the meal as they were clearing, so that was a little disappointing).Next were the dosas and my friends and I have never had them before. We didn&#39;t really know what to expect, we tried 3 different ones and my favorite of the three was the Spring dosa. It was crisp on the outside and the veggies were really good. The different chutneys were good, however I didn&#39;t really care for the coconut chutney.For our third course we had the lamb, fish and chicken curries. The Lamb was the best of the three, but the fish was really moist and literally melted in your mouth. The lemon basmati rice is delicious.As for the wine pairings with each course, I probably wouldn&#39;t do it again. I would have rather gotten a bottle of a dry sweet wine for the first two courses and then perhaps move onto a red, but you could drink a white for the whole meal, since most of the meal is has a lot of spice.We ended with the three different desserts on the tasting menu and the best was the chocolate sorbet. The fried milk dough ball was a little too sweet and sits in syrup. On the menu it states that you get two balls, but we only got one. The rasmalai cheese dessert was not suited to my taste but you can&#39;t beat chocolate, so that&#39;s what I liked.Overall the meal was good. Service was good, our server knew the menu and food well. We enjoyed ourselves on a rainy sunday evening and I will definitely find myself there again. I&#39;m interested to know what lunch is like, since the menu is a bit different.

Definitely one of the best Indian restaurant I have been to in the bay area (and you can take my word for it as I know my Indian food real good).The restaurant is pretty upscale and pricey but totally worth the money. The food is very tasty and pretty authentic. I wasn&#39;t expecting such good food from a pricey upscale restaurant but I was extremely impressed. I tried the Manglorean prawn curry with coconut rice and should say I give it a full 5/5.

It is crazy to think that this swanky space used to be the grungy Goodwill. It&#39;s gorgeous! Just think NOPA gone sexy.We popped in here to salvage a girl&#39;s movie night that had been disappointing (note: you can wait to rent He&#39;s Just Not That Into You) and Dosa left us on a high note. We walked in and were seated in under 5 minutes. I had a delicious vodka cocktail called Bollywood Hills that had a distinctly Indian Spice to it. Be warned, it packs a punch!Once we were seated we ordered a bottle of champagne, and I had a potato dosa. I thought it was a single person serving, but it would feed at least 2! The flavor was impeccable, and all three dipping sauces it was served with offered a fantastic variety.I can&#39;t wait to go back for a full meal!

$5 cocktails and snacks at happy hour? why haven&#39;t i been coming here more? they do one special cocktail for the happy hour price, last week&#39;s was amazing: bourbon, maple syrup, mint and muddled blood orange. i coulda drank those honies all night.about 8 of us gathered here for bookclub. since we had just read shantaram we felt indian food was in order. (side note: read shantaram--it&#39;s amazing).i&#39;ve eaten at dosa probably 3 or 4 times now and never gotten around to reviewing it. every time the food is good, but not spectacular. i&#39;m a big fan of the dosas. my favorite so far is the paneer and peas. it&#39;s kind of like a decadent indian burrito. i also loved the lamb meatballs, which are really succulent and nicely spicy. the pepper chicken dish i found a bit too salty, but others seemed to dig it. i&#39;m not huge into potatoes in my indian food, but if you are you&#39;ll find lots of them here. they&#39;re into the sustainable movement, so you&#39;re getting quality meats, veggies and homemade yogurt which i can totally get behind.i have to say it&#39;s the setting that&#39;s really spectacular. it&#39;s such a gorgeous swanky-chic restaurant. i love those giant light fixtures that dangle from the ceiling like jellyfish. they make what could be a cavernous space really feel intimate and that soft lighting is helping everyone. it&#39;s a good place to get a little dressed for, altho i wouldn&#39;t call it a special occasion restaurant, more just city fabulous.more happy hours here are definitely in order.

I get asked occasionally for Indian restaurant recommendations, but am no help. For one thing, I don&#39;t see how anything can possibility beat my mom&#39;s macher jhol and my mashi&#39;s moog dal; for another, most of the Indian places around here are heavy on the North Indian cuisine (tandoori, creamy sauced curries, etc), which I avoid if possible.My first and best memory of South Indian food was in Visag; the RKM guesthouse food was simple, but so fresh and flavorful that I&#39;ve never forgotten it. I&#39;ve tried the Udupi Palace locations in Berkeley and SF, as well as the Dosa on Valencia, but nothing matched up; my hard-to-please dad and forgiving-mom both said the Dosa on Valencia was okay, but didn&#39;t come close to this little Calcutta hole-in-the-wall where they used to go on dates. Yeah, right, because being in love had nothing to do with their happy memories!Anyway, back to the review: I&#39;ll be glad to recommend Dosa on Fillmore to anyone who asks! The meal was consistently good; we liked every single dish and enjoyed all the different flavors.Items sampled:Bengali gimlet cocktailBollywood hills cocktailLeek soupRasamSamosasEggplant dosaPaneer dosaMung dosaTamil veg curryPistachio gelatoMy friend and I were unsure about the curry-flavored nectar in the gimlet, so the bartender let us have a taste. It was sweet and spicy and totally tasty, so I decided to get the gimlet. Actually, I started drinking my friend&#39;s bollywood hills cocktail by mistake, and then when I switched to the right drink, I couldn&#39;t really tell the difference. Most of that is due to inexperience -- I apparently can&#39;t differentiate between gin and vodka, hello -- but the overwhelming flavor I remember from both was lime juice. Which is delicious, particularly kaffir lime, but I wish the curried nectar was stronger in the gimlet.The leek soup was creamy and delicious; the rasam was fiery and cleared up my friend&#39;s sinuses (I tasted it and was glad it wasn&#39;t too strong with the tamarind). The samosas were ehhh, good enough, but the two chutneys (tamarind and cilantro) were brilliant.All the dosas were really tasty, although the eggplant seemed a little overwhelmed by potato. I enjoyed the presentation; the eggplant was a triangle, the paneer was shaped like eggrolls, and the mung was a traditional cylinder. Getting to eat with my hands and alternating with the tomato and the coconut (my personal favorite) chutneys ... so good.Since it was my birthday, I said yes to the pistachio gelato. I don&#39;t really like kulfi, because of the problem with ice crystals, but the creamy gelato texture and rich pistachio flavor? Utter bliss. I thought about getting the rice pudding, because of the birthday &#34;payesh&#34; tradition, but I&#39;m so glad I went with the gelato. If I had to pick a favorite part of the meal, this would be it.Don&#39;t get me wrong, the whole meal was generally very strong. I wish I saw the final bill (my friends hid it), but I think it was about $140 for 4 people (including 3 drinks, tax, tip). So this qualifies as a once-in-a-while treat. I&#39;m glad for the owner&#39;s sake that Dosa is so popular; however, I&#39;m thankful that we went on a low-key Monday evening and missed the suffocating bustle of the hip and trendy. Anyway, I&#39;ll definitely come back, and bring my parents too. I wonder what they&#39;ll make of the Bengali gimlet.

A lot like Dosa on Valencia, but with fancy decor, more noise, andmore people. Meh.To be fair, the decor is great, but... &#39;s a bit over the top for Dosa. Not a fan of the service, either. I prefer the Valencia version, preferably off-peak.

The last time I was in the Dosa building it was a Goodwill (now across the street), so it was a bit of a shock to see it so completely transformed. It&#39;s funny to think that I used to try on clothes where the kitchen is now located. The current space is beautiful, with gorgeous lighting and atmosphere. The obvious money that went into it seems to be worth it, because even late on a weekday evening it was so crowded that we had to sit at the communal table in order to avoid a 20-minute wait.Having been to the Valencia location, I thought I knew what to expect food-wise. Maybe I ordered the right dishes this time, but it was much better than I remembered. I had the masala uttapam and my boyfriend had the spicy lentil dosa, and they were both excellent, with just the right amount of spice. Plus, the prices were more reasonable than I had remembered. Overall, a winner.

So its 09 now. Time to get cracking on the resolutions.1. Lose 30 lbs this year.2. Save a bunch of $$$.3. Do more community service.4. Get to REALLY know your friends.Well Dosa won&#39;t help me w/ most of those, but at least I know where to go in case I feel like cheating. ;)So I&#39;m here to kick it w/ the wonderful Linda T, who is visiting from So Cal. I have never had south Indian food, so I didn&#39;t know what to expect.First impression. &#34;Wow, this place is posh.&#34; Brand spanking new everything. Clean as a whistle. Huge interior w/ high ceilings.The place was full of people, but it didn&#39;t see too cramped for me; nobody looming over the table, nobody giving the evil eye when we were chatting over dinner, no waitress taking plates off our table prematurely. This was a plus.So I decide on having the Paneer and Peas Uttapam (sorta hard to describe, but it tasted like a potato pancake w/ farmer&#39;s cheese and peas. Served w/ some great sauces. It was light and tasty. The sauces were each very different. The white sauce was sweet w/ a slight coconut milk taste, the orange sauce was more tangy w/ a taste of curry. The soup-like sauce was well....soupy *Dam, I should have taken notes*. Despite it being completely vegetarian, it didn&#39;t lack in flavor at all. I was completely full after the meal.I wouldn&#39;t say it&#39;s a cheap place, but w/ the fresh ingredients, the time and care spent in cooking the food, the ambiance, the space, the light friendly atmosphere...you are definitely getting what you pay for. Now if only I can find a date to take here.....

Meeting up with my high school best friend after being away in HK for 5 months and getting totally spoiled by this renowned culinary capital of Asia...It was lunch time and we&#39;re gonna watch Moonrise Kingdom at Kabuki theatre, so she suggested Dosa right across the street.It was a little past noon and the place was already half full. I was still full from my late breakfast, so I just ordered an appetizer: Watermelon, Paneer and Mung Sprout Salad. My friend ordered the mini mustard green dosa.Here&#39;s what made my experience not so great: I requested to have my salad without the coconut and the waiter said &#34;OK!&#34;. Then the salad came with the coconut. I wanted to complain but everyone seemed really busy, whatever...it&#39;s just a small salad.My friend really liked her mini dosa though, and I may go back again to try that (that&#39;s what you&#39;re supposed to have when you go to a restaurant named &#34;Dosa&#34;...)The dessert was very very interesting. It was made of vermicelli, raisons, spices in a pool of milky sweet coconut &#39;soup&#39;. Again, I don&#39;t like coconut...so I&#39;m probably not the best judge. I took a few bites and left the rest to my friend.Good thing that I wasn&#39;t hungry..but I&#39;m sure that my next trip here will be better, unless the waiter messes up my order again.

I went to Dosa for brunch and had a good experience. The decor is really amazing and I would imagine it is a great spot to go for late night cocktails or dinner. Brunch was just ok. There are only two items on the brunch menu that have meat in them which was a little disappointing. However, if you are a vegetarian this is the perfect spot for you. Prices are very reasonable and the service was ok. I had the chopped salad which was awesome and some sort of pancakey dish which was good. I would like to go back for dinner before forming a final opinion. But I think it will still stand with a solid 4 star rating.Overall, it&#39;s a beautiful atmosphere, prices are good and it&#39;s right across the street from Kabuki. Definitely go into the bathroom because the choice of tile is really amazing. Be careful with the hand dryer. It&#39;s so powerful it just might rip your fingers off.

I have been neglecting my Yelp duties for the past few weeks, but with good reason I promise. My company went out of business and I have joined the ranks of the fastly growing unemployed. I recognize this should leave me plenty of time to be Yelping my brains out, however I found it depressing to sit back and review the amazing restaurants and bars that I will be taking hiatus from in my time of poverty. Sigh...The good part about being unemployed is that people feel bad for you and want to do things to try and &#34;help.&#34; For my friends this means either getting me good and drunk or fed...or both. A few nights ago, my best friend Billy told me he was going to succeed at getting me tossed and full of delicious food. I happily and eagerly agreed. In the cab over, I casually asked what type of cuisine we would be enjoying that evening. Japanese? Mexican? Thai? Persian? Any of these would rock my world. Billy simply responded with &#34;You&#39;ll see.&#34;We pulled into Japantown and my mouth began to water with thoughts of grilled seabass and salmon sashimi, but the minute Billy held the door open to a place called &#34;Dosa&#34; my expression dropped.I should probably tell you now that I generally loathe Indian food. This isn&#39;t just a disliking of the cuisine, it is a profound hatred. For whatever reason, it turns my stomach...normally. It is here that I humbly admit I may have turned a corner in my battle with Indian food.Billy ushered me straight to the bar and proceeded to pour bottles of wine and martini glasses brim full of Manhatten&#39;s and other delicious inebriations down my throat. He&#39;s a smart boy and knew that the only way he would survive this dinner was to start by getting me good and plowed. The bar scene is over the top Hollywood-esque. I love the energy and artwork in this restaurant. It&#39;s very visually stimulating.Finally our reservation was called and we moved to the table. The waitress introduced herself and was extremely friendly. I proceeded to embarass Billy by grabbing her sleeve and asking her assistance in ordering as &#34;I can&#39;t stand Indian food.&#34; Rather than turning up her nose at me, she smiled, laughed and told me she hears this multiple times a day. She quizzed me on things I like and don&#39;t like and took the menu from my hand. &#34;I&#39;ll take care of you honey.&#34;To start, samosas with some sort of sweet and tangy sauce that I loved. Along side, she had ordered me a salad with mango and nuts. If it isn&#39;t authentic, I don&#39;t care...I ate every last fork full. Then came what they are famous for which is the &#34;Dosa.&#34; To me it looked like a giant empanada with three sorts of dips alongside (forgive me, half my extended family is from Argentina). One of the dosas that came out the waitress warned me was &#34;waaaaay spicy&#34; and contained habaneros and mango. Again, probably not authentic but I was down for the challenge as I love spicy food. I popped a bite in my mouth, and it definately came with a kick but nothing painful.Overall I had an excellent night at Dosa and appreciate Billy for basically trapping me into trying it out. Perhaps I have changed my mind about Indian cuisine....either that or I have mastered ordering the most non-traditional items on the menu to keep me happy.Bonus points for being across the street from the Kabuki theater...my fave.

So...I&#39;ve eaten here at least a dozen times since my initial assessment. Everything has tightened up. The bar has gotten faster. The waitstaff is having fun and is sure of what they&#39;re doing. The menu is still terrific. No downside other than it&#39;s getting pretty crowded. Time your dining and drinking around a movie at the Sundance Kabuki and you have a great night out.5 stars.

This is a fun, trendy place to get a great cocktail, catch up with friends and eat a delicious dosa. The space is beautiful - high ceilings, sleek decor, not too loud, not too quiet. They do a great job explaining the menu and making recommendations. The food is a good introduction to newbies and certainly good enough for the seasoned palate who wants to spice it up. Great variety and they also have a decent prix-fixe menu if you&#39;re up for 4 courses.

I&#39;m just going to confess right up front that I&#39;m one of those freaks of nature that doesn&#39;t like cilantro. And, I know, Indian food is not the best choice for someone like me. I get it! But I manage to eat lots of Indian food all over the city, and would go so far as to say that Indian is my comfort food. I could seriously eat it every day of the week.My main problem with Dosa was that the food was only &#34;eh,&#34; and we had been expecting &#34;POW!&#34; My friend and I each ordered the tasting menu with wine pairings, and then swapped everything back and forth. I didn&#39;t, you know, spit anything into my napkin. But I didn&#39;t want to fight his fingers back with my fork so that I could hoard something especially tasty for myself either. And several things I pushed aside after just a bite or two. (My friend, who is far less picky than me, was similarly underwhelmed.)My picky issue comes back to the cilantro thing. The one item on the menu that I was dying to try was the pea/paneer dosa. I asked our server immediately if it had cilantro, or could be made without cilantro. I was told yes, and no. So I ordered a variety of other things -- many of which came out covered in cilantro, as if they had put extra cilantro on just for me. I was supremely annoyed that the server didn&#39;t warn me, especially after I had already asked for a dish to be made without it. How hard would it have been to say, &#34;I hate to break it to you, but our kitchen is very cilantro centric, and we can&#39;t customize dishes&#34;? At the very least I would have expected her to ask the kitchen to exclude the cilantro GARNISHES, which were obviously added right before the plates left the kitchen.Needless to say, we won&#39;t be headed back anytime soon. I was hoping to find a new favorite rainy day, pick-me-up restaurant, and got several mouthfuls of dreaded cilantro instead. Yuck.

Having just bought the tickets for &#34;Slumdog Millionaire&#34;, we stepped outside the Kabuki theater to head towards our favorite pre-movie dinner spot. That&#39;s when I noticed &#34;Dosa&#34;, right across the street and on the corner.Having had mixed reviews of the first location, best described as &#34;having a heart of gold but sometimes walking with two left feet&#34;, we decided there was no better time to take that long overdue second chance, than at the second location.Here, the lights are dimmer, the ceilings higher, and everything is just so plush in hues of dark brown, gold, and warm orange. Huge icicle-like chandeliers hang from the ceiling in a multitude of tiny lights. Intricately designed metal carvings create texture along the walls. This is definitely a spot to see or be seen in. Elegant and trendy but in a good way.Tables are crammed up near each other so conversation can be a little difficult. Staff orchestrate themselves well across the narrow isles, making sure to tap their co-workers on the shoulder or back as they pass to avoid accidental knocks and spills. They were courteous and had a pretty good hand at knowing their wine selection and describing the dishes. Servers still needed a little nudge before they remembered to explain each uttapam that came in the &#34;South Indian Moons&#34; (chef&#39;s selection of 5), because god knows I can&#39;t deduce from plain sight, and the menu was taken away a long time ago.AND YES, YES, FINALLY THE FOOD... The food is self-described by website as &#34;Southern Indian&#34; with emphasis in dosas (like flat wheat-like crepes, lightly crisp, stuffed and rolled with a variety of fillings like paneer and spiced lentils) and uttapams (slightly thicker and smaller than dosas where ingredients are cooked right into the batter). These selections average $10 in price and come with a side of tomato chutney, coconut chutney (heavenly), and sambar (spicy liquidly lentil-flavored mixture).Basically if you&#39;re looking to drown yourself in thick curries, they have some on the menu, but the whole point is to expand beyond that and enjoy the adventure that ensues. Bring friends and order family-style, this food is best when passed around and shared.Looking back on our experience, we may have to change our pre-movie dining habits now...because this place is simply awesome.

DOSA stands for Delicious Outstanding Superb AmazingI had never eaten South Indian Cuisine before and I was absolutely thrilled with everything I tasted. The samosas were just spicy enough, and the dips were delicious. I had a basic dosa, the masala, and it was huge! I ate the whole thing though.....I loved my diet coke, it was a little bottle of something that wasn&#39;t a name brand, just loved it! The ambiance is really nice, I was with some girlfriends and we could talk and laugh without worrying about other people listening or getting upset that we may have been too loud.I like the fact that a lot of the food on the menu is vegetarian. I&#39;m always on the lookout for good vegetarian places, I do eat meat but it can be so easy to cut it out too. YUMMY

Hands down great south indian food. Taste very close to authentic, this is coming from Indian with very flavorful palette. They have variety of twist (pumpkin, paneer, basil, etc) on typical dosa recipe. Vibrant ambiance, loud but fun for a night out. They have a upper level which is quieter. I recommend to make reservations.

OK, there are qualifications to my review. 1) the food was good 2) service was good except for one absolutely huge failure (see below) 3) I will return to see if they can increase their rating.Reason for the bad rating:1) Everything was fine until the near end of our meal, 10, 15, 20, 30 minutes went by until we realized our server had gone home for the night without giving us our check, or even saying anything to us at all. We had to knock over (and I really do mean knock over) another server to get a bill and then have them pick the bill up. When we spoke to the management about our &#34;abandonment issues&#34;, they basically started to give us excuses (&#34;oh we were really busy tonight&#34;), wrapped in apologies. We paid out check and walked out in a huff.2) The 20% mandatory tip on parties of 5 or more. Listen, I can buy 18% on parties of 8 and even 6...but this is just getting greedy isn&#39;t it? Dosa - Let me decide how much over the standard 15% I want to tip (generally give 18%) and on parties of just 5! This will for sure keep me away.All that said, love the space! :)

Dahi Vada dumplins, Chutney Dosa with eggplant, Channa Bhatura (fried wheat bread with garbanzo bean dip).Drink recommendation... Juhu Palm -- made with gin, coconut milk &amp; other fun flavors, this drinks is sweet with a touch of spice.

Dined here with 8 colleagues recently (may-2012). Reservations are necessary for a larger parties. For this big a group they have space on their second floor. Menu is filled with South Indian dishes with a choice of rice or dosa or uthappam. Among the eight of us, we ordered a variety of dishes, such as lamb, chicken and duck. Although the preparations were great (and very spicy), I was not thrilled at all by the presentation of any one of our dishes. Food was extremely spicy, and little appalling to us was that our server did not tell us about the spice level or did not give us a choice to decide. Rice that came with the dishes was great testing. In all, for the non-Indians among us, the food spice level was little troubling.Cocktails at this place was out of this world: we ordered Moksha and Divya: without knowing much about them from the names. But both turned out to be too good. They were truly work of arts.In short, I would return to the place to try out other dishes, but not truly impressed by the hype, and the cost is not justified unless it&#39;s a corporate dinner. And, to be frank, if you want to impress your corporate guests, you would be better off having cocktails here and dining at Amber India on 4th/Market st.

The ambiance is upscale, but it&#39;s still casual, and they have wonderful art on the wall and lighting.For food, first make sure to order one of their delicious cocktails and then dig heartily into their four course tasting menu or I highly recommend any of the following:- Mung sprout salad- Chennai Chicken- Prawn Chile Fry- South Indian Samosa &amp; Potatoes Peas Croquette- South Indian Bhel Puri- Idli Sambar- Channa Bhatura- Kerala Fish Moilee- South Indian Lamb Kofta- Masala Dosa (but you really can&#39;t go wrong with any of the dosas)- Poori and a healthy side of raita on the side

We were given a window table facing outside,but turned ourselves around because the view is far better looking in.Went in for brunch, and loved the whole experience. Food was great--all the flavors were amazing--and the staff was super friendly and nice. Only bad part was paying the check at the end. :)

I can only rate based on a single cocktail after a movie at the Kabuki - and that cocktail was deliciousiousness served Up.Not to mention the space is gorgeous.The food being brought to the tables looked tasty - next time we&#39;ll try it, or maybe we&#39;ll have another cocktail.

As Dosa on Valencia&#39;s biggest fan and frequent stalker, I have been anxiously awaiting it&#39;s sister location on Fillmore. I heard it was going to be BIG, that it was designed with all energy-efficient and recycled materials, and that they would have new dishes and a FULL BAR. Even knowing this and that the owners Emily and Anjan wouldn&#39;t do anything unless they could do it well, I was awed by the results of their efforts at the new Dosa.I was first struck by the amber lighting, cast by different, beautiful chandeliers hanging at various heights from the tall ceiling. Take the time to absorb the powerful photography, made even more so for us as we learned that same day of the terrorist attacks in Mumbai.As enchanting as the decor is, I go to Dosa for the unequalled South Indian food, so I would have sat right on the floor of the old Goodwill at this location and enjoyed the coconut and red bell pepper soup, cauliflower dosa, and (I couldn&#39;t resist my old favorite) rich lamb curry and enjoyed it just as much. The new halibut dish was also perfectly spiced and will be on my must-order list. You will be pleased to know that the prices remain very reasonable.Don&#39;t miss the signature cocktails--the creamy, not-too-sweet Juhu Palm being my favorite so far. You can&#39;t get fresher ingredients than these. Being winos, the hubba hubba hubs and I also had to try every new red and white on the list (and you wonder why you couldn&#39;t shake your hangover the next day, my green-eyed boy?), which were all stellar accompaniments to the food. The bar manager and wine connoisseur Jonny did a superb job!All of the servers, reflective of Emily and Anjan themselves, are warm, gracious, and extremely knowledgeable. Our server was clearly honored and excited to be working there. As frequent diners know, this makes a the difference between a meal and a memorable night out.So if you need to get ahold of me, just look on Valencia or Fillmore, where I will be dividing my stalking time between the two Dosas!

Nice lighting fixtures. Ugly ceilings. The rest of the interior is pretty nice and comfy.The staff still needs to come together, nothing unexpected with a fairly new place. The hostess needs to learn to pick up her feet and stop shuffling. Major annoyance, hearing her slump around all night.The food is good. The blackened sardines are excessively delightful, try them.The fried onion appetizer was only so-so, but the lamb curry is delicious.The cocktail list (understandably so) is very heavy on the gin, which this vodka girl doesn&#39;t like, but at least they are interesting concoctions.All in all: yummy yum yum.

The new space is pretty sweet, although a little overwhelming - I think I prefer the Valencia Dosa a tad better for a more intimate atmosphere, although the decor is impressive with lots of natural light pouring in.Came here for lunch and split the following:Pani Puri - fun to assemble and eat, but probably wouldn&#39;t repeatCoconut soup - outstanding. Insane flavors and creamy delicious texture. Overall the best dish of the meal.Paneer &amp; Romaine salad - tasty farmer&#39;s cheese, light &amp; fresh.Spring Dosa - great dipping sauces, not too heavy, rich flavors.Between 2 of us both with decent appetites, this was plenty of food! Portion sizes were bigger than I expected. Service was pretty slow especially for a casual mid-day lunch, but hopefully this will improve as they get the hang of the bigger space.

Pretty freaking good. Would I go back? Yes...but likely only1) for a dinner w/ out of town guests2) for a celebratory dinner3) when craving fancy indian food4) when too lazy to travel more than 100 feet after a movie at the Kabuki5) when I need to feel cool again ;)I believe this space was a Goodwill shop prior to being a glitzy, hip ameri-indian restaurant and bar. I&#39;ve passed the Mission Dosa many times but never had the urge to explore the supposedly overly-American Indian food. But after catching my eye with the uber-cool spot on Fillmore, I couldn&#39;t resist. We indulged in a post Slumdog Millionaire dinner there and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves (No, the Indian themed night was not planned.)Loved the...- Channa Bhatura Chick pea (garbanzo) masala w/ bhatura (oversized, soft, puffy wheat bread - reminded me of a cross between naan and roti)- Tamil lamb curryEnjoyed but would try something else next time...- Spring dosa- Calamari- ParathaGreat cocktails and corkage for $25.Try this new spot for your next dinner date, dinner w/ friends or out of town guests. You&#39;ll feel satisfied and too cool for school.

I&#39;d been waiting to try the new location for a while to avoid the crowd a new fabulous place always attracts. We finally braved the crowd and had a wonderful experience, the new location is much more spacious and holds a big crowd well, we were seated immediately (it was a monday night). The decor was lovely, elegant yet not too over the top.The service was excellent, I was with my sister who doesn&#39;t tolerate dairy or onions very well and the staff took special care to accommodate her needs. Most of the menu items are chock full of onions and they patiently walked us through the menu to find something that would work, they even sent a sample of something up from the kitchen to see if she liked it. How&#39;s that for service!I&#39;ve travelled to Southern India twice in the last three years and it&#39;s my favorite region of India, the food being one of the reasons why. Dosa captures the essence of South Indian food perfectly, I loved every bite. I can&#39;t wait to go back again!

This is a lovely establishment. However, I found the wait staff and one of the bartenders to be bland...not wanting to make suggestions, awkward smirks. It just didn&#39;t seem like they enjoyed their jobs.Anyway, the drinks were a little too ambitious and had a lot of traditional Indian spices added to them. The food was good, but one word of warning, if you don&#39;t like, &#34;make you sweat&#34; spicy, you&#39;re going to need to tell them that when you order.So the reason I&#39;m giving 3 stars is because I came here with friends to celebrate my b-day and one of my friends brought me a cake. We&#39;ve all heard of a corking fee, but have you heard of a $3 a plate cake fee? Our waiter wanted us to give him $3 each so he could serve us my cake!!

oh yes. Dosa has done it right this time. i stopped in for dinner Friday evening after going to see &#39;Milk&#39; with a friend at the Kabuki just across the street. what a nice surprise to find out we were there on opening night! and it was busy. already! they didn&#39;t even need to have the sign up yet outside. not to mention it was a holiday weekend with lots of usual city-dwellers MIA.i&#39;ve been a fan of the Mission location since they opened (and a fan of south Indian food in general after spending a summer in the south of India). but frankly...they have outgrown that space. over the few years Dosa has been opened, it has become quite popular. for good reason: fresh unique south (and a bit of north) indian-style dishes with a fancy flair. something that was badly needed in San Francisco.as far as the new locale: i fell in love with the space upon entering. (i think it used to be the goodwill which now sits caddy corner?) high ceilings, gorgeous hanging chandeliers, perfectly dimly lit, a paint palette and walls of art that suit the vibe and cuisine...and of course the alluring smell of the food. this location seats 130-some odd guests, between the main floor, balcony and large communal table in the bar area. and of course then there a full bar and the menu has a nice list of some India-inspired cocktails as well as a good wine list.the menu appeared basically the same, therefore i had a hard time steering away from my favorite Dosa dishes (like the Cochin calamari). but we did try the paper Masala Dosa as well as the five moons Uttapam which were both AMAZING. i cannot say enough good things...congratulations and THANK YOU Dosa.

Dosa on Fillmore is such a fantastic addition to the neighborhood! I came here for the first time to mach up with a friend for lunch and I immediately fell in love with the decor. Picture modern, eclectic Indian-inspired touches with ornate, feather and glitter-infused chandeliers hanging from their 30-foot tall ceilings. [Inner voice says, &#34;Whoa, I could live here.&#34;]As for the food and drink, yeeeeeeuhm yum yum!! We shared a traditional South Indian dish as a starter - they were the equivalent of bite-sized yogurt-filled cream puffs, which taste-wise resembled 7-layer dip [a good thing!]. We also had the vegetable curry and the Paper Masala Dosa - both were supremely flavorful and beautifully plated.I&#39;m sincerely impressed! I was really pleased at the end of the meal, for while I definitely got my fill of food, I didn&#39;t leave feeling stuffed or heavy. Dosa is definitely Indian food with a lighter side. I can&#39;t wait to come back!

I would give Dosa a 3.5 on food quality and my overall experience - but because I think it&#39;s overpriced, I&#39;m choosing a 3 instead of a 4 as 3.5 isn&#39;t an option (Yelp should really change that anyways.)I really love Indian food, so I was super excited to try Dosa. I had heard great things about it. I also heard that their drinks were amazing, and I love a good cocktail, so once again, I was really looking forward to the meal. Maybe it is because I had such high expectations for Dosa - but I wasn&#39;t really blown away. I&#39;ve eaten a lot of Indian food, and Dosa is good, no doubt about that, but it isn&#39;t really great.First, I ordered a cocktail (I can&#39;t remember the name - sorry), but it was one of the ones that was spicy. I don&#39;t know why I thought I would like this, but I just don&#39;t like spicy cocktails. Especially when Indian food is spicy - then the spicy cocktail doesn&#39;t quench your thirst. To be honest, I didn&#39;t even finish my drink, and THAT is crazy for me. On top, my friend didn&#39;t like the drink either.For dinner, my friend and I decided to split everything. For our appetizer, we ordered Chennai chicken and the scallops - and both were pretty good, the scallops were my favorite part of the meal, but I just love scallops. I would definitely recommend them!For our main course, we ordered the prawn massala and the regular dosa. The prawn massala was good, but I&#39;m still debating whether it was worth the price. Maybe I just don&#39;t like Dosas (then I guess it was a mistake going to a restaurant named after them), but I was unimpressed by the Dosa we ordered. Sure, it wasn&#39;t bad, but my goal of restauranting isn&#39;t to leave saying &#34;not bad&#34; - I should be in awe of their culinary skills.I would go back to Dosa, but I wouldn&#39;t actually have a Dosa. Their menu looks really good, so I would order to scallops again, and try a different main course.. and order a different drink. I&#39;m not giving up yet.

Goodwill = Good restaurant and Good food! Hard to believe this lovely space is the old Goodwill. I&#39;ve been wanting to try Dosa for a while and was really excited when they opened on Fillmore, like Delfina, much more convenient for me,.I had never had southern Indian or so I thought but recognized some standbys for me including benghan bharta - one of my absolute favorites and their version had chicken. We tried a couple actual &#39;Dosa&#39;s&#39; and really liked the pea and paneer one!We sat at one of the bar tables and there was a strange period of service between, 4:30 and 5:30p before they start serving food but once we hit 5:30p and could order food, we had great service!

Go for the food, never go back because of the service! The food being absolutely fabulous, both well spiced and elegantly cooked is the only reason they got even 2 stars. I went about 2/3&#39;s of my meal without anything to drink because they seemed totally averse to refilling my water or iced tea, despite my asking everyone one of the many people that seemed to keep checking up on our table.

Been to both Dosa but went to this one for lunch and had a birthday cocktail. Man, I don&#39;t remember what is was but it was good. Food is good and you can get combo, a little bit of this a little bit of that, but that cocktail is what sticks in my mind. Maybe it was the fact that I got to have some booze during the middle of a work day but as I&#39;m writing this all I can think of is how good that cocktail was.Nice cool decor, good service (our waitress was really helpful with selecting the right items) and tasty cocktails.

I tend to be in this area a lot, whether it&#39;s for a show at the Fillmore or a flick at Sundance Kabuki. Despite being surrounded dozens of Japanese restaurants, it seems I always end up at Dosa.Keep in mind that &#34;South Indian&#34; is not quite the same Indian food you&#39;re probably used to...but don&#39;t worry, its qualities and root flavors are similar.I usually start with a soup (all 3 are great and each is very different), then move on to a normal entree. Vegetarians have great options in the dosas and uttapams, which are essentially Indian crepes if you&#39;ve never eaten one.The place is a little overpriced, but the beautiful space inside might make up for that. Some might find the dimly-lit swankiness to be cheesy and uncharacteristic of San Francisco, but I find the atmosphere very appealing. Beautiful space with high ceilings, great place for a date.This is a slightly generous rating for an experience that is more like 3.5; the full bar -- something that seems less and less common these days -- pushed my rating to a 4.

I have never been to an Indian restaurant that has Duck and Calamari on the menu!Had Samosa, Dosa (Chutney Masala) &amp; Uttapam (South Indian Moons), which was good. For desert I had Toasted Coconut &amp; Saffron Barfi (grated coconut rolled in filo pastry, fried, served warm with mint &amp; Kiwi caramel), but I didn&#39;t like it at all.Overall, it is a trendy restaurant, and it was not the best Indian food I have had AND I did not get the feeling of eating &#34;Indian&#34;.

Fantastic!I&#39;ve never been to the Valencia restaurant, but can confirm that they&#39;ve done a great job on Fillmore. The space is gorgeous and inviting, and it was exciting to be in a San Francisco restaurant on a Tuesday night that was bustling after 9pm!The menu can be overwhelming for first-timers. I&#39;d recommend the tasting menu (at $39, it&#39;s not particularly cheap - but nothing at this restaurant is) for your first go. This will give you a good idea of the flavors and types of dishes DOSA serves - and it&#39;s a lot of food.Our waitress was very friendly, walking us through the menu and pointing out some of her favorite dishes. Our table didn&#39;t feel rushed at all. The same can be said for the hostess, who had no problem with a couple of us in our party arriving 10 minutes late for our reservation. No one seemed pretentious at all - perhaps some of the negative feedback along these lines from other Yelpers is being generated predominantly by the dreaded Thursday-Saturday nights? No excuse regardless, but again, I had no such experience.The bar is also really beautiful here, and their signature cocktails are quite interesting. I could imagine dropping in here just for drinks, and perhaps some dosas at the communal table.The only dull light for me was the dessert menu, which doesn&#39;t surprise me. The item on the menu that sounded like yummy doughnuts definitely was, um, not. But all in all, a great place, especially for those who have been there/done that and looking to try something different - particularly great for group dining.

Delicious, fresh and creative menu. I believe they roast some of their spices in-house, which makes for bright, rich flavors.Be sure to order at least one of the dosas. I like the classic Masala dosa, but if you want to make a statement, order the paper masala dosa. It is wafer thin, crispy soft and fun for sharing.The Fillmore branch is more formal, trendy and exotic while the Mission branch is a bit more casual and cozy. You can&#39;t go wrong with either one since their menus are nearly the same.

The great thing that really surprised me about this restaurant was their service. The host remembered who I was and called me from the bar after a 30 minute wait. The servers knew everything about the menu and I never had to ask for anything. Our cups were always filled with water and when my fork fell the floor someone grabbed it off the floor before I could and replaced it. Great Service!The food was great, curries were delicious, and dishes i had never tried before. The decor of the restaurant was really great and i remember seeing some awesome pictures from india up on the wall. I can&#39;t believe this space use to be the goodwill.

Before last night, I had only been to Dosa for brunch and had a great experience. My friend and I went to dinner and ordered off the sample menu - $39 for your choice of 4 dishes, or $59 with wine pairings - a great deal!We started off the night with two cocktails, of which there was a large list to choose from. I ordered the Silver Fizz (because I love drinks with egg whites) and it was light and refreshing. My friend got the South Indian crab cake appetizer, and I ordered the chili shrimp. Both were delicious and flavorful and plated very elegantly. A waitress (not ours) brought our first wine pairing and set it down on the table and walked away, until I stopped her to ask what the wines were. She said mine was a Torrontes, and wasn&#39;t sure what my friend&#39;s was. She came back a minute later and told him it was a Riesling. We both thought this was kind of weird, considering we paid an extra $20 for wine pairings.For our second course we shared a paneer &amp; peas dosa and the uttapam, both served with the same three delicious dipping sauces - a spicy orange sauce, a coconut-yogurt sauce, and a thick lentil sauce that could also be finished like a small cup of soup. We mixed the orange and coconut sauce on top of the dosa and it was perfect! For this course I had a Miner Sangiovese and my friend had an Iron Horse Chardonnay - both went very well with the dishes!I had the Lamb kofta for my third course, which was spicy and savory! It was paired with lemon basmati rice and raita. I just mixed it all together and devoured it. My friend ordered the prawn masala and he asked for it extra spicy. Considering it was one of the most mild dishes on the menu, the cooks hard a hard time ramping up the spice, but he admitted he should have ordered something more spicy to begin with. I forget what wines we had with the third course (probably because I was immersed in my lamb dish).We finished off the meal with some tangerine and coconut sorbet, which was the perfect pallet cleanser.Surprisingly, there aren&#39;t enough high-end Indian restaurants in San Francisco, and this is definitely one of the best! It&#39;s a great spot for a date, a group, or a night with a friend.

Girls and boys - let me just say, the hype is real.The restaurant itself is really nice. With soaring ceilings, intimate lighting (they dimmed the lights halfway through our meal!), multiple levels and floor to ceiling windows, you&#39;ll find the perfect level of sophistication without presumptuousness. Perfect for either a date or a catch up dinner between two friends =)Our waitress was very helpful in helping us decipher the menu and after a lot of puzzled reading and mispronouncing we decided to just opt for what she had recommended:-The &#34;bread&#34; was more like a cracker but with these crazy spices in it that made them taste amazing! As you chewed on it the flavor would completely change.-Samosas: Very traditional - we ordered it because my friend had never tried samosas before. They give you both a Northern India and Southern India samosa and it was fun to have them side by side to compare and discuss.-Paneer and Peas Dosa were highly recommended and we found it to be really delicious. For this one the paneer and peas were stuffed inside the dosa and we had three different sauces to try. Very good for the dosa novice =)-Kerala Fish Moilee: DELICIOUS. Also highly recommended and although it was the more expensive things on the menu we were lured by the thought of black cod. I would suggest that you give it a try! Not only is the fish amazing but the moilee (Kind of similar to curry? But totally different flavor and less texture) really enhanced the flavor. There is no way you can go wrong with black cod!!All in all a great experience and with the two of us splitting we ended up with a bill of $29 each (tip included). Totally reasonable! I will definitely be back as this is the new default restaurant I will be bringing my visiting friends. As a foodie I am always looking for new foods and flavors and am excited to explore everything that is offered on the menu at Dosa!!

We were able to get reservations and they helped us immediately. I can&#39;t believe this was formely a goodwill!!! The decor was really nice and I love the lighting.Tables were a little close together, but I&#39;m not clausterphobic and it gives you a friendly kind of feeling to it. Plus, you get to see what your neighbors are ordering and if it looks good..you can ask them about it!I did like the &#34;bread&#34; before you got your main dishes..but the suggestion of the waitress to get the Tamil Vegetable Curry was very disappointing!! I ordered per the recommendation with the Coconut Rice. The curry was salty, where I didn&#39;t eat much of it. I ate from my bfriend&#39;s dish instead which was the farmer&#39;s cheese dosa. Delicious. He also ordered the rice with yogurt. This takes some getting used to but it was really good. By the end of dinner, his dishes were gone and my dish that was recommended by the waitress was still sitting there.Our server was definitely not attentive nor the bussers. Our water was always dry and the waitress NEVER came back to check on us, until she brought the check!!! So i didn&#39;t even have a chance to comment on the saltiness of the curry!!!Would I come here again, probably just to give it one more chance. But I won&#39;t be ordering the Tamil Curry again. BLAH! And maybe next time, I&#39;ll have to wave the waitress down to complain.

The waiter was extremely helpful with explaining the process and translating the Dosa slang....i like....Chickpea curry + warm, soft, fluffy flatbread = delicious. I still dream about it. (sick, i know. there goes whats left of my fake online reputation)Calamari starter = sauteed, fresh, delicious, a touch citrus-y and healthy! Whats not to love?Have a nice Sav Blanc and enjoy a recession-savvy bill.

Dosa, Dosa, Dosa, what can I say about you. I am a bit torn about this place because I am not used to spending this much money on Indian food. You are paying for the decor, the nice electro-house-soulful music, the type of crowd that this place attracts, the service, etc. but still I am torn. It&#39;s not the most expensive restaurant on the block but let&#39;s put it in perspective. If you are in the mood to have a nice dinner, people watch, have good intellectual conversations, and have good indian food, go here. If you just want indian food and you have your nice conversation with good friends at home, then go to Shalimar.This is a nice date place. It&#39;s perfect for eating before a movie at the Sundance Cinemas or even to have a drink and snack afterwards. For two people, we spent almost 70 bucks with a glass of wine and beer. I would also recommend this place for first time indian food eaters. The waitress had no problem describing all the different options for dining as well as doling out recommendations for both food and drink.What we ordered for 4 people:Indian moon uttapomsome sort of dosachicken biryanilamb tindali??? some sort of lamb dish with lemon rice I can&#39;t rememberthe calamarisome crunchy dishchicken chennaiI had a hard time stopping myself from eating the food. If you aren&#39;t afraid of spices and bold flavors in an upscale setting go here now!PS I like this place better than Amber India hands down.

I&#39;ll try to keep this short:Food: Good qualityValue for price: OKAmbience: Chic (maybe too chic for Indian food)Menu selection: Standard to special (they have the basic masala dosa, along with unique, California style variations)The place is going for a very different vibe than most Indian restaurant; more of an Indian Bistro type feel. It reminded me of eating Indian food in 5star plus restaurants in India, where the food was definitely tailored for foreign visitors.The quality of the food (Masala Dosa and the Chutney Dosa) was excellent. Portion size was great. The Sambar, and the two chutneys served as sides were decent. However, as an aficionado of Indian food, you are definitely paying for the ambience and the feel, more than you are paying for the food.They offered an extensive wine list, and even have suggested wine pairings to go with the prix fix menu. However, I would always recommend Kingfisher beer with any Indian food.Decor was classy and elegant. They might play less samba and more Indian (or Indian-ish) music to give it more of an Indian feel (or not...)Overall, a good experience, but would definitley ONLY have the dosas there. Other appetizers and entrees seemed overpriced.

This was my second time to Dosa, and I have consistently recommended it since I first came here over a year ago.We began the dining adventure with a glass of Prosecco. A lovely way to toast the evening.For our dining delights, I will describe in further detail below. However, I am confident that everything you order will be enjoyed.Dahi Vada: The lentil dumplings are wonderful, but the yogurt and mint sauce are even better. You will want to soak up each but of the sauce with some bhatura.Channa Bhatura: The chickpeas were served whole and the sauce in which it was delivered was delicious. Sometimes I am not a chickpea fan but I was on this occasion. It has a nice bite to it.Spicy Andhra Prawns: They were spicy, and I do like spicy. I think though that they were a little overcooked. They come surrounded in a tomato based sauce and I feel as though the heat that they were immersed in, overcooked them.Paneer &amp; Peas: The dosa&#39;s are lovely, and they are consistent with their crepe preparation. I enjoyed the sauces that accompanied the dosa. Specifically the yogurt based one.Bhatura: Order it so that you can soak up all the sauces and dressings that accompany the dishes you order. It is also comical to watch you diners attempt to deflate this bread.The servers are knowledgeable and accommodating. Only gripe is that we ended up pouring our own water and refilling our Prosecco glasses on our own. However, they did redeem themselves when I had left my ticket to a concert at home and they printed it out for me. I just forwarded it on and the gentleman came back a few minutes later with it.

In comparison to Dosa on Valencia, definitely sub-par. First visit... they served entrees literally 30 seconds after serving appetizers... I sent them back and they came back another 30 seconds later... food was fine. Second time... came with a party of a whopping five people, and service was okay overall. Dosa had essentially no salt, however. For appetizer, ordered and elaborated to waiter that I wanted two double vada pav and one single vada pav ($26) but was instead charged for five single vada pav ($30). It wouldn&#39;t be a huge deal, but if you&#39;re charging me a mandatory 20% service fee because of my large party, your service should probably warrant it. Not worth the wait for the &#34;ambiance&#34; of the more hip location... I&#39;d rather go to Valencia for better execution and better food.

I horned in on a friend&#39;s dinner plans the other night, and he was gracious enough not to call me out on it. They were going to Dosa after seeing The Watchmen (bastidges saw it without me!), so I met them there at 7:30 on Saturday.The res was for 8, so we knew we had time to kill; we made our way to the bar and had a round while we waited. Very creative and yummy - although I&#39;m personally not a fan of gin, which is the base for most of their specialty drinks.Despite the crowd, we were seated on time, if not a few minutes early! We were seated upstairs, so we had a great view of the place - really added to the experience! The light fixtures are beautiful, and the overall atmosphere is fairly right on.The five of us agreed to do the 4-course tasting with wine, and the food was truly delicious. We actually loved the &#34;crack chicken&#34; (aka channai chicken) so much as starters that we ordered another round for the table to share! So 2 orders from the tasting menu, *and* an additional one! Yowza.The rest of the food was quite good, but the desserts were disappointing. I understand it&#39;s a different kind of sweet, so perhaps that wasn&#39;t the fault of the kitchen but more a question of incompatible palates.Even more disappointing, though, were the wine pairings! Perhaps they should rethink what they&#39;re offering: maybe just do white wines/cocktail or beer pairings instead? None of the wines I had was particularly complementary to the food; they might have been fine on their own, but the point of a pairing is to bring out the flavors of both - right?I&#39;ll definitely try again, but probably forgo the tasting menu - and certainly the wine pairings and dessert!Oh, and the meal ended up being a little more expensive than I expected, especially considering the wine/dessert situations. Our bad for not voicing our dissatisfaction at the time.

My first experience at the Valencia Dosa was so good, a rich memory even years later. And I&#39;ve always wanted to try their brunch, so it was perfect chance to go to the new location on fillmore. After weeks of nagging anyone who would listen, finally made it this morning.I&#39;ll get this out of the way - definitely prefer the mission location. Maybe it&#39;s my need for a little urban edge in my surroundings, this Dosa was just too, um, sterile. Massive, almost cavernous, I think you could fit three of the original inside. Didn&#39;t add to the ambiance at all. And the music was an odd mix of indian and pop. Odd.But forget all that, because the food was awesome. To start, we split the fruit napolean, a sweet uttapam (thicker dosa) topped with fruit and and complemented by strawberry chutney and yogurt on the side. Delicious. For my main I had the egg poriyal dosa. Was initially bummed that 1) egg whites were not an option and 2) they couldn&#39;t take the chiles out (something about it being pre mixed), but I ended up being rather impressed. Not oily at all, and as the waiter promised, it wasn&#39;t really spicy. I got three filled dosas and some soup concoction on the side. For $10, it definitely felt worth it.Final verdict - a mediocre ambiance (my opinion) with terrific food. If you are only going to do to one, I highly, highly recommend the original down in the mission, but food wise, you can&#39;t go wrong either way.

Whoa! This is good, very good!Love at first light! From the door to the wall, the place just welcomes you! The service is outstanding.Unlike the other Dosa location (I have not been there in a long time), the acoustics here is good. You can hear the guy (or girl) across the table.Oh, about the food - wonderful. I am used to high-end places not delivering on authenticity. But this place rocks on that count too. Go for the Habanero Dosa if you got balls :-)

I&#39;ve been twice here so far, once for lunch and once for dinner.The Good: The food is good, the drinks are good, and I seriously hope the interior designer got a bonus cause this place is beautiful. The Masala dosa, bhatura, and vada sambar are things I&#39;ve been craving since going. Prices are fair and not as high as you&#39;d think judging from the looks of the place.The &#34;Eh&#34;: Like many reviewers have already said, even with a reservation, there will still be a wait, and some of the servers lack knowledge of their own menu (this was a lunch experience). Not traditional fare in any way. When was the last time you saw an egg section on the menu at Naan &#39;N Curry?The Bad: Your food comes out fast and hot, but once your order is finished, don&#39;t expect to see your server unless you&#39;re good at catching fireflies (Sorry, Dosa, but I personally think it a failure when water glasses are left empty, especially if you&#39;re serving spicy food). And the jumbo jet-engine hand dryers in the bathroom might&#39;ve blown my first layer of skin off.

Dosa is solid, a place you can count on for delicious cocktails and tasty south Indian food. As someone who doesn&#39;t care much for northern Indian eats, Dosa was the first southern style spot I tried and turned me onto how awesome dosas and uttapams really are, especially when served with fresh vegetables and flavorful dipping sauces. I like bringing out-of-towners to Dosa, as it tends to be a crowd-pleaser. I can&#39;t recommend the entree-type curries, but only because I stick with small plates (the fire broth and bright salads) or the right half of the menu (dosas + uttapams).I like the communal table, I like the bar, and I like the normal tables, too. I don&#39;t like to wait here, so typically opt for one of the first two options unless we&#39;ve made a reservation.The service can be off and I&#39;ve had water poured on me (and a cocktail, accidentally, too) and seen it dumped on others (as in, a full pitcher down a guy&#39;s back at a neighboring table the last time I was in).

This place ROCKS!!! We have been in the US for the past 5 years and this was the BEST, I MEAN IT, the best Indian food we have had in the US. The Egg-Masala and Rava Masala dosas were great. Authentic Indian Chutnies. Totally satisfying and reasonably priced for a decent location in San Francisco.Highly Recommended and will definitely go many more times :)

First trip to Dosa Fillmore last night (a Thrs). Was first struck by the space. It&#39;s huge compared to Valencia and gorgeous. It&#39;s got an &#39;upscale Indian&#39; sensibility. The monster windows are fantastic as well.Hostess service was great. They greeted us with a smile and were happily offered to take our coats and seat us.Our server left a little to be desired. She was very disinterested and once entrees were served was a ghost. We gave the benefit of the doubt but still had to ask a busboy to get her so we could order another bottle of wine. I think this was a unique experience based on watching service at other tables.Food was excellent. We started with the North-South Samosa&#39;s the HOT sauce was great. The Chile Prawns were also very well prepared, not too hot but enough kick to be interesting.Our entrees were Peppercorn Chicken and the Duck Spinach masala. The chicken was awesome...Highly recommended.We had a couple of $36 bottles of Pinot that we were very pleased with. They have a well rounded wine list that&#39;s a plus.Quick recapDecor *****Hostess *****Server *Busboys *****Food *****Definitely will return and recommend!

If I&#39;m going strictly for the food, I usually wind up at the Valencia location because it&#39;s small and comfortable and walking distance to great Mission bars. But if you&#39;re going for ambiance, Fillmore is your spot. The decor is as gorgeous as the clientele. The food is just as good at the Fillmore location as it is on Valencia. I would recommend a reservation at either location.

My friend insisted that we try this place and initially I was skeptical over the hype for dosa.. But this place is awesome!! It is v upscale and the decor is soo beautiful.. Their drink menu was also interesting.I had the South Indian monsoon and I loved it for its ginger and mint with pomegranate/mango combination.My friend loved her peony drink which had hibiscus masala and coconut milk.For appetizers, we ordered dahi vada (which came plated so beautifully that i dint want to eat it!), vada pav. For entree, My favorite was basil dosa.. Just the combination of indian spices and basil was wonderful. I also loved the uttapam and masala dosa..This is a pricey place but worth it.

Beautiful Bollywood interiors, super cool bar. The food is excellent, different from other Indian restaurants in SF. I always order the paper dosas.The service is uneven. One of us ordered a cocktail which took forever to arrive, then the person serving us was replaced by someone else who did manage to get the bartender to finally make the drink. Phew! These personnel mishaps should not be happening anymore in a restaurant that has been open for many months.Read the rest of the reviews here, it seems management has a management problem.

What I loved about Dosa unfortunately, was not the food, but the restaurant accomodations. The cozy decor, the ambient lighting, the spectacular chandeliers, the high-backed chairs, the sparkly bar... all together make for a beautiful restaurant experience. But the food didn&#39;t impress me much...We ordered the Masala Dosa - had never had one before, not even when I was in India! When the dosa arrived, there wasn&#39;t a lot of food on the plate. The curried potatoes were good and the flaky bread was fine but it looked as though they forgot to fill the plate with the rest of the food! I wanted more! Also had the Crab Vadas and again.. it didn&#39;t impress.. I&#39;ve had much better crabcakes.I also had the Tamil Vegetable Curry which had a very off color - it was the color of gray brain matter... no joke! I thought to myself, &#34;Ok.... interesting color... maybe it&#39;s good... I&#39;ll give it a try.&#34; It was bland and there weren&#39;t enough vegetables for the amount of curry that was in it. I had to nibble off of Ryry&#39;s delicious Magalorian Prawn Masala to try to make my meal a complete one. Ryry&#39;s mom loved her Tamil Lamb Curry. Too bad I don&#39;t eat lamb.For the prices that they charge, the food should be better and there should be more of it! But I guess, again, I chose the wrong dishes =/ Any suggestions?

You must try their prawn curry and other curries away from the typical dosas if you are going there again. Get the coconut rice with it. Also skip appetizers as they are tiny and can;t be shared and go directly to the main course.

We had dinner there last Monday before a concert. Three of us shared and there was plenty to fill us up.We got there a little before the dinner hour and sat at the bar and had a drink. The barkeep was busy chatting to another couple at the bar and said we&#39;d have to wait. He acted like he couldn&#39;t be bothered. If he thinks he is being suave he is sadly mistaken. He acted like an idiot being nonchalant to the point of rudeness. It wasn&#39;t busy at all and we were not served until a *nice lady* came out from the back and got us our drinks.Appetizer: Prawn Chile Fry - flavors were good, but the prawns were overcooked (hard and very dry) and rather too salty.Bhatura: I am not sure what the point is of this puffy bread. It was kinda flavorless.Dinner: Bagara Baingan - I am ambivalent when it comes to eggplant, but this was absolutely delicious. *drool*Chicken &#34;Dumm&#34; Biryani - also very good.I will definitely have to go back and try the Uttapam and Dosa.I ordered a beer with dinner, Pinkus, from Germany - a Hefeweissen which was excellent. Even at $9 a bottle, I found myself having a second!!We sat at a table in the bar area for dinner and the waitress was very attentive and super nice. She got an extra tip for getting our order in and bringing our food quickly.

I love authentic indian food and was very disappointed in what I ate at Dosa -almost impossible to find a whole vegetable dish and they wouldn&#39;t change any existing dish to my taste-it felt like pre-packaged dishes serve to a hip crowd.However, they have some interesting recipes and mostly the decor is worth having a drink.

Cool decor n ambiance, but the hallmark of a good restaurant is the food... And this place was a notch above ok. I got a lunch dosa with a lemonade. My paneer and peas dosa was greasier than it needed to be and the lemonade came in this scrimpy glass that I managed to finish in 2 gulps. I know i know, these upscale places give the &#34;proper&#34; portions n what not ... but I felt a cool drink on a hot day could have been at least the size of the water glass.I&#39;ll still go back and try more things, but wouldn&#39;t go out of my way for it.

Ive been to both dosa&#39;s and both are excellent, but decided to review the fillmore location since I just went there a couple weeks ago. We made reservations in advance and were seated fairly promptly...maybe waited 10 min. We had really fun cocktails at the bar. This location is very hip and larger than the mission spot.We took my brother and sis in law who came in from Scottsdale, AZ. They love indian food and south indian is different than the usual fare, and a definite treat for out of towners.We tried pretty much every section of the menu and every single dish was excellent. All the food was spicy, flavoful, and really fun to eat...playful but not messy. One standout dish I keep thinking about going back for is the chili spiced corn on the cob. It is so incredible. You have to try it. YUMMY!!I cannot wait to go back to DOSA. I only wish this location was walking distance to a bart station.

Dosa was AMAZING! Everything from the service, to the food, to the drinks, to the atmosphere was amazing from the minute that we walked through the door.We got to Dosa later in the evening; therefore we only had to wait about 15 minutes. In that time we grabbed a drink at the bar. I had one of the best lemon drop martinis that I have ever had. The bartender was also very knowledgeable and friendly. Warning: the drinks are strong, but since they are mixed so well you won&#39;t even notice.Moving right along, the food was the best that I have had in the city so far. I didn&#39;t know what to expect; therefore I asked the waiter plenty of questions and he was very helpful. I ended up with the spring dosa and it was delicious. My boyfriend had the chicken and eggplant baingan bharta and his mom had lamb curry and they both agreed that their dish was great, but the spring dosa was the winning dish of the night. We also had the onion pekora and the chennai chicken for an appetizer and they were both very good and the right size for an appetizer; not to small, not to big. We finished our meal off with the toasted coconut and saffron barfi dessert. Despite the weird and slightly disgusting name the toasted barfi was very tasty!The service was the best in any restaurant so far. The seating hostess was great, the bartender was knowledgeable as well as the waiter. My boyfriend dropped his fork on the floor when he sat down and he didn&#39;t even have to ask for another fork. Within minutes one of the wait staff came over with a new fork and replaced the fork that had been dropped! The bussing staff removed plates and refilled water so smoothly and efficiently that you would hardly notice what they were doing. They were great at their job.Lastly, the atmosphere was very nice. It was dark, but not too dark. They had a nice selection of music that was at the right volume. I have been in a lot of places where the music is so loud that I can hardly hear myself think, but Dosa was not one of these places.I will return to Dosa for more dosas and you should definitely give it a try!

Overall this is a pretty cool place. Totally trendy decor but I admit, it is pretty awesome. The place is large but I would recommend getting a reservation as it can get crowded. They have some of those &#34;community&#34; tables which can be fun but I&#39;ve found the service is not as good here. Try their Dosa, it&#39;s great (what a shocker, right?)!I think this is a good date place as well as a good group place. The prices are reasonable...if you like Indian food (South Indian I believe) you will be happily surprised...plus it&#39;s cool to finally visit an Indian restaurant with such modern decor!

Great food, great service, and what a beautiful restaurant!!!! Thankfully, we had a reservation - the place was packed on a Saturday night. The waiter was even flirty, which made for a fun meal!They have at $35 tasting menu which was fantastic. One appetizer, 2nd course, and main course.I got a salad for my appetizer, which was tasty. It was an interesting mix of greens, roots, and some crazy pears which were spiced, and didn&#39;t appear to be pears at all.I had a dosa for my 2nd course - super tasty. One of the sauces was SUPER spicy and I had to order a beer because my tongue was burning off.The main course was a veggie curry, which was delicious!!We had a chocolate cake for dessert, with vanilla ice cream, which was yummy too.Their specialty cocktail menu is also interesting...some spicy drinks, some sweet drinks.I would definitely go back.

Went there for dinner with my parents who are visiting from the east coast. Did an early dinner because of baby Noah. My parents loved it when they were here last time (in the Mission), so I insisted they see the new spot.Service was excellent - very patient and accommodating with us having a baby at the table.Food was outstanding, I&#39;ve always liked the food, but tonight I ate something that is now my new favorite menu item: Kerala Fish Moilee. This dish has a perfect combination of heat, sweetness and creamy texture. For dessert I tried the Rasmalai and this was unbelievably good.Anjan came by to say hello and let us know that there is a changing station for the baby in the bathroom. Little gestures like these make a world of difference.My parents LOVED their food and commented numerous times on the beautiful decor.

DOSA is very delicious!!! There is a lot to choose from but everything i have had so far seems top notch. The wait staff has been very friendly to me and helped me out a lot during my visits. The selection of beers is rather large and tasty but their cocktails really don&#39;t suit my taste. They are a bit too exotic. This is a great place for early dinner because the atmosphere is eloquent, but my only complaint is that the place really packs you in tight. Sometimes it&#39;s as if you are sitting at the same table as the people next to you. To me the food is worth the sardine feeling... other&#39;s may disagree. It&#39;s best to get there earlier than later.

I ate here last night with some good friends. The food was great, but I think I prefer northern Indian food. This was the first time I had ever had a Dosa, and it was definitely good, but I really love curry, and I really love saag paneer. It was nice for a change, but I&#39;ll stick to my usual Indian cuisine. Amber India is still the best in the city.

It was just o.k.. I read about Dosa on SFGate. It was listed in the Top 100. I am a chef and maybe a little more critical, but I hope this is not a top 100 restaurant in one of the richest food areas in the world. The Dosa were nice and Kale Slaw was interesting, but certainly nothing fabulous. For what you are getting the price is about 20% too high as well. With all of that said, we had an excellent waiter and the restaurant had great ambiance.

Went here on a Thursday night for drinks and dinner - made a reservation and was so glad we did! There were quite a few people waiting! We had a drink at the bar as we arrived a little early and the cocktails were delicous! Perfectly refreshing!We were seated and enjoyed our pleasant servers greeting and recommendations on the menu - we went for a lamb dish along with a vegetarian dish as she recommended. Everything was so yummy - we will definitely come back!This was definitely a great restaurant - I would give it a 5 star rating but my one complaint is that my boyfriend and I had a table that basically you have to slide real close to another table to get in and out - this was the case throughout the restaurant - as I understand they obviously want to feed as many people as possible!We will definitely return for some more drinks and dinner - great spot - if you love indian food I would defintely recommend trying it out - and making a reservation when you do!

More like 3.5 stars. Not bad!! Tall ceilings, nice atmosphere, friendly waitstaff.I got the 4-course meal. Started off with the red beet cumin soup, which was creamy &amp; delicious. Was a bit spicy, but it went well with the creme fraiche. Then got the chutney masala dosa &amp; loved the different dips and sauces. This particular dosa, I believe, was larger than some of the other ones. had some potatoes and eggplant it in. Yum. It was surprisingly spicier than I expected for something served to the general public without fair warning. For me, it was the perfect level of spiciness, but I could see it being intolerable for some people. Then, I got the Tamil lamb curry. The lamb meat was super tasty and soft, yet chewy. Not tough at all. Just perfect. And I got the little indian doughnut in syrup, which was much better than I&#39;m used to at the little greasy indian buffets. Topped it off with their chai tea, which was milkier than I expected, but I love milk, so, I loved it!I don&#39;t know how authentic the food here is; it&#39;s obviously a lot fancier and schmancier (not to mention pricier) than the average indian buffet grub that i&#39;m used to. however, change is good sometimes. in fact, it&#39;s so fancy that i saw people taking pictures of the ceiling and wall decorations! of course, they looked asian and touristy, but still.

This is one slick looking restaurant. The space is quite large and the lighting is beautiful with large chandeliers and large booths throughout the restaurant. I had a meal here with some friends on a Friday night. Between the Kabuki theater and Dosa, the area was very crowded.The food was wonderful. The menu itself is a but overwhelming because there are several choices and many categories. Because I was with three other people we were able to order tons of food, which was great because I had the opportunity to taste everything. The favorite of the table was the dosa - duh. I am of the opinion that if a particular dish is in the name of the restaurant the you MUST order it. The dosa was large and filled with delicious curried potatoes. The dosa and all of our apps came with several dipping sauces. I also loved the spicy prawns, they were so red that they really did look angry - but boy were they tasty. My friend who does not like shrimp even tried one and she loved it too.The curries are delicately flavored and many packed a punch at the end. The rice here is flavored and I much preferred the coconut rice to the lemon rice, but both were good. The samosas were good, but nothing too special (particularly considering the price). Good service and the food came out quickly, which was great since we were so hungry.

This is a restaurant you just have to try period! I went and got the paper masala which was fun and delicious! Although it was enormous and there is no way i will ever finish one this is a new favorite of mine and i will be returning. My friends highly suggest the chutney masala so that will be my next test!My recommendation: order a beer with your dosa, it has spice and beer was a great compliment to it and order the Bhatura before your meal.. so tasty and fun to eat.

Dosa with the Mosa!Mmmm, I&#39;ve been dying to go here since hearing of the newly opened, green, chic sister restaurant. And last night my wish came true. The three of us opted for the tasting menu and paired wine. I&#39;d highly suggest doing this, especially if you are going for the first time.Spice, saucy, rich. Hello, heaven! Dosa is like a crepe (if you didn&#39;t know) and my eyes were bulging with jealously as other tables were receiving theirs -- until mine came. My very own. I&#39;d definitely go for the lentil soup for mixin&#39; and pairin&#39; as its flavors give the rest of the ingredients a better level of richness.Also, stick with the less-sweet wine pairings as my friend didn&#39;t seem to find them as complimentary as mine (he was jealous as I gulped mine down).Why am I not giving five stars? I&#39;m a big fan of paying attention to people when they say they are allergic to such food items as shellfish. They came out with shellfish and because of the heavy sauce, it was nearly engulfed. EEEk. Not OK. But what was OK, is that our waitress felt so bad she gave us Port pairings with our dessert.Delish, Dosa, delish.

I think this is the best Dosa as far as space and decor go.I went to this location 2 times within the past 2 weeks and both times were excellent.The Kerala Fish Moilee is TO DIE FOR - seriously, some of the best fish curry I have had.I also love the Tomato and Onion Uttapam and Crab Vadas.Best cocktail: Bengali GimletI do not like being charged $0.50 for extra coconut chutney, so I dock one star. And the Ras Malai - just not the same as homemade!A solid meal, great atmosphere, excellent, well informed staff.

A totally unexpected place in the neighborhood. A converted old Goodwill store - this place has gone through a whole transformation.I had to reserve a table a week in advance to make sure that my friends and I could get a table here for dinner. The ambiance and decor of the place very modern lounge. One thing that seemed out of place was the music selection that switched from techno beat indian music to pop top 40. wah happen?!A fan of spicy food, I found apps and entrees pretty good. Nothing really stood out to my taste buds except for their cocktails. I recommend checking out the Bengali Gimlet - it has a nice curry kick to it a unique flavor to a classic drink.

The food was excellent. Service was excellent. The prices can get kind of steep, but this isn&#39;t your average bay area Indian restaurant. This is the type of place you bring that special someone to eat a nice meal and soak up the ambiance before heading out on the town, or to the beach (if it&#39;s a nice day which is rare in SF) , or back home. There is plenty to chose from (a lot of Vegetarian options) as well as some fusion dishes for the adventurous of heart. If you&#39;re looking for a traditional Indian restaurant, then this might not be the place for you.

I&#39;ve been wanting to try this place for years now and finally made it here last Saturday night. The ambience was classy and the lights were dimmed down low. I had seriously under-estimated how busy it would get and failed to make a reservation. Luckily for my husband and I though, we were able to get in at 10pm. I tend not to dine this late, but since the movie theater was one block away we managed to grab a movie and make it in good time for dinner. So anyhoo.... the dosa&#39;s were phenomenal! They had every variety you could think of and the accompanying dips and the poppadoms were divine! We of course ordered the most expensive stuff on the menu - the vindaloo duck, the lamb curry and one of their stuffed dosa&#39;s - of which I forget the name. Everything was delicious, expecially the lamb. Would definately go back, particularly as this is a great place to dine with friends and family or on birthdays. It&#39;s kinda pricey though, so I&#39;m tempted to try their other location on Valencia for a cheaper treat! So worth it though and definately hit the spot! Drooooooooooooollllll!!! Since it was so dark in there I didn&#39;t get to take a pic to share on Yelp.

We were given a really bad time by a stuck up receptionist the first time we were there so we walked out. This time I went on my own just in case that was a one-off instance. Did get a helpful e mail from the owner regarding the incident. This time round everything was perfect. The receptionist (clearly someone else) the waitress ( perfect) and the Indian food on par with the best of London.

Dosa was awesome!I went last night with some peeps after a grueling day at the office.We arrived at 6pm-ish, and asked to sit at the tables in the bar area which is in a lot of ways, nicer than the main dining area. Dark, romantic lighting, a towering chandelier, leather chairs - it totally sets the mood. Premium cocktails for $5 - I recommend the &#34;Mood Indigo&#34; which is a citrus-y type drink. The drinks are very strong - I threw that baby back and relaxed immediately. Silly giggling ensued.Chennai Chicken is excellent - think Tandoori Chicken without the bone and a side of yogurt sauce. Even the slaw salad that accompanied it was good - there&#39;s a bevy of Indian spices mixed in - dare I say cumin and curry powder? Whatever it was, I will be ordering that again.Mung Salad - it&#39;s mung beans (or lentils) sitting on top of a mixed baby greens salad. It was good, but unsatisfying. Not good for guys. :)Cochin Calamari - delicious if you like spicy, curry / cumin spiced braised calamari. Soft and tender, moist and not at all chewy. Delicious, but if you have to choose between calamari and chicken, get the chicken.Now on to dinner -We got the Channa Bhatura and the Masala Dosa. We would have ordered more, but we got carried away with the cocktails. The Channa Bhatura was GOOD. It&#39;s a soft flatbread served with a side of chickpeas in a tomato-y, curry-like sauce. Excellent!The Masala Dosa was a dosa (ultra-thin pancake) filled with a potato/lentil filling with a side of 3 sauces. Very good as well.Dosa&#39;s strength is their ability to get the flavor of the sauces and curry spot on. Just the right amount of spice, saltiness and sweetness rounding out each tastebud, hitting all the right notes. Dipping dosas quickly becomes addicting.

Best South Indian food you can possible find anywhere. I think the Uthappums here can compete with the best in India. Try their Chef&#39;s selection of Uthappums that comes with 5 mini uthappums on a plate. I also like the Idli and Onion Rava Dosa here. You can book this restaurant on OpenTable and parking is easy in the parking lot across the street. I like this place better than the Dosa on Valencia because its easier to park here and the ambiance is better. The food and the service are equally good.I actually have also been here for brunch and really liked the unique egg-based Uthappums/Poriyals. I once tried their Chicken Biryani for lunch and thought it was too South Indian in taste (had mint leaves, etc.) and not what I was expecting from Biryani (mostly cooked in North Indian flavors/spices), but it was tasty nevertheless.

mmmmmmm i dont know about this place. We went for my dads bday because he really wanted to try it. I&#39;ve never tried Indian food before. We went on a Sunday night and the place was CROWDED, very surprised. We had to call 1 week in advance for reservations and they only had 1 table left, so it&#39;s very popular. I really didn&#39;t like any of the food, wasn&#39;t surprised that I didn&#39;t. However their salad was really good and the lamb was good. It seems like a lot of people like this place, so i&#39;d suggest for anyone who likes Indian food to try it out but if you have never tried it before, don&#39;t waste you time.

Exactly what I want out of a SF restaurant in this economy.Twelve bucks for lunch!?! Awesome. Love, love, love Dosa. When I arrived I had already decided I was getting the Mini Dosa and Salad combo. What I didn&#39;t count on was the fact that I had the hardest time picking what salad to choose from. After a split second decision made at the arrival of our server I chose the sprouted lentil salad and the paneer and pea dosa. Both were amazing. The amount of food was perfect and I liked nibbling on the (forgive the spellling here) pompadums they give you before your meal. The sprouted salad was crisp and refreshing and also had a beautiful presentation. The dosa was surprising light considering the ingredients and the peas inside were fresh.I already have dinner plans for next week so I can take the drink menu for a spin. All of their gin cocktails were calling my name and maybe an anachronistic Curry Bloody Mary may be in order. YUM!

I know there are some Dosa haters out there. But I am not one of them. (I&#39;m only docking a point for the sometimes ridiculous amount of time it takes to wait for a table.) I have been to Dosa several times (this place is 2 blocks from me) ,and I&#39;m never disappointed. I am stubbornly predictable each time... corn soup, chennai chicken, lamb kofta. If I&#39;m with a larger group, I&#39;ll throw in the ridiculously addictive paper dosa. My favorite dish, however, is hands-down the lamb kofta. I could drink the thick, spicy tomato sauce that it&#39;s served in. I will literally use the dosa to wipe clean the entire dish. If you like Indian food (read: heat), then don&#39;t listen to the haters and take a chance on this upscale street food. Trust me.

The food? A-mazing. The service? Lacking on Friday night 9/30/11-- hotel/corporate-type service: bussers bringing dishes to table not knowing who&#39;d ordered what. Dishes piled onto table without taking empty glasses and plates away to make a minimum of room. Also! Had to flag our friendly waiter to take our wine order after a good 10+ minutes. I mean, that&#39;s the first thing you get your table to order and get onto the table, right? It was a packed night, but still. The food is amazing though.

Dosa is a swanky place for some really good Indian cuisine. Went here to celebrate my new condo. Will have to come back again to see if it warrants another star or two. Ate upstairs, and Anna, our server, couldn&#39;t have been more professional, polite, and helpful. A+ on her part!Tried the $39 four-course menu, which was tasty. The lamb curry was out of this world as was the coconut sorbet for dessert. Other courses were good, but I don&#39;t recall what they were called as I&#39;d had a couple of glasses of tasty white wine and was on cold medication. Oh well.

The bartender took his time, made each drink with great care and even made sure the presentation of straws and garnish were perfect.We weren&#39;t disappointed. All three drinks were very tasty and very interesting. They&#39;re not cheap, but it&#39;s worth a try!

This is the best Indian restaurant in San Francisco, particularly if you like Southern Indian cuisine. For a huge space that is sleek and modern, the restaurant still manages to create an intimate ambiance. The servers were attentive and knowledgeable, particularly when it came to sizing portions and drink selections for a large group. There was also a bold and large artisianal cocktail menu, particularly for those larger parties that were looking to get after it a bit on a Saturday night. I recommend their &#39;ginerade&#39; drink, and any of the chicken and fish of the day dishes paired with the dosa.

I had been to the original Dosa once before (including the hour plus wait outside) and had adored the experience. During that trip, we waited double our quoted time, but were given papadam on the street by the hostess to tide us over and a free appetizer for our patience. Not to mention, the food was wonderful.This new Dosa is a block from my house, and since I adore Indian food, this seems like a dream come true. Knowing this was opening week, my boyfriend and I headed down around 6:45 on a Wednesday for dinner.Walking into the restaurant, I definitely was wowed by the decor. The place was spacious and lovely. Very trendy, reminding me of New York, but not pretentiously so. I approved. I asked the hostess for a table for two and she told me that there was a wait, around 20-30 minutes, and told me to have a seat.I didn&#39;t mean to be rude, but I gave a shocked look around the restaurant, which was less than half full. I didn&#39;t ask why, on opening week just before 7 they were making people wait when they had a ton of open tables, even though it was clear that every person who walked in after me wondered the same thing. I did have to wait the full 30 minutes for a table, and for this fact alone I almost gave the restaurant 3 stars. I have no idea why they kept so many 2-tops open for 20 minutes and made everyone mill at the bar, other than to sell a couple cocktails and give the strange illusion of being busy when they clearly were not.I figure coming here on the weekend will always entail at least an hour wait, but that&#39;s how the last Dosa was, so come prepared to stand at the bar and sip a drink.We ordered two cocktails at the bar, and they were nice. I can&#39;t say great, but interesting. Mine was spicy and full of mango, and I didn&#39;t really fancy it (the spiciness got old faster than I would have guessed) but that might just be because it was so different from what I usually drink. I also didn&#39;t think the drink was very alcoholic, which was a bit of a shame, given the price, but that also happens at restaurants. I would not recommend coming to this place planning on getting buzzed on two martinis. It might not happen.When we sat, service was very slow in the beginning. It took at least seven minutes for the waitress to come to us, but she was nice, took our orders, and the dishes were served promptly and were well-spaced. We got Samosas, a Masala Dosa, and the Duck Curry. All of these dishes were drop dead amazing, and it was more than enough food for two hungry people. And while we thought the end price would be expensive, the meal was around $40 all told (not counting our drinks, those would be an extra $20) which to me is more than reasonable for the quality of food we got.I will definitely be coming back to Dosa. I would like to say a lot, but honestly, the wait might make this be more like a once-a-month trip instead of a once-a-week. However, all the food is top notch, interesting, and affordable, especially for the atmosphere and quality.

The reservation was made for 9pm but didn&#39;t get seated till a little pass 10. It&#39;s definitely not a good place for a big party of 12. Despite that, the ambiance is great to hangout with friends. We were here on a Saturday night and the place was crowded and it could get pretty loud. I couldn&#39;t quite hear what my friends were saying without moving my ears close to their lips.We ordered some chennai chicken and cochin calamari as appetizers. They were pretty good. But the best must be the dosas. I had the Rava Masala ( A wispy dosa made of semolina and wheat, served with spiced Indian potatoes, onions and cashews). It was wonderful. The dosa was crispy. The potatoes just melted in my mouth. I literally drank the sauce.I tried a bit of other stuffs like the lamb curry and chicken curry. They were decent. I still would go for the dosas.I would come back to try a different type of dosa again and the dessert.

Had dinner here in a party of 6 last night. Reservation was made, so we were seated promptly upon arrival. Even though it was a Sunday evening, the dining room was busy (probably due to the Cherry Blossom Festival). Service was great. The Waitress we had was attentive but not too much. Waiters bringing us food were eager to teach us how to eat some of the dishes. Decoration was to our liking as well, very modern.One good thing about dining in a big group is we got to try a lot of dishes :)Appetizer: Crab Vadas, Cochin CalamariEntree: Jumbo Prawns Masala, Chicken &#34;Dumm&#34; Biryani, Kerala Fish Moilee, Masala Dosa, Paneer &amp; Peas Dosa, Masala UttapamDessert: Toasted Coconut &amp; Saffron Barfi, Shrikand &amp; Diced Seasonal Fruits, Sweet PongalFood was overall delicious - especially the fish dish. Rice was cooked with a little too much water, so the biryani turned out mushy. I&#39;ve been to Coimbatore and Chennai so wouldn&#39;t call this place authentic. But again, would I go to Osha and expect authentic Thai?Will definitely consider coming back for the next special occasion.

We went to DOSA last Saturday before the Jackie Greene show at the Fillmore. What a great experience! We sat at the bar before our reservation and had drinks and samosas. The samosas were very tasty. We were seated almost immediately after checking in and had great, very attentive service. We each had the tasting menu ($35) and it was quite a bit of food, especially after the samosas. The calamari first course was delicious! The curry entrees (vegetarian and lamb) were perfect. And, of course, the bread! We ended with the &#34;honey and fig&#34; gelato (we ate it in a daze, just coming out of our food coma). It was fantastic!

This is one of my favorite places to go. I recommend grabbing a couple of friends and filling the table with great food to sample from. Be prepared to spend $35-50 depending on how much you drink.Oh, and try their signature gin &amp; tonic!

My newest coffee table book is on famous chefs&#39; final meals. It makes you think... &#34;what would mine be?&#34;Well, I&#39;ve revised my menu after visiting Dosa Fillmore. If I were going down, I&#39;d want to have their chickpea curry as part of my bon voyage meal. It doesn&#39;t sound like something that would be last meal worthy, right? Wrong, it was more flavorful than many of the meat dishes I&#39;ve had lately, and it&#39;s served along with the most amazing huge puffy bread. This is not to even mention that the atmosphere is one of the best in the City, the scene is buzzing, the rest of their food is delicious as well, or that the wine and cocktail list are creative and top quality. Forget all that... just go, get the chickpea curry, and die happy.

Went here late on a Saturday, didnt really know what to expect but it looked nice. The space is very nice, good feel overall.Our first server was I believe just getting off work, because after asking for our drink order we saw her counting cash near the kitchen, completely ignoring the fact we were ready to order. Finally we got a new server who came over and helped, but she seemed like she didnt want to be there.Think it may have just been a bad night, will have to try it again.

Date night at Dosa! I made a reservation on OpenTable for Friday @ 8pm. We walked in at 8, and were seated immediately. I was impressed to say the least as the restaurant was buzzing with patrons. Our waitress was very attentive and knew the menu extensively.We started off with a glass of champagne and a beer for myself. The Taj Mahal is a great choice for those beer drinkers. We ordered the Crab Vadas as a starter. It was great! The mint sauce was very well done.After being overwhelmed by the menu, the waitress suggested we get a Dosa and an entree as the portions were perfect for two. I was hesitant as I have read the reviews about the portions, but rolled the dice. We decided on the Spring Dosa and the Peppercorn Chicken entree (with lemon rice).The Spring Dosa was great! Perfect for two people. The Dosa had three rolls with dipping sauce and two chutneys. The Peppercorn Chicken was pretty good but I had some issues with cutting good pieces of chicken off. I kept getting bombed with chunks of peppers or herbs that were used to cook the dish. The sauce is very thick and it makes it hard to distinguish. The lemon rice was great! I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ll order the Peppercorn Chicken again.Overall, it was a great place to dine and even on a Friday night, the service was impressive. We got out of there with a couple rounds of drinks, starter, dosa, and entree for less than $70. safe to say I&#39;ll be back.

I love this place. We been here three times - twice for dinner and once for lunch. Loved their lunch menu and it&#39;s much cheaper too with less crowd during lunch hour. I&#39;m giving 4 stars because sometimes the food can be bit spicy and they don&#39;t offer mild curry since it&#39;s pre-cooked.

This place has a great, swanky atmosphere with high ceilings, two floors of seating, and a happening bar scene (thirty-somethings crowd). Great place for a date or to have a Sex and the City-esque night with your girlfriends. the cocktails are creative, though some of the ones using Indian spices tasted a little funny. The dosas there are good, but though I&#39;m no expert on Indian cuisine, I think this place hits higher notes for its atmosphere than the authenticity of the food. Still good, though. Would definitely come back!

Dosa on Fillmore feels so much more open than Dosa on Valencia. Also lots of natural light and a beautiful bar. Generally easy to get seated without too long of a wait. They do switch up their menu from time to time but the new items can be a hot or miss. I tend to play it safe and stick to the traditional south Indian dishes like the masala dosa&#39;s (spicy mung) and uppams. The drinks are fun; and pricey too!

We had an excellent meal at Dosa this past Friday. We ordered the spring and the habanero dosas - both excellent, the lamb curry - yum! and the chicken byriani - which was a little dry, but in all fairness, the server warned us it was going to be and brought us a sauce that came with it to moisten it.We also got the crab cake, which was also rather tasty. For dessert, we were not so impressed with the rice pudding, but the coconut sorbet was out of this world.I am certainly going to return to this restaurant.

If you are looking for a fancy evening out with awesome cocktails and ok indian food, I recommend this place. I would give it 5 stars for the ambiance but the last time I was there 2 things bothered me about the food: 1) they have altered their menu from about 2 years back and removed items that I really enjoyed e.g. tamil lamb curry 2) the taste felt worse than the same items at their Valencia location.Hence the overall 3 stars. I would give their valencia location 4 stars.

Had to come to try the paper masala dosa and will be returning to try everything else! Everything on the menu was really tempting. We got whatever their version of crab cakes was - and that was ok. The paper masala was great and all the dipping sauces were very creative. I personally loved the coconut spread. We shared an entree of prawns in a rich red sauce. Everything was spiced perfectly and the portions were a very good size.Back to the paper masala. It was HUGE could easily split between 4 people. It was slightly greasy, very thin and I&#39;ve never tasted anything like it. I probably won&#39;t order that again, next time we&#39;ll try the regular dosa.The price was really good. We didn&#39;t have drinks so of course that helps keep the bill down but for both of us, we left pretty full the total was only around $40. We were expecting much more for the beautiful decor and swanky ambiance. Thx for the suggestion 7x7 - it&#39;s been a great find for us!

Could be a great place to eat but, eating there on a weekend was crappy. I made reservations so I didn&#39;t have to wait but, I was disappointed with almost everything that hit the table. The food wasn&#39;t horrible but, not that good. The wait staff tried but came up short. Worst factor? The NOISE! When that place is full, you have to yell.

Went to Dosa on Fillmore for dinner last night - thought it would be a nice place for a dinner date and it was close by to an after dinner Japantown kareoke birthday party that we had planned to go to.My review of the restaurant is mixed. We ordered a starter (the calimari), a South Indian Entree (the lamb curry), and a dosa (the cheese and peas one) to share. This was what the waiter recommended we do. For two people this was a whole lot of food - we were both hungry walking in and yet ate only a little more than half of the food. Indian food tends to expand in your stomach and it seemed like we were more full an hour after dinner than we were when we left the restaurant.I&#39;d be interested to learn more about the different between North Indian and South Indian. The waiter briefly explained that North Indian has more entree style dishes (I think that&#39;s what she said). And, I am more used to things like Indian curries and I love biryani. So, the lamb curry was excellent - a little spicy, but not too much.The starter was also good - also a little spicy, but not too much. The dosa was really different than anything I had eaten before. It&#39;s like a cross between a crepe and a burrito. It came with two chutneys and a dipping sauce, two of which I enjoyed.But, I didn&#39;t leave licking my fingers and immediately wanting to go back. Perhaps I just prefer North Indian food, but I would much rather get a $10 plate of lamb biryani at Pakwan than go to Dosa again.I will say that the atmosphere is really nice - especially the upstairs, which feels a little more intimate. The downstairs is much more open and spacious which kind of gives it a lounge-bar feel. So, it&#39;s nice to have both in one location.

So, after 4 visits to Dosa on Filmore, I had to make a decision as to just how much I liked the place.Food ~~ It&#39;s good. It&#39;s a little different than the mom &amp; pop Indian restaurant. Is it great? Well, it&#39;s good, have I raved about it? Not really. If it comes up in conversation, I say it&#39;s good, I love the chandeliers, you know, the two that look like jellyfish floating over you... Do I say great things about the food. Not really. I like it, it&#39;s tasty, the Dosa is different, the drinks are good, and very interesting.Service ~~ so this is where the hit points come in. Service has been (believe it or not) spotty. As an example. We dined there last night. Our server says to us, that he thinks he waited on us before. My partner agrees it&#39;s possible. The server as he&#39;s talking to us I feel the spray of spittle on my cheek. Now, this happens in life. We all have those embarrassing moments where something like this happens. I KNOW this, so I say nothing, and after he leaves, I wipe my cheek, and enjoy my drink &amp; conversation. The server returns later in the evening, and yes, low and behold it happens AGAIN! OK, so this time I&#39;m a little concerned b/c it happens so frequently. I tell my partner who is immediately grossed out. As it is, the server happens to have the table next to us too. He is telling them about how the owners of Dosa follow Yelp regularly. Our server never comes back to refill my water (ever), and until after I&#39;m done with the main course does he happen back to ask if I want another drink.NOT very good service. It he really waited on us before, and did this poorly prior. I doubt I would have come back. I&#39;m amazed that he talked about the owners being concerned by what was said on Yelp, and still he did a poor job with service.I guess his bosses read Yelp, and he doesn&#39;t.

Five stars for ambience... really nice!Five stars for the creative cocktails!Four stars for the food... I am not generally a lover of Indian cuisine, but everything was extremely fresh and tasty... but a bit heavier than I am used to- again the Indian cuisine thing... But... when any of my friends wants to eat Indian food, this is where I will suggest we come.Three stars for the service... our server was professional, but not outstanding. No complaints, but no raves either.Overall a really nice place that I would absolutely frequent again.

I was thrilled to find out that one of my fave spots in the city was opening a location in my hood. hooray!Back in November, my boyfriend and I arranged a night out for a bunch of friends and ended up picking the new dosa for dinner. As it happened, we stumbled on opening night! Since then, I&#39;ve been back twice... once for drinks only and once for dinner with some people from the office.The service has steadily improved, definitely symptomatic of the growing pains of any new restaurant. The food is really good and so are the drinks. The green building conversion of the old Goodwill space was extremely well done. It&#39;s gorgeous!

Refreshing alternative to the many Northern Indian restaurants in SF, possibly the glitziest and busiest Indian restaurant in the city.MUST order one of the dosas and a side of coconut rice (*droooool*).... we also sampled the Caramelized Onion uttapam and Mango Jumbo Prawns - both were outstanding. Generous portions, fresh ingredients and a tantalizingly varied menu - what&#39;s not to like?Service is excellent - the staff graciously accommodated a tomato allergy (thankfully not mine!) amongst our group.

Went here the first day it opened. Service was great, food was tasty and atmosphere is fabulous as it has a great decor... We sat upstairs and could people watch.Be careful if you have nut allergies. Our guest does and even though they were very careful... the wait staff tried with consulting the kitchen, they were not as familar with the ingredients and our guest had a reaction. Most of the sauces and foods contain cashews, so please be careful if you have this type of allergy... I had to run to the corner store and fortunately, they had Benadryl...Food was great and they comp&#39;ed our meal due to the nut allergy... can&#39;t ask for more.Pricey...

Yes, you can get cheaper masala dosas at most hole in the wall South Indian places. So I wanted to dislike this place. But it was great. Here&#39;s why- Ambiance. Just awesome. Beautiful spacious. No offense, but as an Indian myself, I am appalled at how awful the ambiance and setting is at most South Indian restaurants. Not here. Gorgeous.- Creativity. The spring dosa and paneer dosa were creative, original, and well done- Presentation. The food looked beautiful on the plate/All of the above usually means a $35-40 and up main + starter anywhere else. Here, you can easily get a meal for under $20 (no drinks).The food itself was excellent as well, and the service was great too. All around, a great addition to your &#34;must dine at&#34; list and 4 stars from me.

For a starter, I tried the samosa small plate. Although good, it wasn&#39;t anything different from what I have had at other Indian restaurants. For the main entree, I had the prawn masala and coconut rice. I also tried the poori. While the coconut rice complemented the masala well, I just didn&#39;t find them to be anything special. The poori was quite delish, though. There definitely has to be better Indian food in San Fran at a better price point. Coming here means paying for the ambiance.

I don&#39;t really give out many 5 stars but dosa gets one for being a unique place as well as delicilous.There are not many fine dining Indian places that are swanky, sheik and modern. They really pulled it off here.The cocktails are creative and not foofy.The fire broth soup is just what you will crave the next time you succumb to a cold.The fish with coconut sauce was flakey and perfectly cooked. Not to mention pleantifulThe coconut rice was so light and fluffy I could stuff my pillow with it and slip off into a deep sleep.The service was great, our server cute and sweet.The place was full but you could still hear yourself talk without raising your voice.Thank god they put this place in ... the Burger King and the Goodwill on opposing corners were creating a homeless vortex :)

One of the most impressive interiors to a restaurant in the city, IMHO...You don&#39;t feel like you&#39;re in SF when you&#39;re here.Great use of space, lighting and decor...Couldn&#39;t really stop checking out everything...Everything except for a large sized photo on one of the walls that both seemed to be out of place and placed too low for such a large wall &amp; restaurant.Service and getting a table is not the best aspect of this place...If anything, it feels a bit disorganized in that respect.Bartender was great and made some great recommendations both on drinks and the food.Not the most impressive dosas, especially considering it&#39;s named after them, but the overall quality of the food and portions were pretty good.Some things were hit and some things were miss.The Chennai chicken is a starter but the oil was the predominant taste we got from them...Either go larger pieces of chicken or dial back the oil would be my recommendation.Dahi Vada was recommened by the bartender and a good choice...Pretty tasty but think it could&#39;ve been better if it had a bit more kick from the chutneys and perhaps were warm instead of cold.Favorite dish by a landslide was the channa...Perfectly flavored and reminded me of some of the best Channa I&#39;d ever had...Just delish and would definitely return just for that.

I was having a low blood-sugar moment when we walked through the door, but they were so nice and professional, and made sure to bring some water right away. The food was out-of-this-world yummy; I can&#39;t wait to bring friends here!

White people&#39;s take on south indian cuisine. Some things are too salty, other things are too bland, but at the very least, the room itself is gorgeous.

Got there early and had a couple of drinks at the bar. Cool bartender and good/quick drinks. It seemed more upscale from the outside, but it&#39;s definitely okay to dress casual--most people were.The lamb curry was nice, but not much different from others I&#39;ve had, but the chicken was excellent, as were the dosas and all else.Everything we had was good, atmosphere is nice, the place feels clean and everyone was very attentive and friendly. We&#39;ll go back for sure.

I am so pleased that this place opened up much closer to my house so I don&#39;t have to trek my ass down to the Mission. However, I had failed to eat here in all the months that it has been open because I am rarely over on that side of Van Ness; however, today I went for the Bliss package at the Kabuki Spa and continued the bliss with lunch and a cocktail at the bar!The space is beautiful, one would never suspect that it used to be a Goodwill! Though I did buy an awesome lamp here 10 years ago when it was one. It&#39;s modern and elegant but also has a lovely casual feel. The service, which I have always found hit and miss at the Mission location was spot on.I had the lunch special which was a &#34;mini-dosa&#34; (quotes because the thing was more than filling) and side salad special for $11. You get to choose your dosa or uttapam and one of their salad or soups so there are plenty of options. I went with paper masala dosa and a the greens with mango and goat cheese in a light vinagrette. Both were spot on and filling. I chased it all down with the Bengali Gimlet which was awesome and when I shared with the bartender that I was planning in Oscar party where everyone had to bring a cocktail based on one of the nominees and I was doing &#34;research&#34; for maybe doing a drink based on Slumdog Millionaire (or one of the three documentary shorts set in India!) he shared with me how they make their curried nectar;All and all a great experience and one I will definitely be repeating soon.

This is the best indian food in San Francisco! The restaurant is good for vegans and meat lovers - all are very welcome. The masala dosa is so good with coconut dip! I crave it all the time. They have a very interesting menu, organic salads, few kinds of seafood, brown rice, perfect for healthy eaters! We also got I think all the desserts from the menu - their dessert chef is very talented! The decor is beautiful, people are very nice, full bar... must try!

Let me start saying that I am a huge fan of Dosa Mission.But when I went to Dosa Fillmore the first there I wasn&#39;t disappointedat all. I loved it.The food is amazing as always, plus the full bar is a big plus.It&#39;s a great place for a lovely dinner or just a quick stop before goingto the Sundance.The decor is great and the acoustic is really good (better then Dosa Mission).Music in the background is always interesting and groovy.Service is also outstanding.

This one&#39;s going to be quick. Went to Dosa for friend&#39;s birthday. We all ordered the 35/person extra value meal four course thing and it was a mistake. We rec&#39;d very small dishes (they&#39;re half the normal size of a standard dish) and it felt like something silly. We could very easily have ordered a lot more food for the money and shared it amongst the table. In general the food tasted good. Calamari appetizer was especially good.The service was mediocre. I know, it&#39;s difficult to serve a large table, but hey, it&#39;s the big leagues. Let&#39;s go for it. While the downstairs was interesting and club-like the upstairs felt like the farm team. Nice people, but a bit overwhelmed. Again, group was large. By the end of the night, it was difficult enough for them to smile much less give good service.I&#39;d like to witness Dosa once more, but I&#39;m not likely to do it soon.

We ate so much here and all of it was great..Service was friendly and fairly fast. The place has great atmosphere.Had the blackened sardines which were perfectly flavored, and the crab cakes to start. Then we shared the potato dosa- very filling with good flavors. The masala whole fish was perfectly flavored and I understand the lamb was very good too.All this can be washed down with some unique spiced based cocktails- you have to try at least one..Were too full for dessert, so Im sure we&#39;ll be back.

Surprisingly filling meals in a spectacular location.Came into Dosa on a Monday night around 9pm, it was surprisingly full, which is always a good sign. The interior is amazing...the lights are well thought out and still maintains a classy feel.While the wine list is superb - the prices are a little on the high side. We ordered a bottle of the Cape Mentelle Shiraz for $52 - that&#39;s a hefty chunk of change.Started with the Chennai Chicken ($9.50) as an appetizer. It was very nice, bite sized chicken bits. Then had the Mysore Dosa ($10.50) which was decent, and a lot more filling than what it looks. Lastly had the Prawn Masala with coconut rice ($17) which we could barely get down because we were already so full. A little overpriced for the 6 or so prawns you get.Final bill for a table of two on Monday night was $114, half of which was a bottle of good wine - but still a place I would go to again.

Excellente!!!!!The food was delicious, and it came out really quickly.There are two parking garages close to the restaurant, so parking wasn&#39;t an issue.Only concern: If you plan on going out after dinner, reconsider the choice of cuisine. You will smell like Indian food once you leave the restaurant, and any alcoholic drinks with tonic may lead to unpleasant burps. But it&#39;s all fine if you plan to repel the opposite sex.By the way, this is suppose to be a positive review.I definitely recommend this restaurant.

The ambience was great and food was amazing.

I could taste every bit of spice in my first bite.I&#39;d suggest them to increase the choice in cocktails though.

Dosa is good and fun for a night out, but I am used to intimate curry restaurants where I know the chef and feel like I am eating a family recipe straight from India. This is definitely an SF take on curry, and the food is delicious, but it doesn&#39;t seem authentic. I&#39;d go back, but I&#39;m still in search of my favorite Indian restaurant in SF.

Our food was great. This restaurant is a lot of fun with a cozy environment. We went on Thursday night and had to wait approximately 45 minutes to get a table. I believe that you can make reservations, and I would advise to do just that. I am a vegetarian and there are plenty of vegi choices. We ate 2 dosa plates, and I had the vegi dish with chic peas; everything was very tasty! This South Indian food is a must, at least once if you live in SF. Finally, it is important to note that this is a pricey restaurant, not your typical Indian cuisine prices.

I had lunch yesterday for the first time with my friend. My friend from London is very familiar with Indian food, as there are so many Indian people and restaurants over there. She said some food (sauce and others) are a little different from the ones in London, but still the food at this place is pretty good. I ordered mini dosa &amp; salad on the lunch menu. You can pick one soup from 2 kinds or one salad from 2 kinds, and one dosa from several items. I picked mung salad and masala dosa. Not heavy and very healthy. I loved dosa, which is crispy outside and soft inside with right amount of salt. The filling (potatoes masala) was delicious, too. The service is great and the interior of the restaurant is beautiful.

The bartender is a B#$%^&amp; and the wait (even though we had a reservation) was 30 minutes.

I am always impressed with a restaurant that manages to serve spicy food while preserving the complexity and delicate balance of flavors in their dishes. In addition to a great menu, Dosa is also my favorite place for cocktails now. The skilled bartenders are great at combining exotic flavors and spices into drinks like you&#39;ve never had before. I even started to kind of look forward to the long wait because (if you&#39;re not famished) it is an excuse to hang at the bar and have 1 or 2 (or 3) delicious cocktails. The only note of caution is that you should plan your time accordingly even if you have a reservation because after 7:30 pm there always seems to be at least a 20 minute wait.

The reason for the 2 stars is due to the fact that my food was contaminated! When I go out to dinner, I do not expect to find plastic in my dish! I also do not expect the GM to bluntly brush that off, by telling that it&#39;s a garlic peel! Furthermore garlic peel is not 3 inches long, and may I also add that no restaurant pays a prep cook 10$ an hour to peel garlic! The server was also an A-hole! Instead of apologizing she made it seem like it was my fault that my dish was contaminated, ridiculous! The setting was OK nothing spectacular, and the food was So So I&#39;ve had better. Customer service is horrendous. I would not recommend that place.

Had a dosa + fish moilee. Fish was really really good - but it better be at $25 for a tiny portion of fish curry. Dosa was better than average, crispy on the outside but preparation was a little sub-ideal.So good; but portions are small, it&#39;s expensive and the Dosa&#39;s are good but not great.

The atmosphere is warm and inviting. (Note: Review is for brunch) Food is fresh (thank you for my Strauss yogurt)...Dosas are tasty. Although you pay a slight greater amount to say Udupi Palace - you are paying for a slight higher quality in ingredients as well as atmosphere. I liked how everything was generally spaced out and didn&#39;t have your typical SF crowded establishment, although this may not be as economical. Our server was friendly and food came out rather timely. I wasn&#39;t a big fan of my peas &amp; paneer dosa, but I felt it was more of the fault of mine vs. theirs. The skin of the dosa was perfectly crispy and flavorful. Note: The mango lassi is super thick and very filling.I&#39;ll be back....

What a disappointment!!!!!!I was so excited to have dinner at this restaurant for my birthday.The food is not good (I go out to good restaurants every week and I know what good food is) and the prices are a joke for what you get. We got the lamb brianni and there was 5 tiny pieces of lamb in a bowl of dry rice for I think $19!!!!!!!!!! the Dosas are so blah. The dessert was the worst part of the dinner. The rice pudding is awful. We sent it back and still got charged. I would never go back here so disappointed.

The new addition to the neighborhood is more upscale than Dosa #1 by far... but it was nice to see they kept the prices pretty comparable.We did have to wait 30 mins to get seated even though we had a reservation- but they comped us desert which makes me think they are trying...I&#39;ll go back when I want a nice night on the town... otherwise I might stick to the more low-key Mission version for a regular dinner spot.

YUMMY to my tummy! Great and fresh flavors that delighted my taste buds. We came here as a group of 14 and had to order from a pre-fixe menu. Although it was pre-fixe, the selections were still vast and we were able to share different dishes with each other. I recommend this place for big groups and birthday parties! Service is great and the food is fantastic. I especially love the Peony cocktail. It&#39;s got a great and unique taste. I am coming back, Dosa!!!

After all my friends and colleagues recommended me DOSA I finally went to DOSA at Fillmore. I was in the city at around 10:30PM and DOSA at this location is the one that was open until 12:00AM during the weekends which the first thing that I liked about DOSA. Not a lot of restaurants are open until this late.Once I entered DOSA I loved the ambience of the restaurant. the look with dimmed lights gave a very trendy yet very cozy look to the place. Coming to the food we ordered Rava Dosa, Roasted Chile &amp; Garlic Masala Dosa, Nilgiri Chicken korma and Golden Trout Baked w/ Cilantro-Chile Chutney. With all 4 dishes we have ordered the presentation gets very high point to start with and the taste gets much higher points. All the 4 dishes were simply superb and especially the trout, is to die for.Once we were done with the main course we wanted to try some deserts and we ordered Rasmalai. I was so surprised on how tasty it was. I have eaten Rasmalai a zillion times in India and in US and never tasted one as I tasted in Dosa. It was soo fresh and tasty and just melts in my mouth.Hands down the best Indian restaurant that I visited in United States. So I would definitely recommend this restaurant to everyone.

This place looks nice but the food is just mediocre. Our waitress was kinda of condescending to my boyfriend. Maybe I&#39;m not used to eating southern indian food but it jsut tasted blah. we orderd the jumbo prawn masala with cocount rice. the rice is so cocunutty i thought it would be just a hint of it. it comes in a heaping bowl too big for a person to eat! also got the masala dosa. I really like that sauce that comes with it but i wouldn&#39;t get this dish again and also the lamb curry was lacking so much flavor. I guess that&#39;s what you get from such a commecial looking place.I don&#39;t understand the service of this place either. my bf brought me a birthday cake to the restaurant and it takes them forever to bring it out then when she finally comes out with it theres no forks or plates and then she asks if I want it cut. Well duh...at least she put a candle on my cake.

This place is nasty! I love indian food but this establishment is a sad excuse for one. They use the same spice and flavoring for a lot of the dishes. I ordered the palak dosa and also the samosas. They samosas were over fried and the oil tasted old. They were dripping in it. Then the dosa came and the lentils etc on the side to dip in were less than appealing. The dosa itself didnt even have melted cheese in it. Needless to say I felt very sick upon leaving this location and also when I got home, certainly had traces of food poisioning as I was vomiting all night. Save yourself the aftermath, and the money, and go somewhere else!

my girl friend and i had a &#34;date&#34; here friday night. we arrived early so we decided to grab a drink at the bar.i had the Emerald Sound and she had the Bengali Gimlet. my drink was good. reminded me of a mojito but better cuz it&#39;s with whiskey. one drink was pretty strong (maybe i&#39;m just a lightweight).before we knew it, our table was ready. we were hungry. we had our eye on 4 dishes... 1 starter, 2 dosas, and 1 masala. luckily our waitress told us it was way too much food for the 2 of us girls and she was right!overall the food was really good... very bold flavors. the only thing that would stop me from going back is that it&#39;s a bit on the pricey side. but i think that&#39;s due to the fact that i&#39;m unemployed right now. so once i&#39;m fully employed, i&#39;d come back with no hesitation.

We had dinner here and it was off the hook!The restaurant is really big and the decor is awesome...the chandeliers are Chihuli-esque and there is a big Shiva statue in the center. Me and my three ladies got a table by the window. The seats were so comfortable (huge for me). The menu is very overwhelming but the waitress was very helpful and attentive, really great service overall.And now for the best part...the food...it&#39;s different than the Indian food we are used to eating. My friend traveled around south east asia so she told us a lot about the food and that was cool.The presentation was spectacular and made us ooooh and aaahhhh...one of the breads was big and puffy, one was so long it took up the whole table..it was just this extravaganza of sights and flavorsThey all got different cocktails which I of course tasted and didn&#39;t like any of them. I got a mango lassi and it was epicly delicious.Then came the calamari appetizer...it was SO good! The spicyish sauce it came in was delish....

GOOD FOR GROUPS and sharing. Right as you walk into Dosa on a Friday night, you know that you will have a good dinner. The atmosphere and ambiance is really cool. It has very open feel but not empty. Great Service and help from the waiters.The food is different from most Indian Restaurants. Dosa&#39;s are big crepes with Indian Ingredients. Great for Vegetarians.I would recommend getting the Chennai Chicken as a starter, Dahi Vada, and a Spicy Mung Masala Dosa. They were all very tasty and different.Went in to DOSA the other night with 2 friends and we split a masala dosa before going to a movie. It was very convenient and we sat at the bar so they didn&#39;t mind the fact that we didn&#39;t order much.

I loved this restaurant! Before this, I seriously was NOT a fan of Indian food at all. I only liked Samosas and only Samosas. I hated most Indian curries in the past because they all looked very unappetizing. But after my experience at Dosa today, my feelings about Indian food has definitely changed! I ordered a Batsman cocktail and it was very refreshing and tasty. The Behl Puri salad was good too. We also ordered the Goan Prawn Balchao, Chicken Korma, Samosas, and the Masala Dosa. The Prawns stood out for me the most, very juicy and fresh! Absolutely loved it. I officially love Indian food!! and... what I loved even more was the ambience of this place and the presentation of the food! made the experience even better!

Yummy yummy South Indian food! It&#39;s also the best place for gluten-free. I like to get the paneer dosa and the dahi vada. The fillmore location is larger than the mission location so it&#39;s great for groups or a bite to eat before or after a movie at the Kabuki. The wine list is A-mazing-- the staff knows it pretty well too. I&#39;ve been here many a time and it&#39;s hard to hit up a place more than once in SF with all the great restaurants. A definite must try!

I thoroughly enjoyed Dosa. I&#39;m no expert on Indian food but I quite enjoyed both the appetizers (can&#39;t remember what we got) and my main course of masala dosa. Reasonable wine selection. Beautiful restaurant. Fun environment. Great walking distance from downtown (about one mile). Block away from The Fillmore. Highly recommend.

The best dosas I&#39;ve had in a restaurant in US. We tried egg dosa, masala dosa, onion rava and rava masala dosa. All of them were excellent. The potato masala was done well &amp; cocunut chutney and sambhar were also good. But I still miss mom made dosas!

Gosh I love this place. It&#39;s definitely some of the best Indian food that&#39;s ever hit my lips and I love the stuff. The only thing negative to say is that I eat with my eyes and not with my stomach. All the entrees and dosa portions are generous can easily be split among a couple of diners. My current crushes are the fennel dosa and the veggie curry. Delish!

This place has an amazing atmosphere, the food blew me away! In fact it was so good, I had to return for a quick lunch before I left town, after having it the night before for dinner.I recommend any of the dhosas, and if you want it to be spicy ask the wait staff for the chef to crank it up, I assure you he/she does deliver. I noticed a lot of the other diners ordered the lassi, but I never actually tried some but I think giving it a whirl won&#39;t be a bad idea, it is a very popular drink.The chicken frankie was delightful, bit oily, but eh, you&#39;re out to eat, indulge your self a little. The spicy garlic dosa was what my girlfriend order, and we almost got into tiff cause I couldn&#39;t stop myself from having some of her food. It was on point, I wish they had given more sambar (warm sauce they give with the dosa) though.Overall scout report - If you love South Indian food, you have to try this place when in San Francisco.

I went to DOSA for dinner with a group of gals. Our first impression was that the ambience rocks! We got seated and as we reviewed the menu we got super excited about what was ahead of us. We all decided to do the tasting menu which was a great idea. The food was fresh, spicy and full of flavor. Only downside to this place has no privacy. Tables are crammed next to each other. As a matter of fact when I went to the bathroom I bumped the table next to me with my butt and I am not that big. I think this is a great place to go for a special occasion with lots of people but not a place to go if you are on a date and looking for romance. I would highly recommend going to the bar and checking out the cool surroundings.

I should have known something horrid would happen when I had to call 6 times to get a reservation for my group.By the time we got seated, I was so stressed I don&#39;t even recall WHAT I ate, let along what I ordered. My guests tell me that theordered/ received correctly ratio was 0. It all tasted ok, but....I&#39;m sure it&#39;s all fine for parties of 2, but NEVER book for an event.

i finally got the opportunity to dine here and it was a fun double date! although we had pretty late reservations (8:45pm on a friday), we still had to wait another 15 min or so before we were seated. this place is packed and def much larger and nicer ambiance than the mission location. we shared the dahi vada starter (lentil dumplings, topped with cool strauss organic yogurt, piped with tamarind &amp; mint, mildly spiced), 2 types of dosas (masala and spicy mung), 2 south indian entrees (lamb curry and mango jumbo prawns), and the spring uttapam. my favorites were the veggie uttapam and dahi vada appetizer. the dosas were also tasty but i&#39;m not much of a potato girl.worth checking out but i may just stick to udupi palace for the raw deal.

Tried out their Dine About Town 2009 lunch menu. Food was okay but service was TERRIBLE! Reservation was at 12:15 and we were seated promptly. My friend and I didn&#39;t order until 12:35. Mind you, I had to ask the bus boy to tell him that we were ready to order, as it wasn&#39;t his job.Here is a breakdown of courses between myself and my friend:First course - coconut soup and chopped saladSecond course - chutney masala dosa and cilantro/coconut fishThird course - sweet pongal and coconut sorbetThe dishes were ok, as I&#39;ve had better Indian cuisine. The coconut soup was very light but almost watery. The chopped salad was merely something you could do yourself. After the our first course, we waited (and I&#39;m not joking) 40 minutes for our second course. Were they trying to kill the chicken? The wait was absurd! We weren&#39;t the only ones who had to wait on our dishes. I noticed that our neighbor kept on asking their waiter about the status of their dish.40 minutes later, our last course came, before our second! I snapped and said, &#34;We didn&#39;t even receive our second course!&#34; He apologized and quickly came with our second course. The chutney masala dosa was okay. There was an abundance of potato. If you&#39;re a vegetarian, then this is the dish for you. I&#39;m a meat eater so I was disappointed with this. However, the chutney was okay. The cilantro and coconut fish was excellent. Yes, the restaurant receives a point for their fish as it was very moist and flaky.Our last course came literally 2 minutes after our waiter cleared our second course. I sarcastically said, &#34;Wow, I didn&#39;t even have to wait for my dessert!&#34; The rice pudding was okay... something I personally would never order again. The thought of roasted lentils and sweet rice does not make a great pairing. On the other hand, my friend had the coconut sorbet WITH saffron threads. I was surprised with the saffron threads as it is an expensive spice. It tasted interesting along with the sorbet. Our neighbor who also had the sorbet, didn&#39;t have saffron threads. We spoke to them and they agreed that service was very lousy. They were foodies so they know their culinary stuff. I told her to get the saffron threads so she could get her monies worth since my friend had saffron threads sprinkled on her sorbet.Our bill came and the total for two footed to be $49, without tip. With outstandingly TERRIBLE service, I did not hesitate to leave any tip. $0 tip for lousy service and we just walked out.In essence, the restaurant is overrated and you can get awesome Indian food else where. Extremely terrible service. They pay no attention to their customers. Nothing memorable, except for me not leaving a tip. I don&#39;t recommend this restaurant at all.

I was initially intrigued by this restaurant when I passed by it a few months ago. The interior looked so nice and the menu was equally appealing, so I decided it would be the perfect place for Valentines day dinner...and I was right! It was amazing! Our server was incredibly sweet and knowledgeable and the food was SO good! We ordered the tasting menu (I think that&#39;s what it&#39;s called?) and it was well worth it because you get to try a bit of everything! Be warned though...you&#39;ll get STUFFED! Lots of vegan options, as should be expected from and Indian restaurant. The atmosphere was just lovely and the price was not bad at all! I was expecting to pay a lot more! Can&#39;t wait to come back!

Went here at 3:04 pm on the day after Thanksgiving with two hungry kids. Was told that the kitchen was shut at 3 pm - literally few minutes earlier and shown the door. Hardly the hospitality one would expect. Their attitude definitely sucks - no matter how good their food may have been , why would anyone want to go to restaurant where the people are clueless about hospitality?

The drinks are amazing, which certainly takes the edge off of the always long wait. An awesome gluten free find, as all of the dosas but two are gluten free (and vegetarian, too)! Perfect portions, and the dipping sauces are so good, I&#39;d like to bathe in them.

Loved our dinner tonight. The food was excellent and so was the atmosphere. We had the spring dosa, masala uttapam, and 2 of their curries. Soy chai was quite yummy. The dessert menu needs some work. One was the tapioca and i forgot what the other was called...Would have enjoyed it more had we not been so rushed by the waiter. Plates were taken away quickly, even with that last piece of the dosa.

I really like Dosa. I&#39;ve been to both. The one in Fillmore is more than twice the size. It is not as cramped so you can go with more people or take food adventurous kids or a baby. The dosas are all wonderful. I love the spring and masala (the regular and the paper masala). Also tried the spinach and leek, which was very good. Yummy fun to dip the dosas in their delicious sauces and lentil soup. Yummy. The curries are also good. The lemon and coconut rice are both delicious. The chicken byrani is good. All of it is good for sharing and experiencing with others so go with at least two others. Oh and my favorite is the dahi vada starter...lentil cake thingys covered in yogurt sauce! That is delicious. The persimmons salad also yum. Pretty much everything is YUMMY.Good wine selection and interesting beers. I&#39;ve never had the desserts, because I am always stuffed after dinner. Service is good. The server we had last time tried to discourage us a couple of times from ordering just dosas, which was a bit annoying, but I think she was just trying to upsell and get us to all order mains along with dosas. Supposedly they are known for their mains, but I enjoy the dosas more. Especially if you are veg, you can&#39;t go wrong with the dosas. The best thing to do is go with others and try it all!

what a beautiful space!!! the owners deserve ALL the accolades. the food, the drinks, the atmosphere, ALL make this one of the hottest restaurants in the city.my first bite into the habenero-mango dosa brought back high school memories for me. literally, every single bite had me going ohh &amp; ahh...loved it! the fish moilee was another great dish. the flavors were all so delicious. the coconut, the mustard &amp; spices blended in very well. a must order if you love fish (as someone mentioned, the coconut rice which accompanies this entree can certainly be eaten as a dessert, lol.)i&#39;m a big fan of borscht, so it was a good treat to start w/ beet soup here at Dosa. it was creamy, and done well. to finish off, settled with rasmalai, which is basically cheese patties in cream, flavored w/ rose water &amp; garnished w/ pistachios. this one was ok. it&#39;s one of the hardest desserts to make, cooks master this one back home. there have been only 3 places i have had fabulous rasmalai, and none are here in the U.S. having said that, this is the best rasmalai in SF.i also had two drinks recommended by our lovely bartender, Suzanne. the first was a cocktail -the Bengali Gimlet. the curry flavor made it interesting, but it was a little too sweet for me, and i would go easy on the lime juice next time. or simply, gimlet for me, has to be made w/ vodka! the second was a glass of Riesling. which was well chosen by our bartender, and generally the best wine to go w/ indian food. it was perfect!(as a disclosure, i&#39;m in the restaurant business &amp; have a couple of indian restaurants myself here in the city. i have to say Dosa is by far one of the best in the business -i.e. after my two restaurants :) )

After eating at two &#34;high end&#34; Indian restaurants in the last few weeks (the other being Amber India) I was surprised at how differently I felt about the two. Both were beautiful restaurants with great service but I really felt like Dosa was trying too hard. It was like it was trying to be pretentious to attract the Pac Heights/Marina crowd who wouldn&#39;t venture to the original (and better) location in the Mission. Sad. I also felt weird that we were eating in the old Good Will location. It was just a weird juxtaposition.That being said, I do feel the food has suffered with the expansion. I remember eating at the original years ago and enjoying it much more. I&#39;ve eaten at Udupi palace recently and have to say their dosa is better. Actually I prefer the uttapam which isn&#39;t as well known as the dosa but is like a thicker, savory pancake. Anyway, the new restaurant is pretty nice but it kind of lacks some heart in my opinion. The food was good but not as complex in flavor, the overwhelming impression I got was spicy without all the wonderful flavors I normally taste in Indian food. Overall I left Dosa feeling like I was wanting more.

This place is great!! Its very posh inside...the decor is very nice and the food is delicious! Everything is full of flavor! mmm! I would suggest calling in ahead of time for a reservation because they are always packed. I would really recommend the Chennai Chicken -- Boneless organic chicken marinated in Strauss organic yogurt with coriander &amp; cumin, fried. It&#39;s a little spicey but its really delicious! The Cochin Calamari is also a great appetizer as well. The Masala Dosa ...it&#39;s the classic dosa filled with creamy spiced potatoes, onions, and cashew nuts (masala). They also carry a variety of Indian beers and a great variety of good wines that really do go great with the food at Dosa.

I wish that I could give separate ratings for food and for service. I would give four stars for the food and two for the service.Last night was my first time there. I have heard many great things about the restaurant and was looking forward to the dinner.The experience started out alright with the server helping us choose numerous dishes that we planned to share.The dishes came out in a logical and timely fashion. It was in the clearing of them that things started to break down. The servers and bussers were overly anxious to get dishes cleared. Several times they took things away before we were finished with them. Annoying and, quite frankly, amateur.Things really got janky at the end. After we paid the bill the server made continuous intrusive sweeps through the table clearing things. Again, many of which we weren&#39;t finished with. Water, for example. The kicker was when the server took my wife&#39;s glass of wine with wine still in it!On top of that, as she cleared our glassware she stuck her fingers down inside the glass so that she could get two or three at a time. That&#39;s just plain damn gross! She stuck her fingers down into our dirty glasses and then just kept on serving food.A good start and a crappy finish. Definitely not up to the standards of our stellar restaurant culture here in San Francisco.

I was looking to use the dine about town menu, but the waiter said &#34;it doesn&#39;t start till the 15th (it was the 16th) and confused me, then I double checked the next time he came and he apologizes and said he meant Monday (19th). that&#39;s fine. but why would they ignore the start date od dine about town, and just decide to do it later? weird... to make up for it, he did give us complimentary cardamom ice cream! good effort.The sambar is a huge serving. the chutney is good. there&#39;s a LOT of potato, be prepared!However, my mom says says home town (San Diego) South Indian restaurants do it better!nice ambiance tho

Fantastic South Indian food. For those who are not familiar with the difference between South Indian and North Indian food, which may explain reviews of this restaurant for not being &#34;authentic&#34;, they are about as different as New England vs. Southern American cuisine. North Indian is what you tend to get in almost all Indian restaurants. It is heavy on cream and butter. Southern Indian tends to be much lighter, heavy on spices, sometimes quite hot, with one of the traditional dishes being the Dosa. The Dosa is a paper thin crepe made out of rice and lentils which is then stuffed with various vegetables. Our favorite is the Masala Dosa, which is the potato and onion Dosa. You then have three sauces to dip it in (read: control the spiciness level). We eat here all the time, have gone through almost the entire menu, and have never had anything that wasn&#39;t good. Some of our favorites: their fire broth, a super spicy tomato broth, chenna chicken, chickpee curry, and the masala dosa. Their wine list is excellent, seriously, and very unique.The negative: they don&#39;t take reservations for parties of four or less. And this is new, we have gone there with over six and they wouldn&#39;t take a reservation. The place is PACKED, particularly on the weekends, which means you end up waiting for over an hour at the bar. Oh, and the place is very noisy - bad acoustics. It&#39;s also not cheap. This is NOT your neighborhood curry house - but it is worth every cent.As for not being &#34;authentic&#34; we just left the place this evening and at the line to pay for the parking ticket we ran into one of my husband&#39;s coworkers, a South Indian man. His family was visiting from Southern India and wanting to take them to the best Southern Indian restaurant in San Francisco he took them to Dosa. They loved it!

I went there after having read many reviews on yelp. It was my last evening in SF so I wanted something special in terms of food and of place. and I was delighted by both. This is not the Indian at the round corner, this is a real nice place with a nice trendy decoration where you can go for a special diner with someone or with a group of friends. The staff knew that it was a special moment cause I said it during my reservation and they give us a really nice table on the mezanine with a perfect view on the the huge dining room downstairs. Highly recommended!We ate the south indian lamb kefta as recommended by a native indian on yelp and it was delicious. I will highly recommend it! if you like spicy food, you will be served (not too spicy but at least a bit).And for the desert, our first thought was to only take the gulab jamoon but the wise waiter highly recommend us trying also the rasmalai ... and guess what? It has been such a long time that I haven&#39;t been astonished by deserts!!! you have to try it, honestly it is so tasty, such a greed must be eaten! and be sure that I am really picky about desert.The service was great, not asking every 5 mn if everything was OK but respecting our privacy! An excellent service and staff!Two minor negative points: 1) a bit disappointed by their rum cocktails (ginger ante: too bitter so not really emphasizing the quality of the rum according to me and caipirhina: not that great ), however the wine was good. 2) the ceiling should be decorated to hide its white and impersonal color which works again its warm ambiance given by the deco, maybe some both dark red and orange curtains....

If you love DOSA on Valencia, then DOSA on Fillmore will blow you away! The food at both restaurants are uniform in taste and presentation. I did notice one new dosa on the menu that I had not seen at Valencia, which could have been updated, and the habanero mango masala dosa created some beads of forehead sweat! We also ordered the regular masala dosa and an uttapam. Same sambar and dipping sauces. The bhel puri is a blend of bhel and sev puri, as usual with the sweet brown and mint chutneys. For the first time I tried a curry at dosa, and the lamb curry is an absolute knock out, perfect to share for three people. That dish will now be my staple order at this restaurant. The wines still serve as great pairings with the fragrant dishes. And there are some new cocktails with plenty of Indian spice flair.Lastly, everyone notices the decor. The amazing chandelier train vividly points out the high ceilings which makes for a spacious and classy restaurant. Valencia is more on the casual side as most people with parties less than 6 are walk-ins, and the bar is always jammed pack. The Fillmore location, takes RESERVATIONS onOpenTable.comfor parties of all sizes. Without reservations, slum it at the roomy long bar! If you are luckier, score an immediate spot at the long communal table that may seat about 15, but it is quite tight. There is definitely plenty of eye contact and eyelash batting at this communal table. * wink * wink * If you are a people-watcher and conversation-listener like me, topics around this narrow stretch of wood can be quite...interesting, to say the least. For example we were debating the merits and credibility of YELP *ahem* and the waitstaff happened to pass by and over hear with a smirk on her face. I cringed hoping that the rest of the evening would not involve a swift kick to the butt and boot out of there. Needless to say, it was a great dining experience.Parking can be quite difficult in Pacific Heights proper, but the location is a few blocks further, across from Japantown. I found free street parking after circling thrice around the block for a peak 7PM Sunday dinner. If I were to circle once more, I was more than willing to drop off my guest and head over to the Japantown parking garage. My convenience balance sides with Fillmore.

Really enjoy my meals at DOSA. Great food, good ambiance. Haven&#39;t had to wait too long to be seated (although 10 minutes or so is the norm, even with a reservation). The tasting menu is the way to go, and gives a great overview of what DOSA has to offer, from appetizers to entrees, desserts, etc. It&#39;s a bit pricey, but what isn&#39;t in SF? Overall, a very enjoyable meal.

I didn&#39;t know what to expect heading into this experience since I am not a huge fan of Indian food. However, with all of the raving reviews I was intrigued to see what it was all about. Such a neat place with an impressive decor. I really enjoyed brunch here. My table split the Seasonal Fruit Napoleon Uttapam and the apple pieces added a distinct flavor to the dish. A strawberry puree also accompanied the dish nicely. For my main entree I opted for the Egg Dosa with cheese. There was too much cheese for me and if I went back I would probably choose no cheese, but regardless, it was still tasty. Service was good, we were provided a few recommendations and the server was very friendly. I definitely want to go back and explore the dinner menu.

I went a couple of weeks ago for brunch with the girls. The food was ok, the thai tea was different and I would have appreciated a tip on how it is supposed to be enjoyed &#34;properly&#34;. I ordered the Seasonal Fruit Napolean and it was ok. I don&#39;t know much about Indian Food, but it did not leave a lasting impression. I would go again if invited, but would not initiate it as a place I need to try again.

Service wasn&#39;t great. Food was really good though. Calamari and Chicken for apps, and the halibut, marsala dosa, and uthappam sampler. Drinks were very interesting, with some real different flavors, but were good. 3 stars because of the service, 4 stars on food alone. There&#39;s a 10 dollar all you can eat indian buffet 3 doors down, I tempted to try that one.

Spectacular! First off, the space, decor and ambiance of the new Dosa is amazing. It makes going out to dinner feel like a night out on the town but not in an obnoxious way. It is sleek and sexy. The bar area is spacious and happening and you can still keep tabs on what is going on from the dining room area. I went with my good friend Liz, who knows the owners and a two other girls. We had delicious mung bean dosa filled with warm, spicy potatoes and served with a cool cucumber raita, the ultimate comfort food. We also shared the spicy prawn appetizer, lamb curry with the most aromatic lemon-basmati rice, and an extremely tender chicken dish. Many times Indian food can be too heavy, not the case here. The food is spiced perfectly and it tastes so fresh. Thank you Anjan and Emily for a great evening and treating us so well. I am already planning my next visit!

Beautiful place!! Love those chandeliers and lights!Since I am not a big connoisseur of Indian food, I will give it 4 stars: presentation, ambiance, service and great tasting food.The drinks are excellent, have some zing to it ( I mean, enough booze!) and very exotic. We chose the set menu, four courses for 40, and tried a few different items. All tasted very good. Have to say Indian food is not something I would eat every day though. Have to get used to it. And I like this cuisine better than The cuisine at Amber...Service was excellent, always checking on how we were doing, if we needed more drinks. By 8PM, the place was completely full, the waiter got busy, so we had to wait a bit ... But overall, a great experience.

We&#39;ve been to Dosa twice. Each time we&#39;ve been seated near the busing station at the back of the restaurant, where it is breezy and cold; we wore our coats throughout our dinner. I&#39;d like to deduct half a star for this.That said, the food at Dosa is delicious. We always leave stuffed to the gills with food. You can come out relatively cheaply if you can avoid drinks and appetizers. The restaurant itself is pretty swank and apparently always busy.I definitely recommend this restaurant, but dress warmly or you&#39;ll freeze.

For those of you who are not familiar with south Indian food, this is a really good place to start. South Indian food, unlike food from the northern part of the country tends to not be cream based (yeah for you lactose intolerant people!). I would recommend most things at Dosa, but for you new comers this is not your chicken tikka marsala place you think of with Indian food. The dosa are basically huge crepes that they roll up and give you with spiced potatoes and some curry and chutneys to either dip it in or to wrap up in it (you&#39;re choice!). The uttapam are what I imagine would happen if a pancake and a hashbrown had a baby - and you also get some dipping sauces and curry with them. Personally I love the paneer (mild Indian cheese) and pea uttapam. Try this place out, it&#39;s a great introduction to a &#34;new&#34; type of Indian food for most people!

A prosecco is a sparkling wine, but the one I ordered lacked any &#34;bubbles&#34; which meant it had been opened a while back and should not be served. The prosecco was completely &#34;still like a wine&#34; so I related this to the waiter. He came back with a tiny sample of prosecco in another glass, this time with bubbles and insisted both were from the same bottle. I drink prosecco frequently and travel to Italy annually. I declined the drink, rather than argue over the matter.The food is unremarkable; I feel it is overrated. Needless to say, I would not recommend this place.

OMG. I am a south indian and I hail from the place were dosas and sambar were first made. This is the food I used to eat daily at home in India. I cannot believe how authentic the food was here! My husband and friends (all from s. india as well) were bowled over by the taste and richness of flavor. Trust me, this is as authentic as it gets! I felt like i was back home, eating my mom&#39;s food. yummm...I have been to the old dosa as well as this one several times. The food&#39;s awesome, service is good..what can I say..I love this place.Everything tastes good here, ofcourse, but we really enjoyed the different varieties of dosas and coconut rice.But it is almost always crowded and the waiting time can get really long. It is best to call ahead and make a reservation.

We went again for dinner (rather than lunch like the previous time), and while everything was still good, the food was just not quite as savory as the first time. Inconsistency? It was enough to make me rethink laying down a fat wad of cash for food that didn&#39;t live up to my memory of it. Perhaps (when someone else is paying) i&#39;ll give it another shot, but I prefer to return to certain 5-star places only. After all, I don&#39;t think I could ever run out of places to try in the Fillmore area.

You pay for the environment not really the food. Came here for the first time yesterday for Dine About Town and ordered the 3-course menu with the wine flight. 2 of the 3 courses were good, and 1 of the 3 wines was good. The atmosphere is cool. There are all sorts of people: business professionals, yoga students, friend groups, family groups, cute couples on dates, shoppers eating solo, etc...There is also nice music and a lot of attention (service), though it felt a little rushed for one that really likes to &#39;dine.&#39; Basically, the food didn&#39;t deliver too much on taste, just presentation. If you are coming here for authentic Indian food look elsewhere. If you are coming for a chill place to grab pricey food then you will be content.

What a great space, high ceilings that go up past the second floor dining room. Big bar, large dining space and a communal table, too. All in all, a very grand feel, quite different for the small cosier space of the restaurant&#39;s Mission location. Now on to the food - Very good, well presented, clean and fresh... a little on the pricey side. The samosas were great, as was the goat curry with lemon rice. But the star was the masala dosa. So delicious, I need to go back and try their other dosas. And very large and filling too.Beers are a bit high priced for what they are (a sierra for $6?), but you are paying for the space and the atmosphere, I guess...And the music was club-y the night we went... I hope it&#39;s not like that all the time...I would probably just opt for their other location next time. Equally delicious food without the club atmosphere...Still a very good overall dining experience.

I never thought an Indian restaurant could ever look THAT beautiful...the chandeliers took my breath away. Granted there was little that was actually strikingly Indian about the whole decor, but it was a nice modern take. I just wish there were more Indian paintings of culture, besides that one huge picture at the back left.The dosa itself was like anything else I could find in any other South Indian restaurant back in Southern California, so the food did not disappoint me. The taste of the chutneys are considerably milder, however, but it caters to the crowd that comes here and that does not mind paying more than they actually should for South Indian food.But I gotta say, although South Indian food is normally not the most expensive of all cuisines, the price was fitting for the beautiful atmosphere and the experience. In fact, I am surprised that with such a classy-looking restaurant, it wasn&#39;t even MORE expensive! But I don&#39;t want to place ideas in the owners&#39; heads now...I would come back for the new twists they take on traditional Indian food that make it gourmet. I would also come back for the bar and the atmosphere if I wanted to show it off to some friends or a date. But for completely traditional South Indian food, I would go to the ones in LA that serve the same tasty dishes for even cheaper. But the one thing this place has accomplished that no other Indian restaurant has (and I am saying this as a &#34;North&#34; Indian) is that it finally places South Indian food on the map. No more naan, k? For that, I give it 5 stars. BRAVO!

Dosa&#39;s impressive size makes a statement as much as its menu. If you&#39;re gonna reshape a former Goodwill into a restaurant, this is the way to do it. The atmosphere is comforting and the service attentive. The food: delicious. We started with the chopped salad, the samosas and the dumplings in yogurt. The salad was refreshing and the dumplings and samosas were perfect companions. Next we had the masala dosa and baingan bharta. The chutney&#39;s accompanying the dosa were beyond comparison. Another plus is their wine list, which is well-paired with the menu. My only gripe is they were out of Kingfisher. Really?

The food quality is very consistent with its sister location in the Mission. The one big difference is the ambiance of this location, which is far more modern and trendy. I can see myself hitting this trendier looking location for some cocktails after work.

Think &#34;Madras Cafe&#34; with a great ambiance and that&#39;s Dosa on Fillmore. The look-n-feel of the place was quite impressive and for a moment we had to double check if we had entered a wrong restaurant (if you visited any of the Indian restaurants in the South Bay, you&#39;ll understand what I&#39;m talking about where the focus is solely on the food and very little on the aesthetics). The menu was typical South Indian --- it had dosa and curd rice among other things : - ). We had the masala dosa, which was decent. It actually looked more like a wrap of some sort than a traditional dosa. The sambar and chutneys were okay. The best part was that it was open quite late and we went there at around midnight after attending a show in Oakland. This place is good for a one-time visit - no regrets.

I had dinner here with a few friends and the place is beuatiful - open and bright with a great ambience. The food was not a disappointment either. It was alittle different that some of the Indian food that I have experienced in the past - but I&#39;m Italian, so what do I know? All I know is what tastes good and this place def. does. I loved the dosa&#39;s (it was my first time eating them) - here are so many to choose from. I also introduced my table to Paratha and Raita - which were both excellent here. The lamb chops (app) were equally yummy - juicy tender and tasty. Yum. This place is worth the trip - excellent for a group of friends or a great date night. OH! I also forgot the drink menu! I am slipping in my old age :-) IThe menu is full of fun creative cocktails that are STRONG. I downed a couple &#34;Bollywood Hills&#34; - hmmm...maybe that&#39;s why the food tasted so good...

What not to miss? Laura F. and I dig that red beet cumin soup and just tried the garbanzo and avocado salad for the first time last month and it was really light--but still filling--just the type of combination I&#39;m looking for. Added bonus? Last time I was there the people watching was fab, think: furrys and sailors.

If you have food sensitivities, Dosa is your friend. I&#39;m gluten and dairy-free and eating out is tough. Not to mention eating great food can be tough. We went here for my birthday, and my husband noted that I was GF and DF when making the reservation. They discreetly included a special menu listing everything they had on the current menu and whether or not it had gluten or dairy, or nuts...It was so helpful and I didn&#39;t have to feel high-maintenance and ask what I could eat. It was so nice. Our server, Kelly was so nice too. Every dish was delicious. We never felt rushed and the space was big and roomy but never too loud. Loved it! Will definitely go back for more.

I can&#39;t get over how much I LOVE the lemon rice. Unfortunately, I&#39;m not that big of fan of the dosa&#39;s but I think it&#39;s more of a preference thing. What I absolutely enjoyed were the entree dishes--cilantro and chile fish, curry lamb, and peppercorn chicken. Service was friendly but not that attentive; we had to ask for plate change and the wine list after we finished our glasses but our server did look really busy. Decor is gorgeous. Beautiful art work all over. Very different vibe from Dosa&#39;s in the Mission District, Dosa on Fillmore definitely is more modern but maintains the same delicious food.

This is a great date place. The ambiance is very nice. I took a first date here and we both had a great time. I had read the reviews about the place being loud, so when I made a reservation I asked about it. The lady was very accomodating, saying they had some tables that were quieter than others and that she would us there. The table was great, right in front of the windows, and while there was one occassion where it got difficult to hear, overall it wasn&#39;t too bad. The overall ambiance more than made up for it. The service overall was phenomenal, and the food was very good. We did the price fixe for 4 courses, which was plenty enough food for us even though it is smaller portions. The service was amazing. They continuously filled our glasses with water and checked in on us, and we were there for over 2 1/2 hours during peak time without feeling rushed in the least.The music in the background is top 40ish which seems odd for the ambiance. We noticed it and it made us chuckle.Parking is a challenge! I looked for over 20 minutes while my date waited inside. Valet would definitely make this place better. I couldn&#39;t even find a garage, so locate one ahead of time. Even with the parking, the experience was worth the trouble.

I have been here twice. The first time, I went with someone who lived in India for eleven years, she said that it was pretty authentic. We went again a couple of nights ago and had the veggie dosa and a chicken curry. I personally thing that everything is a little too salty and pretty spicy. It was pretty good while we were eating but later we both had tummy aches. Not good! So a mixed review on this one. Convient location and decent food but made me sick!

Our server (I&#39;ll call her &#34;A&#34;) was warm and friendly and really seemed confident in her menu knowledge. She was great in guiding us as far as how much to order. We started with these delicious crab cakes and the duo of Samosas. Yum. The habenero sauce was a bit (no wait, way too) spicy. Egads. Then we shared the lamb curry with lemon rice and the spring dosa. I LOVED the spring dosa. It was fantastic. The lamb curry was good, but too spicy for me. At some point during the dinner Server A let us know that Server B was going to take over. Server B, barely checked in on us. When someone else walked by to see how things were we told them that the lamb curry was a bit spicy. They offered some yogurt raita to cool it down. How nice! What wasn&#39;t nice was they neglected to tell us it was $4.50 for that. I don&#39;t care if it Strauss or whatever. It&#39;s yogurt. A small side isn&#39;t worth $4.50.We opted to skip dessert, so no comment. Nothing looked that appetizing.In the end, I liked the food but the service was a bit all over the place. I can&#39;t say if I&#39;ll be back or not.

After I came back from India my friends really wanted me to try out this restaurant and tell them whether I thought it was authentic, because they had fallen in love with it. We waited FOREVER to get a table (like 1.5 hours), drinking Kingfisher at the bar (authentic), and by the time we were seated, it was totally worth the wait. We ordered a masala dosa, the Indian crispy &#34;crepe&#34; with spiced potatoes inside, and a curry that was divine with the perfect mix of spice and buttery creamy goodness. The dosa was very similar to what you would get at Chutney&#39;s in Hyderabad (minus the banana leaf serving platter), and this restaurant did a good job of South Indian in a more upscale atmosphere. I would definitely recommend this to any Indian food-lovers in the city who haven&#39;t already tried it.

the food was good. i ordered the veggie curry. all of my friends ordered dosa. all the flavors were yummy. but nothing to brag about. although i did love the chips they give you.the service sucked! our waiter didn&#39;t even tell us his name or smile once. it took him forever to take our order, we finished our appetizers before we even ordered our entrees. he took forever to bring our cocktails and took forever to come check on us, to see if we liked our food.they also seated us in the middle of two tables, leaving no space for anyone to walk thru, causing the to ask my friend to move so they could get by! wtf?!? isn&#39;t that a fire hazard?i will not be coming here again.

Dosa is in a great location across from the Sundance Kabuki Theater. It is always busy (reservation recommended) and I thought we should try it. So here&#39;s the good and bad in a nutshell:The good: The ambiance - The restaurant is beautiful and stylish, with two-level seating. A great place to take your date.The service - these servers were on fire! Constantly refilling waters, folding my boyfriend&#39;s napkin when he left to go to the restroom, great food descriptions from our server.The price - really reasonable for the dosas (avg. $10), okay for the curries (avg. $15)Nice touches to the food - Organic chicken and real shaved coconut in the rice.The bad: The overly salted food. We had the Chennai Chicken (appetizer), Chutney Masala Dosa, and the Chicken Korma. All the dishes, especially the chennai chicken and the dosa with it&#39;s various dipping sauces tasted like someone had upended an entire bottle of salt onto each of our dishes. We absolutely loved everything else about the restaurant, but were sorely disappointed by this!That is why it gets 3 stars. After all, what is a restaurant if its food doesn&#39;t taste good?

I have eaten here many times. The food is consistently great. I haven&#39;t found anything I don&#39;t adore! We are Indian food aficianados and Dosa is at the top of my list. The decor is beautiful, certainly one of the best in the ciity. My only real puzzlement is the wine list. I have never found a wine I like. And its a shame because I really like to have a glass of wine with my dinner. I have given up. Every time I go, I inspect the wine list in case they have changed it, but am consistently disappointed. I noticed all the other critiques don&#39;t mention wine, so it&#39;s not just me. I guess you can&#39;t have everything, but it would be nice!

Without a doubt, the most stunning Indian restaurant in the city, and probably anywhere in California. The chandeliers were particularly beautiful, as were the unique art installations and stencils. I cannot express how good it feels to eat quality Indian food in a setting that lives up to it. Refreshing in a city of budget options from the subcontinent.And given the ambiance, the prices are no higher than the Valencia location, which is a nice plus. We sampled a huge variety of dishes, listed below:- apps: chennai chicken (a standby), the calamari, and the coconut cauliflower soup (now becoming an addiction)- entrees: kerala fish moilee was the hit of the night. Chicken baingan bharta and lamb curry were runners up. Paneer and peas dosa was excellent.- dessert: pistachio kulfi and rasmalai. Good but can&#39;t match the rest of the food.- Wine: Margerum M5 from Santa Barbara. Without a doubt our favorite wine to accompany Dosa&#39;s menu. Has become the standard wine order.Only issue was the dosa that arrived a half hour after the rest of the food, pretty much bringing the meal to a grinding halt, leading to this four star rating.No doubt we will be back though, late dosa or not.

I went to Dosa for a drink with friends. I was surprised by a very nice bar space and a great place to mingle. The appetizers were delicious and the drinks were well made. This place is a nice place to stop by before a show at the Filmore. I cannot wait to try a dinner here.

Having failed to get in to a restaurant down the street, my party happened to walk by Dosa at just the right time, and we were seated immediately during the dinner rush on a Friday night. Very lucky!The place was packed, but our service did not suffer much. We ordered a round of their specialty cocktails; the flavors were fun and unique even if a little unexpected. One member of our party was surprised to taste the bright acidity of a gastrique in his mango beverage.We started with two soups: the beet soup was rich, smooth, brightly colored, and tasted just as it should have--like beets. I preferred the roasted red pepper and coconut milk soup, which tasted like a Thai curry without the rice. I liked it so much I had a hard time sharing.The dosas were wonderful, even by the strict standards of our Indian friends, who grew up on their mother&#39;s homemade dosas. My duck, spinach, and paneer entree was good, though perhaps a little heavy on the cloves and anise. I tried with with both the lemon and coconut flavored rices, and found that the flavor of the rice made little difference to the assertive curry. My husband&#39;s fish entree was a bit lighter, and was wonderful with the coconut rice.Overall, the decor and ambiance combined with the pulsing techno music made this place a little too trendy for me, but I&#39;d love to try the other location sometime because the food was great.

I took a group of 4 here for an evening dinner. We had to wait a few minutes for our table which was fine. We wanted to sample their specialty cocktails at the bar anyways. Their list is filled with spiced cocktails that would fit most palettes. Mine just so happened to burn the hell out of my mouth, in a good way of course. We then sat down to dinner in the balcony section to a great view of the restaurant. All the food we ordered was very tasty and easily shared by the group. It&#39;s a great place to order a few entrees and dive in to whatever is on the table. Every dish was well portioned and filled with flavor. I have recommended this place to many people and will continue to do so. Keep up the great work.

very good, and personable service, although very expensive for indian foodi came for lunch, and got their samosas, dahi vada, and habanero dosa.samosas: good, but you only get 2 (1 north, 1 south). i would have preferred 2 of each, just smaller size... but im being nit-picky...dahi vada: refreshing! goodhabanero dosa: well, let me talk about the filling and dipping sauces first: the coconut dipping sauce was very tasty and balanced the dosa well. the potato filling could have been a meal itself, it was so good.the &#34;dosa&#34;: oh my goodness, when they say that it is hot, they mean it. the waitress warned me before i placed my final order. she said that &#34;some people say its so hot they feel like their face melts off.&#34; well, it was hot. it burned going down, and, well, it caused me to spend a good half hour on my throne later. it was good, very good, but definitely not for the faint-hearted or anyone who wasn&#39;t raised with sriacha in their baby bottle like i was.ill be back here

The place is pricey and it&#39;s not the food you&#39;re paying for but the rent and decor. Been here for lunch and more recently dinner. Service was meh. Ordered the dosa sampler and can&#39;t say I was at all enthralled with any of them. I like flavorful food and just found it to be bland. Would give the Mango lassi a 2 star as well. Just found the place to be a letdown. Would rather go somewhere with tasty food. Left feeling cheated.

Yum yum yum. Went here on a Friday night around 7pm without reservations (3 of us) and had to wait only 30 min. Had a great table upstairs. Our waitress was very nice, helpful without being too overbearing or absent.We ordered 2 apps- calamari and fried asparagus, both delish although on the smaller side. Only 4 asparagus spears on the plate, normal to small size. Small plate of calamari, too, with a little slaw, but great flavors.Then, we had the masala dosa, another pancake-like dish with caramelized onions, a slow-cooked chicken dish with the lemon rice and a puffy fried wheat bread. The dosa was my favorite, reminded me of a doughy crepe. The lentil soup that came with both of the &#34;dosas&#34; was quite spicy. Portions seem to be average, not huge but not small either. Oh, also had a diet coke that came in a small glass bottle, no refills :(.Loved the decor! Super clean bathrooms. Would take out-of-towners here in a heartbeat!

Very arrogant ! Called to make reservations for 6 and I was asked to give them a credit card number to hold the reservation. Their policy for charging $10 per head for parties of 5 or more for cancellations prior to 5pm same day is just ridiculously arrogant.I never cancel without giving plenty of advance notice. But this is just insulting. Since when is a party of 6 a big party ? They just lost my business. Plenty of other places in the city where I don&#39;t have to put up with this attitude.

A couple friends took me here for my birthday. Dosa was indeed enjoyable. As for my first time having Southern Indian cuisine, i thought the food was great. I liked the Bhel poori and the chennai chicken alot. Also this coconut soup was delicious too. I loved their cup of hot chai and coffee. Their coffee almost tasted like milk tea but with a different after taste to it. Very classy and elegant. Cool atmosphere. The space and colors of the interior. along with the nice decorations are warm and welcoming. Be sure to make reservations.

We went here on Sat night for a bday celebration w/ one of dearest.. Excitement abounds; mommy pals out for the eve is a serious impetus for toasting! The structure of a fab dinner were all in place-- organic meat and local sourced produce? Check! Innovative cocktail menu with random &#34;tincture&#34; ingredients thrown in? Double check! Big cosy booth that lends itself to a &#34;sleepover&#34; sort of intimacy? The trifecta! So why less than stellar outcome? Well.. service was that flawed combo of pushy, but lacking in precision. When you ask a server for recommendations, you don&#39;t need a slippery fish, you need succinct decision-making. Sometimes that means a willingness to slam a few items to illustrate their point of what really is advised. In this case, everything was rosy.. but nothing really clear. And descriptions were off-- Me: is the crab cake breaded and deep fried? Her: NO! Not at all.. pan fried, much crab.. and then a deep fried potato pancake basically appeared a few minutes later.. ahem. Also, they didn&#39;t carry Belvedere vodka, which makes a liquor snob a little grievous. And while the food gets points for innovative, (i did like the mung bean salad and the lentil dipping soup), the other dishes lackluster.. heavy and spicy, but not subtle or elegant. I don&#39;t know, maybe the waitress just uber annoyed. At the end of the meal to move on along the push was enormous.. which my mommy friend needed none of.. and a 2nd cocktail wasn&#39;t ever solicited! So you see, i may take my weekend eve enthusiasm elsewhere..

Where to start? Was definitely excited to be eating here, having heard about it from friends. Went with two young children. Big mistake. We eat in lots of Indian restaurants with our daughter, this one went out of its way to be not kid-friendly. Fine enough, their choice, but even alone we would not have been happy. Tables way too close together, food not authentic (that was not a samosa), food too spicy for most of our friends, let alone the kids, and nothing was exceptional. We&#39;ve had way better and won&#39;t be back for any more of this.

I like this addition to the neighborhood.Authentic or not I don&#39;t know but an Indian chef of a four star restaurant in the city recommended it. He said the food was very good and now that I&#39;ve had it I agree.We couldn&#39;t get a reservation and the place was extremely packed (to be expected since its new and getting buzz). We patiently waited for a couple &#34;squatters&#34; to leave and then ate at the bar though which was just fine.Bartender was very friendly, attentive, and patient even though it was busy. He also comped us a glass of wine for accidentally ringing up one wrong item which they brought to us but fixed very quickly.Chicken Biryani, Somosas, and Wheat Dosa were all excellent, and portions were big by SF standards. All round great but not perfect service made even better by how they treated their mistake.

Totally lame. But let me start with the positives. Awesome that the owners are trying to introduce south indian food to the masses. The dining room itself is nicely done although transparently trendy in kind of a lame way. I took my south Indian boyfriend and....we were dissapointed. The price is way too high for what you get, spices are toned down for a western palate and the service SUCKED. They seated uis late, the women servers had snobby whiny voices and the food seriously was mediocre. SARAVANA BHAVAN in Sunnyvale is what incredible South Indian food tastes like. Granted, it is not at all hip but it is all Indian folks, cheap and the real deal. So if you want to be seen at the newest place go to DOSA. If you want good value and food, I would pass.

If you&#39;re looking for non standard Indian fare then this is your place. They have LOADS of vegetarian options, really inventive cocktails, and a wonderful wine list (new fav: Chakalaka). We like to go before a show at The Fillmore or a movie at the Kabuki. I can&#39;t resist ordering the Channa Bhatura each time I go... I love that bread and chick peas. The atmosphere is fun and beautiful. Great for parties, special occasions, out of town guest, etc.

Dosa the disappointing! We had heard lots of raves about this place &amp; were really looking forward to eating here. What a letdown! We had nice drinks at the bar &amp; service was pleasant- one star for this. Food was &#34;not bad&#34;, (weak praise but there&#39;s the other star). We were seated with reservations on time but the tables were so close my neighbor&#39;s butt was in my plate when she had to get up. Music in the restaurant was most times too loud to hear anything anyone was saying at our table. We could however hear everything to the right &amp; left of each other because we were so darn crammed in near other tables. An extremely uncomfortable evening. Will never go back.

My wife and I arrived yesterday night at around 5:30pm asking for a table for 5. Our friends were in the area looking for parking and we were hoping that we could sit down first. Although the restaurant was nearly empty, we were asked to wait for about 15 minutes instead of getting seated right away. I felt like Ben Stiller in &#34;Meet the Parents&#34; in the scene where he was asked to wait to board the flight when no one else was getting on the plane! Of course, in the meantime, we were badgered by the hostess confirming with us whether or not our friends were on their way. When our friends did arrive, and we were by then deciding whether or not we wanted to just eat at the bar or do a sit-down dinner, 2 hostesses and a waiter were pushing us to have a seat at that point! Needless to say, my first impression was not very good as the staff were interrupting a quick conversation among friends deciding what we wanted to do. I understand they wanted us to sit down and get that mandatory 20% tip for parties of 5 or more, but c&#39;mon! They might as well have acted like the hostess at Claw in the movie &#34;Date Night&#34; where they would answer their telephone by saying, &#34;Welcome to Dosa, you&#39;re welcome!&#34;The food is good with small portions and pricey, but that is what you would probably expect here given the decor. Our wait staff was friendly enough, but she was obviously displeased when we were just having appetizers and drinks (hey, we wanted to sit at the bar!).So overall, the food is decent, albeit pricey, but the hostesses could definitely do a better job at being a lot less snooty! It could have been a one time thing given the other reviews, but I&#39;m not planning on going back anytime soon.

As someone who was born in Madras (Dosa capital of the world) I can vouch for the authenticity in their taste. Sure they have made some improvisations, but it tastes great. Most South Indians places are a hole in the wall types, so this makes Dosa rare rare place. I went their first time with a friend. We kinda thought this place would suck in their food but went mainly for the ambiance. We were both pleasantly surprised/shocked at how good the dishes were. Dahi Vada, Tamil vegetable curry were awesome. Some hole in the wall places in sunnyvale charge 3/4 their price, for arguably more authentic dishes but substandard veggies/meat. So I would highly recommend this place. I loved it...

What a treat to have such a classic South Indian restaurant in the city! The taste of the dosa&#39;s and sambhar is really authentic. I would recommend people to try Spring dosa, its just too good! The ambience &amp; service was very very good. Just loved the place!

Attractive light-filled space; very tasty dosa (I had the Masala) and condiments. The free papadums were a nice touch too.

The service was good but the food was only so so. I&#39;ve been to the Dosa on Valencia three times and enjoyed the atmosphere and food much more there.

So last night I went to Dosa and was really impressed. First of all, the space is amazing. Very cool, very hip, and not pretentious at all. The specialty cocktails are really good, if not a little pricey, and the food is not only great but also in my opinion a great value. I started with a Smoked Cup (cocktail) which was really tasty, and had a bowl of the beet soup to start. I am a total fan of beets anyway, but this soup was fabulous. Progressing to the main course, I had the paneer and peas uttapam with a side of spicy achar. Also fabulous. But at this point I was getting kind of full (although I managed to clean my plate, achar and all). So my friend Tasha was taking a little longer than I to finish, and as is our custom I sat a little impatiently while she picked at her masala dosa, which she also loved. While I was waiting I decided to order a cup of chai to give me something to do. The chai was delicious but drinking that cup of hot tea-flavored milk sent me over the edge. I left the restaurant super uncomfortable because I was so full, but vowing to come back. Good thing for the 6-block walk home.

I don&#39;t eat Indian food often because I can&#39;t usually handle the spice. But some friends wanted to try this place. It was dimly lit, but very elegant inside. And surprisingly full at 8pm on a Monday night. We sat at the bar and waited for a table. My friend decided to try the Maharaja Indian beer, which he said wasn&#39;t bad. Then they seated our party of four on a small, round table that I would normally be used for 4 people in a bar or coffee shop (definitely not enough room to put all the food we were going to order). So minus 1 star.We decided to order several items a la carte and share instead of going with the $39 pre-fixe menu. We first started with 2 appetizers: Chennai Chicken and Chochin Calamari. Both were pretty tasty, and a tad bit spicy. We then ordered 3 entrees and 1 dosa (Jumbo Prawns Masala, Spiced Lamb Chops, Kerala Fish Moilee, and Spring Dosa). My favorites were the prawns and the spring dosa, although the lamb and fish had good flavor. We also had sides of lemon rice, coconut rice, and cilantro rice and one bhatura (which was yummy with the curries). Now with all the food mentioned above, it was quite a feat for us to try to squeeze it onto the table. It was a little annoying that the wait staff did not offer much help in trying to accodomate the small table they gave us with offereing to transfer items to smaller plates (but the busboy was helpful). Also, the waiter knew we were sharing items, but they only gave us small plates during the appetizers and then cleared them away (although we wouldn&#39;t have room for additional plates). My boyfriend and I ended up using the empty dosa plate and eating off of that. I was pretty stuffed by the end, but we ate pretty much everything.For dessert, we had the Gulab Jamoon and Toasted Coconut and Saffrom Barfi. Unfortuantely I wasn&#39;t a big fan of hte Gulab Jamoon (I don&#39;t really like my friend things all soggy with syrup) and the Toasted Coconut was tasty, but reminded me of a Chinese bun that I can get easily. So next time I&#39;ll probably skip dessert.Lastly, when we received the bill, there were 2 drinks on there that we did not order. We flagged down a waitress, who took about 10 minutes to get us the correct bill (and she was not our original waiter because he was nowhere in sight, and I&#39;m assuming she took over his tables because she took the order of the table next to us and took our bill when we were ready to pay. But I guess I&#39;ll never know for sure because our waiter wasn&#39;t around for the last 20 minutes we were there). Bill came out to about $200 ($50/person). Slightly more than exprected but the meal was pretty good.

This place has way improved! The only funny thing was the service which was awkward and intrusive. The puri though with the channa masala was fabulous. Wish there were some more inexpensive wines on the list to really give the option of having a super reasonable meal.

This is my new favorite restaurant in SF!! There are so many restaurants in this city that do the same thing... French-Californian over and over. We keep going back because these places have nice atmospheres, good service, good beverages, and decent food. Well Dosa takes it to a whole new level! They have the great atmosphere, great service, really great cocktails and wine selection and the food is FANTASTIC! No more of the bland French-Californian mediocrity. The flavors, combinations, and presentations of the food are unlike I&#39;ve ever seen. The food is just as good if not better than the Valencia location and the atmosphere is 10 times better. Not to mention the creative cocktail options they have introduced. I had some sort of cocktail with gin, lime, chili, and curry that had more levels of flavor than I have ever experienced in a cocktail. I also highly recommend the duck spinach with paneer masala!! PS the prices are very reasonable. I will be recommending this place to all my friends!

Food was great. Let&#39;s be clear on that point. The fried bread, Bhatura, was out of this world and has completely spoiled me for ever on delicious fried doughs. But I am very disappointed in their wine situation. Do NOT, I repeat, DO NOT order wine by the glass from Dosa under any circumstances. They have the smallest pours of any restaurant I have ever eaten at in my entire life. All 3 of the glasses of wine my dinner party ordered last night were ridiculously tiny. We&#39;re talking maybe 4 oz at best. For a $8 to $12 glass of wine, that&#39;s just plan disrespectful of your customers and honestly, despite the wonderful draw of their food, makes me not want to return. I don&#39;t think a restaurant that can&#39;t find it&#39;s way to pouring a decent size glass of wine, given how much money they already make off wine and spirits given the serious markups they have, deserves my business no matter how fabulous the food. So be warned. Dosa short changes you like nothing I have ever seen before when it comes to wine. OH and side note, their Raita is good but not fabulous and certainly not worth the $4.50 for the tiny cup they serve you as a side order. It&#39;s quite absurd.
