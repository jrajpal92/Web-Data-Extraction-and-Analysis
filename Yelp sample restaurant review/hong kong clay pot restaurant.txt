Nothing special here. We each got a clay pot meal...mine chicken, his seafood. Adding quite a bit of soy sauce helped to add some flavor - other than that it was somewhat bland.However, the fried baby octopus were sensational. We should have just gotten a meal of those.Staff was nice though!

We had high hopes for this restaurant, but it was a really unique experience but not on the entirely positive side.We scouted some Yelp reviews and the chicken clay pot and a fish clay pot. The chicken one seemed to draw the most rave reviews so we opted for that one and was looking forward to it. Sadly it was really salty and a bit flat in flavor. Not much else to say about it. However my fish clay pot was better. The pieces of fish were nicely cooked and the sauce was pretty good. Both pots were about $12 each. Oh we also got fried shrimp for an appetizer but that was really disappointing. Literally it tasted like it came from a bag of frozen shrimp from your local supermarket with they typical bright red sweet n sour sauce from your average Chinese American restaurant.

Fast service, no-frills establishment. I got the seafood and tofu clay pot for lunch. The fish fillet and squid used were fresh and flavorful, the tofu struck a good balance between the slightly crispy skin and tender interior, and the shiitake mushrooms lent a rich aroma to the dish. The umami of the raw ingredients is brought out without the use of heavy condiments like soy sauce.

This place does not get the credit it deserves. I have eaten here several times. The food is really good whether you are there for traditional Chinese dishes or even Americanized Chinese food such as kung pao chicken. I love their gai lan and their crab or lobster dishes that they have. The staff is very friendly and honest. This place is a family style restaurant and is great for groups. If you ever get the chance, the seating by the windows has a nice view of the China Town from above. I would also like to note that this places bathrooms are very clean for it being a China Town restaurant. I have been eating at China Town Restaurants my whole life. They often scream &#34;Dead things Mikey! Dead things!&#34; (Goonies reference). That being said, Hong Kong Clay Pot does a really good job at keeping their restrooms clean.

When in Rome.........oooops, I mean, when in Chinatowm...why not go with a local restaurant tucked up a steep staircase on the second floor above a souvenir shop?!?!I loved the adventure. We were among local folks eating lunch in their neighborhood. People watching was awesome.I ordered the chicken and tofu in a clay pot......I got chicken and curry in a clay pot. Ha. Who&#39;s to argue.....I was more than pleased with the mix of flavors and the size. Wow! Luckily I had a willing participant to help me out with the quantity. LolThe women&#39;s bathroom was tucked behind a small flowered material curtain (yes, there was a door behind the curtain!) It was very private.I&#39;m glad we ventured in to this place. I would def recommend it. It was clean and our server was cute and charming. She spoke little English but was more than willing to take pics of us at our table. SMILE...click click!!!

We recently had some guests in town who wanted to experience some real Chinatown and Hong Kong Clay Pot was a great fit! The service was fast and all of the wait staff was friendly. The food was delicious, hot, and the portions were just right. It isn&#39;t the cleanest (-1 star) but definitely a good spot.We had 4 (hungry) people with 3 chicken entrees, fried rice, (2) steamed rice, and spring rolls and walked out full and happy.

I don&#39;t write too many reviews but this was too good not to share! My husband and I shared the Kung Pao Chicken, Mongolian Beef, and BBQ Pork Fried Rice. The Mongolian Beef was the favorite of the 3 but all three were awesome ! The green tea they serve upon being seated is the best I&#39;ve ever had, now I finally know what true green tea tastes like. Wish I asked them where I could buy it to bring some home. This has been our cheapest meal so far btw (3rd day here) and our favorite!

I went to this restaurant a long time back. We were strolling down on the streets of Chinatown. I was looking at Yelp and figuring out which restaurant to try out. Clay pot sounded interesting, so gave it a try. The restaurant gives a homely feeling. Our server was really sweet. We were served with complimentary tea, which had nice herbal taste. I ordered lobster in clay pot, don&#39;t know if they still have it on menu. It was served with vermicelli. I was asked if I want my lobster to be cracked open and I said yes. Well, I should have said no as because of this my dish had many pieces of shell in it. Otherwise, the dish tasted yum. I will recommend this place.

Overall, Food: 6/5Overall, service: 3/5This was definitely some of the best and yummiest Chinese food I&#39;ve ever had. We ordered the pot stickers, honey walnut prawns and the chicken pan fried noodles. All the food was so freaking good. Like I just want to eat here every day (although I might die of sodium overload, I think it would be a worthy death).The one downside- the service was less than awesome. We came in about 1:15pm and the place was full the entire time we were there. We were sat in a corner table and I think they forgot we were there. We ordered fairly quickly and got our pot stickers within 15-20 minutes. The honey walnut prawns came another 15 after that. Then 40 minutes went by before we got our pan fried noodles, which was less than ideal.

This is definitely a good place to get the real Chinatown experience. Upstairs, out of the way, a mix of locals and tourists and more focus on authentic food than flashy presentation.We ordered seafood clay pot, chicken curry clay pot, cashew chicken and sesame chicken and all of us were very happy with what we got. My seafood clay pot had great flavor but could have used a little less squid and tofu.

Tagged along with my coworkers who had some serious hankerings for some claypot. The place they WANTED to go to happened to be closed on a Tuesday (random) and a quick yelp search revealed to us this place as a another great option.Our dining experience was exactly as we should have had because we did not do research prior. Since it was a cantonese hole in the wall family restaurant I suspected that things would be served family style here-- my coworkers didn&#39;t believe me and insisted on order a WHOLE clay pot each. (too much food alert!) Our server (though nice), didn&#39;t fully understand us when we order 4 of the chicken and Chinese sausage claypot. After some discussion with her in Cantonese she suggested we maybe bring that number down to 3 and add a garlic pea shoot dish instead. My coworkers and I ended up sharing family style the veggies, the 3 GIGANTIC same chicken and sausage clay pots, and 1 tofu and chicken claypot. We also received free soup from the lovely waitress as an appetizer-- delicious!Though not a huge fan of the 3 chicken and Chinese sausage clay pots (it was 70% onion) I DID love the pea shoots and tofu and chicken claypot. The tofu was not the fried kind-- it was soft silky tofu mixed with minced chopped chicken and green onions. Paired with white rice, it was fantastic. And at $8.95 a pot?! It was such a steal.Overall, nice service, great affordable pricing, hole in the restaurant that is a bit hard to find, delicious clay pot; and lessoned learned-- ITS FAMILY STYLE don&#39;t be afraid to share all kinds of dishes with each other!

This place is the absolute sh-t! Authentic, original, and almost universally beloved, it&#39;s more than worth the trek upstairs to this almost-hidden gem.My girlfriend and I happened upon this place and didn&#39;t know what to expect, but were highly impressed. The clay pot anything is good. The salt and pepper anything is good. I&#39;m not sure there&#39;s a single dish this place can&#39;t execute well, although to be fair I&#39;ve only tried about one quarter of the menu. Highly recommended.

Fantastic pot stickers! The cashew chicken was yummy and the Mongolian chicken/beef/prawns was good too, just a little spicy. The wonton soup was huge and a great way to start our meal :) The waitress was a sweetheart and gave us great recommendations. The restaurant itself is very cute, open and lots of natural light.

This restaurant was quite underwhelming. We tried a bunch of dishes for dinner but there wasn&#39;t anything that stood out. I think the food could have used more seasoning.The beef chow fun was oily and had some flavor but I&#39;ve definitely had better ones before. The chicken clay pot tasted like generic chicken and broccoli. The bok Choy was standard. The corn soup also lacked flavor so I had to add some salt.

It was just ok. The place is small and cramped, though that doesn&#39;t bother me much since it&#39;s food that I come for. We were seated after a wait of maybe 15 minutes. It took another 15 minutes to have our order taken and another 20 minutes for the food to come. That&#39;s almost an hour just to get the food. We were surprised that rice did not come with dishes which in every other Chinese restaurant I&#39;ve been in it would come with. Luckily, a couple of us ordered noodle dishes so we just shared.Now the food, it was just ok. Really, it was a good Chinese restaurant but nothing better than I have had in the Washington DC and Pittsburgh areas. This was a let down considering this is China Town in San Francisco. Not worth it at all. Go to Golden Star down the street for Pho that will amaze instead (cash only). Now that was amazing food.

This restaurant is in the heart of Chinatown. If you&#39;re looking for something fancy then don&#39;t come here. However, if you want delicious, authentic, Cantonese food with reasonable prices and fast service then this is your place. My husband and I shared a hot and sour soup, a chicken noodle chow mein and a kung pao chicken with a side of white rice. It was more than enough food for the both of us. We ended up taking some home. One other thing I enjoyed was sitting by the window and looking down onto the street.

One hell of an experience.Going up the stairs, you&#39;re probably wondering what you&#39;re getting yourself into. Then you&#39;re in a bustling dining room.Our servers were adorably aggressive, up-selling us from 2 appetizers to 4. But then we were too full for anything but tea so we missed the clay pots.The pot stickers were a little under-cooked. We didn&#39;t finish them.The fried wontons and fried prawns were excellent!The spring rolls were meh.Pro tip: the chile sauce looks much like the sweet sauce, as I discovered rather catastrophically.

This is tucked away on the second floor but we had no trouble finding it. The food is 100% amazing. We loved all the dishes we tried. Excellent. The only reason for loosing a star is the bathroom...I won&#39;t let that stop me from eating there again but it is pretty off putting and some would be too disgusted to eat there.

I&#39;ve been to a small theater located on the second story of a hotel, wherein I had to traverse a seemingly narrow staircase.Why not eat at a Cantonese restaurant located on the second story of a narrow staircase as well? What have I got to lose?The theater was great and made a distinct impression on me, in spite of its oddity. Why should this place be any different? Or at least I tried to tell myself that.When I am in Chinatown, I normally eat at normal places such as the House of Nanking. But this time, I wanted a change. A departure from the norm. Therefore, I sought out this odd, unassuming restaurant on the second floor.I was prepared to be greatly surprised; especially since I was famished after a long walk.Needless to say, my expectations were met with utter disappointment. The service was less than marginal, and the foodwas probably the blandest Cantonese cuisine I have ever tasted in my entire life. It was totally uninspired, and under cooked.I had the Chicken Curry, the Chicken Lo Mein, and the Fried Rice. Besides the fact that it took forever for them to navigate through the myriad of patrons in this small place to take my order, they also took forever to get me my food. At least, if the food was great, it would&#39;ve made up for the aggravation of having to wait.Such was not the case here. Every aspect of my expectations where completely unsatisfied.With the myriad of places to eat in Chinatown, I was hoping that this would be a great find.The only thing worth finding here was the exit!

Arrived at 7:30pm for dinner on Friday. There&#39;s a short wait but like an authentic Chinese restaurant, they seated us quickly and we shared a table with another group. We order the beef stew claypot (sooooo good! It&#39;s was hot and sizzling), chicken and salted fish fried rice (flavorful and not greasy at all, definitely recommend this), the on choy (water spinach), and hot and sour soup. If you come, you have to order at least one clay pot. It&#39;s the best I&#39;ve had in the Bay Area!! They even gave us sesame paste for dessert

The entrance to this place is literally a staircase in the wall. Once we made our way to the top of the staircase, we saw a packed restaurant. The place was super busy, and equally full of locals &amp; tourist. We were lucky to be seated at a small table that only had room for the two of us. Be prepared to SHARE your table, if you visit this restaurant. I noticed that they were sitting three different parties at one table (I witnessed this at least three times) I would have not been happy, if I had to share a table. This is not a fancy place, but the food is good. We ordered the spicy scallops and the fried rice. We ate everything, even though we were full. I would definitely eat here again.

Ah. Real Chinese food. Hot and sour soup. Chicken sausage clay pot. Shrimp chow fun bok choy and even the white rice is awesome. All the dishes were boiling hot from when they came out to when we couldn&#39;t put another morsel in our mouths. Awesome when I can have REAL all natural tasting Chinese food. Which Miami has none. Only problem with China town is u either have to eat lunch or an early dinner. Most places close by six. Some by nine.

HK Clay Pot was a decent Cantonese-styled restaurant. The service here is above average as compared to other Chinese restaurants. We ordered the fish and bean curd clay pot and one of the veggies (sorry, not sure what the English name is). The clay pot tasted good, but was definitely laden with MSG which made me feel guiltier as I kept eating. I needed a lot of white rice to balance it out. The veggies I got were just okay. They were a bit too stringy for my taste.3 stars because the food is decent, but nothing amazing.

Wait stop. You just probably just walked past this little, beautiful hole in the wall staircase that leads to the Hong Kong Clay Pot. This restaurant is the real deal. We were lucky to come here right after the lunch rush, so we were able to get our food quickly and had no problems with seating. It&#39;s small, can be a little cramped if it&#39;s very busy, but the food is well worth it. Since I don&#39;t eat meat I ordered the Vegetarian Clay Pot. The food came out still boiling (do not touch anything) and I enjoyed a beer while chatting and waiting for it to cool down.Once it cooled down enough to not send me to the ER I dug in and was very delighted. Despite the dish basically just being vegetables in a stew more or less, it was fantastic and left me feeling not hungry but not bloated and full either.If you&#39;re using your GPS to find the place, make sure you look for the staircase in the wall and try not to walk past.

I came here yesterday for take-out food. Everyone raved about the hot &amp; sour soup so I got it. I didn&#39;t think it was particularly amazing...barely any &#34;sour&#34; to it. It did have the right texture though compared to a lot of other places in Chinatown, which tend to be watered down.I wanted to get the lobster noodles that I saw on their menu online. Turns out their menu is super outdated. All the prices have increased dramatically. The lobster noodles, listed at $16.95 (or something close) turned out to be $25.95. Um, no thanks. I think the soup increased to like $7 or $8 too.I got the beef chow fun instead which was pretty good but I&#39;m just disappointed with how much they charge now.

I was visiting San Francisco and randomly found myself in Chinatown. As a child of Chinese immigrants, I tend to hold Chinese restaurants to ptetty high standards. This is a great hole in the wall and every table was filled by the time I showed up around 6:30 on a Friday night. There appeared to be a pretty good mix of tourists and locals. Luckily, my party was seated right away (another party was leaving as we arrived), but we did see a number of people standing around awkwardly as they waited for their tables. There&#39;s not a lot of room to wait, but food comes quickly and the tables turned over accordingly. Service was not too attentive, but not atypical of an average chinese restaurant, and it was fine for me.We ordered the oxtail hotpot and green beans in xo sauce. Both were tasty and well cooked, although slightly oily and heavier than I&#39;d want for everyday fare. The green beans were surprisingly buttery, juicy, and sweet--in a good way. Also, tea is not usually something I comment on, but this house tea was great! All in all, nothing mind blowing, but I would eat again.

Pretty good Chinese food. Service was average but food was pretty good. We ordered kung pao chicken, pan fried chicken noodles, and shrimp fried rice. BTW- the restaurant is on the second floor.KUNG PAO CHICKEN 5/5- The kung pao was quite good. It was simple yet flavorful. I was really surprised to see that they actually gave enough chicken in the dish! Most Chinese restaurants rip you off by giving you two pieces of chicken and a bunch of vegetables. This place actually gave a lot of chicken with a fair amount of vegetables. Much appreciated!PAN FRIED CHICKEN NOODLES 4/5- Good noodles. Not great, not horrible.SHRIMP FRIED RICE 4.5/5- Shrimp was awesome. Rice wasn&#39;t sticky rice, but regular white rice. A little bit more soy sauce would have been nice.Another plus: This place is one of the nice restaurants in Chinatown (as in it&#39;s not rundown like most of the other places.)

Ate dinner here while walking in Chinatown. Looked up restaurants nearby on Four Square application and this came up. Tried soup, clay pot and chow fun. The soup had no flavor, clay pot was good with mucho onions, and chow fun was average tasting. Good thing, NO MSG detected. Most entrees about $8.99. Service was fast but we ate early and only one of two tables occupied. Restroom near the front door was relatively clean albeit small and cramped. Overall environment looked clean. They should wipe down their greasy salt shakers when they srart dinner shift.

While the signage above the doorway is not obvious the address and Yelp maps are spot-on. One door was propped open with the lunch and dinner menus in a small basket. Head up the steep but do-able stairs and go right at the top. (to the left are the restrooms). With sitting for about forty (if they were crammed) this is not a huge place, but you&#39;ve got about ten tables in one large room. most tables are for four (two comfortably) there are several larger rounds with lazy-susan spinner in the middle that work for six to eight.There are about 150 items on the dinner menu plus specials for groups of two to eight.The Pork with Tofu and Chili sauce #118 (7.95) was very enjoyable. The tofu (perhaps homemade) was silky soft and the browned pork and chilies made for a nice textural variation with some heat.The Pot-sticker appetizers # 2 (4.75) were well sized and crispy brown on one side and doughy chewy on the other with ample filling of pork. Very good! IMO, ignore the sweet pink-red sauce they serve to the &#34;outside the neighborhood&#34; tourists and enjoy plain or lightly touched with soy. Served so hot you can burn your mouth.The &#34;prawns&#34; with cashews #83 (9.50) was fairly tasty... but to be picky they were shrimp not prawns and were tiny. This could have benefited from either more sauce and or more spicy heat. But ok none the less.Served with white rice on the side which was properly cooked and served steaming hot and just sticky enough to clump and hold together with chopsticks. Yum.We took some House Fried Rice # 63 to go, it was ok, and probably would have been better eaten hot and fresh, so I really can&#39;t say anything more.Service was efficient and no nonsense, fine enough. The prices are super reasonable, really kind of a bargain. Get there within 15 minutes of them opening and there is no wait for a table, for dinner.

I don&#39;t know...maybe I visited on the wrong day and time, but it was disappointing. And trust me, I really wanted to like the food, especially when I brought family over from the east coast. The service was slow which I understand because it was packed. But oven hot with just some small fans? And have to ask for water three times? The party package was not available for whatever reasons so we had to order everything individually at the typed price, and I was okay with that as well.We ordered a total of 7 dishes for a party of 4 adults and 3 kids. To my dismay, the taste was just mediocre and the portions were pretty small compared to what I expected from a dated restaurant. It was barely filling. For what I&#39;ve paid and eaten, it was simply disappointing and unsatisfying.Three stars for the food, minus one for the hot, muggy room, minus one for the portion, but plus one for the hardworking waitress. Yes, she was tipped. But sorry, I will never ever come back. :/

This is your typical &#34;hole-in-the-wall&#34; Chinese restaurant offering you odd decor, poor service, and dirty restrooms.Four stars is somewhat of a generous review for this restaurant. So why the the good rating?! Cuz thats how good the food is!!We got the seafood clay pot, chicken fried rice and salt and pepper pork. All dishes were soooooo good especially the salt and pepper pork. If i were to get another clay pot dish i&#39;d get one with tofu next time.In addition to the poor service, expect to wait close to a half hour to get your bill.

After looking at Yelp and seeing that this restaurant not only had good reviews but also only 2 $$ we were in. I love a great deal!! The won ton soup was delicious!!!! You know its going to be good when the broth alone is delectable!! We ordered way too much food but had a nice meal again so really made it cheap with all the leftovers. Trying to be healthy we ordered the Vegetarian Clay Pot and it was awesome!! My mouth is watering thinking about it now!!! We had a very nice server and a great seat at the window for people watching.

Really quick service, good food and lots of variety! Definitely order just one dish and share with whoever you&#39;re out with (the serving sizes are quite large). We had some communication issues with our waitress and the bathrooms were awful but all in all, it was a good dinner.

You walk up a dingy set of stairs (they are ashen with dirt) and instantly hear the loud clamour of Chinese. There are large groups of Chinese families and then small sets of 20-something yuppies. Shit instantly feels legit.We got:Fried bean curds (tofu) - WOW. They fried these just right. Each tofu had a light exterior and the inside is a silky tofu. I am not a huge tofu fan but this was magical.Potstickers - large hearty potstickers that tasted extremely fresh. Came with this spicy sweet and sour sauce that was delicious.Ma Po Tofu (I think they had it as tofu and pork in chili sauce) - It wasn&#39;t spicy in the least (when you get ma po tofu you expect extreme spiciness) and was the biggest letdown of the meal. Would probably not get that again.The place wasn&#39;t pristine or clean in the least, but the food was excellent (and inexpensive - but not dirt cheap) and we did not encounter stomach problems.

Fast service and generous portions, food was standard fare for a Chinese please. Personal favorites were the honey walnut shrimp and chow mein.At noon on a Saturday this place was 100% full of Chinese-speaking people (Mandarin/Cantonese if you want to get particular). I guess that might mean this place is authentic, in which case that means that authentic Chinese doesn&#39;t do it for me.

I am not a big fan of Chinese food, but come on. When in Rome and all that. First, note that this is family style. That explains some of the menu prices (low prices =small plates). The sweet and sour chicken is a ho hum typical dish. You&#39;re safe with that if you are worried about what to eat. I had the clay pot fish with black bean mushroom. The fish was great; almost like little potato dumplings. There were large pieces of tofu in it which I didn&#39;t like, but others in my party did. I left full. I am glad we ate here.

As a local Cantonese, Hong Kong Clay Pot Restaurant is one of the best places to try traditional cantonese food, especially with a great affordable price. The dishes are as good as I could expect from any restaurant in Hong Kong. I love the steamed fish -- it&#39;s really hard to find a place in San Francisco with the fish cooked just right coupled with the right soya sauce and scallions. Would love to come again!

I crave Chinese food on average twice a week so I&#39;ve tried just about every decently-reviewed place in Chinatown. You&#39;ll walk up a shady flight of stairs to get to the often-crowded HK Clay Plot, but don&#39;t be alarmed, you&#39;re in for a treat. I&#39;ve been here 4+ times and I&#39;m a firm believer.The food is authentic and flavorful. The waitresses are sassy (seriously) but sweet. And I always leave with a happy stomach.Some must tries: Braised fish filet claypot &amp; peking spareribs. They give a seaweed and egg soup that I like. Pair with a veggie dish and you&#39;re all set.Docking a star because I&#39;m not a fan of cramped spaces. One can dream.

I think everyone except for my mom and I ordered their clay pot here.. the food quality was alright but I questioned how clean their kitchen was because of how old and run down the place was. It was quite stuffy, but definitely a hole in the wall kind of resturant with a lot of regulars during lunch hours. Still not bad though if you&#39;re looking for some Cantonese style home cooking.

I always judge a Chinese restaurant by their beef chow fun and the beef chow fun here was delicious. The beef was tender and plentiful and the flat rice noodles were perfectly cooked.The fish clay pot came with a good amount of fish, tofu, and mushroom. The heat of the clay pot and the flavors work well together. The service was friendly and even gave us some delicious house soup! The traditional erhu music from the streets below fills the restaurant. It was a great Chinatown experience.

Lunch specials are very cheap which is why it&#39;s around 3 stars. I ordered the braised tofu with fish lunch special, husband got the mongolian beef and a side of potstickers (6). They forgot to put fish in my dish, but when I brought it up, they were quick to fix it. There was only 1 chef and 1 sous chef when I was here so food took a very long time (from waiting in line to getting food it was 45min).The mongolian beef should have been called mongolian onion-per husband. There was at least 1 whole medium to large onion in his dish. The beef was good, but wish there was more of it as opposed to filler ingredients. My fish/tofu was good for what it was. All serving sizes were appropriate. The potstickers were huge. This made me happy since in the past sometimes you get tiny little things. The sauce it came with was good as well (red sweet and sour?). Would come here again if I was in the neighborhood looking for something cheap, but not something you should go out of your way for.

After trying a few restaurants, this was probably the best Chinese food we came across in Chinatown SF. It&#39;s somewhat hidden with stairs that lead you to the restaurant on the 2nd floor. The stir-fried noodle dishes and vegetables are delicious with lots of what Cantonese people call &#34;wok-mei&#34; (good wok flavor). Wok-mei is how you distinguish between skilled chefs cooking Chinese food and those that are less experienced. The complimentary house soup they start you off with is bone soup cooked for a long time -- so good! You can&#39;t go wrong with trying different items on the menu; we tried several dishes including the clay pots and everything was delish!

The bf dragged me here raving about how delicious their ox tail stew was. The bf would give it 10 stars if he could. Their entrance is this narrow doorway that immediately leads upstairs, where the restaurant is.We were seated next to the window overlooking Chinatown. The bf ordered two ox tail stews ($10.10 total! so cheap). They gave us complimentary jasmine tea and broth. The broth tasted a little too gingery for me, but the bf loved it. They gave a generous portion of rice, which made the bf extremely happy. (He&#39;s obsessed with rice.)I tasted the ox tail stew, but I wasn&#39;t blown away like he expected me to be. It might be because I have a Korean taste palette and I&#39;m not accustomed to Chinese dish sauces. It had a familiar taste of the sauce used in the chicken feet dish. Nevertheless, I thought the ox tail was pretty good and well worth the money.

This place is a nondescript stairwell in between two junk stores. I don&#39;t think it says Hong Kong Clay Pot Restaurant outside either.Food is pretty good, but it is soooooo slow. I had beef stew wonton hor fun and some fried quails. Noodles were decent, but they give you way too much hor fun (I know, why am I complaining?) Fried quails were yummy. Both for 15$ including tip.All in all, I&#39;d come back, if I have a lot of time.

I had high hopes for this place after checking out its authentic vibe.I really want to give this place 3.5 stars because I thought some of the dishes looked really good but the ones I got ended up being just so-so.The westlake soup was good. The meat was soft and the soup decently flavorful. The waitress handed us the white pepper right away...The chicken and salted fish was decent. Could have used more salt.The beef stew clay pot was the biggest let down for me. Clay pot is in the name so i thought that it would be delicious. Instead the beef was a bit tough and cold whereas the tofu in the broth was scalding hot.The service was also really slow and inattentive. But then again this is a chinese joint so im not taking off many stars for that!

Another Chinese restaurant in chinatown. A group of 12 of us came here and we ordered the set meal which had chicken, quail, soup, fish, shrimp, crab, squid, and greens. Portions were huge and dinner was sumptuous.I would say that the food is pretty decent Chinese, though nothing spectacular. If you&#39;re looking to get some Chinese food fix, I&#39;d say that this place is decent.We ended up not ordering any claypot dishes in spite of the name of the restaurant... which makes me wonder if we&#39;d missed out on any signature claypot dishes? Would definitely love to come back here and give them a try!

Came here last year and this year for Chinese New Year dinner for the boyfriend&#39;s family and I must say there&#39;s a huge improvement.They probably got a new chef, and a better one at that.Last years review would&#39;ve been: bland, bland bland, mediocre, I definitely would not come here again.This year: &#34;Oh heeeeey, it&#39;s not so badddd&#34;Favorites of the night:Honey walnut prawns - Flavorful, decent (last years tasted odd). Could&#39;ve been crispier, but it wasn&#39;t too badLobster: yes, on point. My favorite of the nightSeafood Jeen Mein - Pretty good and flavorful. I definitely wouldn&#39;t mind getting it againOther dishes:Sweet and Sour Pork - Heavy vinegar smell, but good thing it wasn&#39;t and overpowering vinegar taste. Wasn&#39;t chopped nicely so I kept biting onto tiny bone pieces. I could&#39;ve broken my teeth since it was so hard.Fried Squab - really dryOverall, currently not a bad place in Chinatown. Still not amazing but there aren&#39;t too many good restaurants in Chinatown these days to begin with.

I came here because I really wanted to eat rice, and they definitely delivered. It&#39;s a 10 minute walk from where I work so I was worried that I&#39;d be late getting back since my break is only 30 mins long. The lady scared me by saying it&#39;d take 15 minutes to prepare my food. I left for 5 minutes, and when I came back they were ready, and I also got complimentary soup.I think ordering fried rice or anything that you&#39;d see served in Panda Express from a Chinese restaurant is shameful, but I definitely don&#39;t regret my decision. The BBQ pork fried rice I got was huge, and only $6. The rice is saturated with flavor from the other ingredients it was cooked with (plus MSG probably) and so good. Sadly, after drinking the entire mini bucket of soup, I was too full to eat more than a quarter of the rice. But happily, that means leftovers!

We decided on this restaurant based on great Yelp reviews. It was very tucked away, keep an eye out for their address on their door as the restaurant is above a store. There are probably a dozen family size tables that seat 8 ish with a lazy Susan&#39;s on the tables to share entrees. Big windows that look down onto Grant Ave. The menu has a hundred choices all easy common Chinese dishes the kids could pick for themselves. A dozen soups to choose from too! The server was very helpful, attentive and polite. Which was much appreciated with our large family. The place was kept very clean and the food was served SUPER QUICK AND HOT!

The Duck Clay Pot was a bit low on duck meat and a bit too oily for all those who are cholesterol conscious.

You typical tradition Cantonese Chinese restaurant, this is the joint that all the locals went to eat when they grew up here. The food is excellent, but not the best I have ever had. There is always someone better out there. The food was good and EXTREMELY reasonably priced, a fresh live Dungeness Crab is only $20, which other restaurants on Pier 39 would easily charge $40 for. We had a feast of 3 for only $80, we could barely get up and walk after we ate all of the food. The duck tongue was an awesome appetizer, step out of your comfort zone and try something new and it might surprise you. The Braised Pork Belly was amazing beyond world, the pork belly just melts in your mouth. The clay pot beef is so flavorful, mixed in with vegetables, tofu and spices. I wasn&#39;t too sure about the black bean calms, but they were still good. You can&#39;t go wrong eating at Hong Kong, however, but willing to wait for a table, it might be awhile because it&#39;s a small restaurant.

After walking everywhere in SF, my little bro and I decided to just get some Chinese food in good ole Chinatown! I mean... you can&#39;t go wrong with Chinatown Chinese food, right? Plus, every restaurant dubbed &#34;a hole in the wall&#34; has been delicious, and this one was no different.Walking through Chinatown, this restaurant literally is a hole in the wall. We missed it the first time we walked by! You have to go up a narrow staircase to get to the restaurant upstairs. Like every Chinese restaurant, you always get perks when you can speak Mandarin/Cantonese. Good thing for us, I spoke Mandarin, and my little bro spoke Cantonese! ;) Service was good - all the servers were super friendly and fast to serve. We ordered two dishes to share. The Honey Walnut Shrimp was really the bomb diggity! (Thanks to all the Yelp reviewers who raved about this dish!) It looked awesome in pictures, too! Of course, since it&#39;s a clay pot restaurant, we ordered the beef and tofu clay pot. The beef was so tender and the dish was flavorful. Every bite was flavorful. Although I complained a lot about how much walking I did, I was so happy we ended our day with this restaurant.

Kinda wish i could give this place 3.5 stars, but if I had to lean one way I&#39;d lean towards a 3. I got the tofu hot pot, which came with fried tofu, bok choy, and mushrooms in a watery sort of sauce. The mushroom actually had a great flavor to it, but the bok choy and tofu didn&#39;t have that much taste to them. This place is pretty cheap, open late, and takes credit cards - all pluses.On a side note, its kind of hard to find - look up the address, and remember that it&#39;s up on the second floor (and the sign to the entrance is in Chinese).

Ask for white or steamed tofu instead of braised tofu when you get any of the clay pot dishes. It&#39;s &#34;healthier&#34; and that tofu is just so much better.The snow pea sprouts with garlic is delicious!!!The ginger &amp; green onion crab is AMAZING. Why spend $50 on a flavorless dungeness from Thanh Long when you can just come here and get a well-seasoned, hearty crab dish for about $20-25 (seasonal).The servers are all extremely friendly, and the demo for this place is a really good mix of tourists &amp; locals

Service here is always a little patchy but I guess given that there was just 2 servers that is to be expected. It&#39;s not any worse than most other Chinese restaurants I&#39;ve been. The food is great. I really liked the beef stew. I also like the walnut prawns. However this time, I suspect that the prawns were as fresh or as clean as I broke out in hives after. I didn&#39;t the last time I ate here. Might be something in addition to that triggered it but usually it&#39;s unclean shellfish that triggers my allergies. I would still come back here but I might be more careful about ordering seafood the next time.

Clean, friendly, and authentic enough. Easy-to-read, diverse menu. My braised tofu was the winner in my group of five. Order a side of rice with it and be aware: it&#39;s super tasty but not healthy (some may find it greasy).Chicken fried rice lacked meat; go for something more adventurous. Soups were out of control! One order is easily enough to share with 3-4 people as an appetizer.Not a traditional dim-sum spot.Bottom Line: Good (safe) choice for lunch in Chinatown.

Hong Kong Clay Pot is your typical hole in the wall Chinatown restaurant. Once you find the entrance under the easy to miss sign, you make your way up stairs that leave you wondering what you&#39;re getting yourself into. Once inside, it&#39;s a simple room with a good amount of tables and minimal decorations.I got an Abalone &amp; Chicken Clay Pot, which comes with the two ingredients and onions drenched in sauce. An excellent dish that&#39;s packed with flavor. The abalone is tender and adds a nice contrast to the chicken. This dish lasted me for 2 more leftover lunches along with rice. For under $10, that&#39;s a fantastic deal.Workers are all friendly, but service is slow. Didn&#39;t expect anything more than that in the first place, though. You&#39;ll see a mix of locals and tourists, but that&#39;s expected in the heart of Chinatown.A nice and simple choice for a quick lunch. These guys know how to do their clay pots right.

We were visiting San Fran and tried this place out because it had better reviews than other places. Quick seating and food was delivered quickly. We ordered pot stickers, Mongolian Beef, and Kung Pao Chicken. Pot stickers were ok but we enjoyed the beef and chicken. Both were on the spicy side. If you look like a tourist (which we were) they will give you the regular menu that&#39;s much more expensive. Make sure and order off the lunch/specials menu. It&#39;s 1/2 the cost!

Definitely a four star for dirty cheap food.Tried their clay pot lamb, tasty and tender lamb chunks with skin, made just the way it should be. Shrimp paste potato leaves is also done very nicely, only a little on the oily side.A nice gem in Chinatown. It is on the second floor and the entrance is kind of obscure.Thanks fellow helpers for leading me here.

A nice find in Chinatown. Service was initially a little slow, but once we ordered, the food came out quickly. Would recommend the potstickers and the hot and sour soup, and if you&#39;re vegetarian, the tofu clay pot was delicious

The night before, I had taken my parents to a slightly more upscale Japanese restaurant hoping to impress. Yeah, I should&#39;ve known better.In their minds, cheap + tasty = very good. expensive + tasty = only okay.Well, lesson learned. Day 2 brought us to Hong Kong Clay Pot Restaurant.Knew I was sold when I read on Yelp that it was full of Cantonese families. We may be Taiwanese, but we can blend in.Sure enough, we walked up the stairs to the resaturant and knew we were in the right place. A little dingy, a little questionable, and full of Asians? Score.Plopped ourselves down and started ordering. Think we got the oxtail clay pot. And the live fish cooked two ways. The fish was such a good call -- it actually came with 2 dishes + a soup (the base), so my parents were thrilled with the economical value of it all... Remember, folks, they are easily impressed with all things cheap. In general, though, the food was pretty darn delicious.End of the day, my dad declared the meal to be infinitely better than the Japanese restaurant from the previous night.And it was probably less than a third of the cost.From now on, I&#39;m saving the money I would&#39;ve spent on my parents and using it to buy myself a drink when they&#39;re gone. God knows I need it.

We had guests come in to town that wanted to visit the historic region of Chinatown. I sure made the wrong choice with this place. Service was so bad i was embarrassed. We were 1 of 4 tables and I still had to flag down the server...for everything even remotely reasonable of expectation. My advice for folks, if you need the experience of Chinatown and don&#39;t care that you&#39;re treated like a cattle car tourist, just be patient.

This was my first time in SF Chinatown with my family. Coming from Panda Express territory, I was surprised and delighted by Hong Kong Clay Pot.At first, the restaurant was difficult to find, until a man behind me poked out of a door, gave us a paper menu, and pointed the way up the stairs. The restaurant itself was not fancy, simply a small room overlooking Grant Street.We underestimated the portion sizes and ordered individually. When the food came out, it was clear by the serving spoons and rotating table center that we were meant to share the food family-dinner style. So we did.The food was very flavorful and mostly easy to pick up with chopsticks, save for the rice and broccoli stalks. I had never had Chinese food this authentic before, but the traditional dishes were surprisingly tasty, even for the picky kids. The free tea was also pretty decent, so I didn&#39;t have to order a drink.Overall, in comparison to the fast food and take-out Chinese I&#39;ve had previously, this was probably the best Chinese food I&#39;ve ever had.

This is a no-frills kinda&#39; place. If you&#39;re looking for a fancy experience--don&#39;t come here. But if you&#39;re looking for great food and warm service, come here.We had the Kung Pao Chicken, the BBQ Pork Fried Rice, and the Wonton Soup. Everything was delicious. We also especially liked that we received complimentary tea upon arrival. I believe it was Jasmine tea... it was so delicious (and that says a lot since I&#39;m not a big tea drinker). The Wonton Soup was great!I&#39;m a tourist and this restaurant was not a touristy spot... and I liked that.

Blink and you might miss this place. No, really - it&#39;s pretty non-descript. Clay pot was calling me though and since they have clay pot here, my friend and I stopped in. I must say everything we ordered was tasty. I ordered the vegetarian clay pot with tofu. It was served hot with rice. I can&#39;t remember what my friend ordered but we didn&#39;t spend a lot. I ended up with lots to take home as well.Not sure what else to say besides this is a pretty run of the mill Asian restaurant with lots of people in it.

Chinatown can be rather unpredictable.While people are killing, pillaging, and robbing/pushing/shoving each other, and trading in their first borns over half priced flatscreen TVs during Black Friday sales, Golden Gate Bakery on the other hand had no lines whatsoever. It could also be the fact that GGB just re-opened from a long random vacation, and since those mofos are not on Twitter or FB or instagram, nobody can predict when they might open again until word of mouth spreads.And Hong Kong Claypot Restaurant, you know...the place right across Ten Ren on Grant, up a flight of stairs, can be fairly empty right before 6 pm Saturday night after Black Friday, yet the moment you sit down, hoards and hoards of Toishanese families flood in, and then people are waiting by the entrance and on the stairs.HK Clay Pot Restaurant does not offer Hong Kong style bo jai faan (claypot rice), and their claypot entree selection is modest to a bit on the generic side to be honest...nothing that really screams real ass Hong Kong. So what is the hoopla with this place?It&#39;s all about the price to performance ratio. If you want fancy schmancy, there&#39;s Great Eastern and R&amp;G Lounge (which is of generally better quality, at a premium). HKCPR is a much more affordable alternative, with a big value proposition, hence the family popularity factor.Small white board of specials in Chinese by the cashier area. On Saturday night, it listed:Garlic steamed pacific clams (gwai fei pong) with bean thread vermicelli noodles - one order comes two half shells, decent portion at $7. The secret is in the enhanced soy sauce. Crackalicious. Even better than Silver House in San Mateo...Which makes me wonder how decent their steamed fish might be.Sea cucumber and mushroom stewed with thick mustard greens - $18.95Some sort of squash/melon (sing gwa) with preserved meat slices - $8.50roasted squab ($12 per) - this was actually quite good, but not as sexay at the version at Yum&#39;s. And oh yeah, the translation is roasted, but dis chit is actually deep fried :-)steamed squab with lotus leaf - $12black bean sauce goose intestines - $12.95. Too bad not done Chiu Chow style...could potentially be some killer Chinese izakaya dish with Tsing TaoPickled veg with pork intestines - $7.95. Rustic with a hint of nastayLotus root stir fry with preserved meats and vegetables - $8.50Mixed mushrooms with fatty beef - $9.50So tourists and non Chinese peep$....do you think you are being kept in the dark by not knowing what&#39;s on the Chinese white board? Would you have gone for the goose intestines like I almost did (until I saw the black bean sauce prep...which isn&#39;t my style).It had to be a quickie meal, as we had no time to lose:complementary house soup - let&#39;s just say this was not very well refined, but it wasn&#39;t just MSG + H2O. The run of the mill Sunset or Outer Richmond area Cantonese restaurant can do way better. Free, so can&#39;t complain otherwisepacific clams - very nice, definitely better than what I had at Silver House and Cheung Hing in South SF. Can&#39;t beat fresh when materials can be easily sourced up the street along Stockton (produce, meat, seafood etc...just no frozen armadillo please).Roasted squab - quite nicely done as said before. Recommended.Oxtail clay pot - there&#39;s a reason why this is only $8.95. You go to any other nicer Cantonese restaurant, and an order of oxtail claypot (whether done red wine braised style or not), costs about the same as a Japanese style unaju/unagi over rice entree, plus or minus. Here at HKCPR, they have you 3 to 5 pieces of varying sizes (mostly small), and shove a bunch of tofu in there to take up space. The tofu was tasty, but the shitake mushrooms they put in there are dismally small. No red wine sauce, but mostly bean sauce based (like a miso without the fermentation). If you are hungry, this will do in a jiff.Stir fried large pea sprouts with garlic - A shade less than $10, which I suppose is a steal, since this entree easily goes for in the early teens. If you want all your food executed a bit more smoothly, request less salt and less oil for everything.We were the only non Toishanese customers (ie non locals or non Chinatown residents), plus 2 Caucasian customers (likely tourists). Everyone else around else were someone else&#39;s fam bam young and old. Probably the folks got sick of eating other people&#39;s turkeys a few nights ago and decided to feast on cheap decent quality old school chit. The table next to us had a short mountain pile of pacific clams from the specials...and that was just appetizer. No wonder these mofos also go gaga and googoo over the pacific clams when they come out at the Chinese steam table section at Kome sushi buffet (yet skip the dubious looking sashimi, &#34;geoducks&#34; and uni.For lunch this place is apparently quite ridiculous....several rice plate entrees hovering at the $5 mark (some below $5). Congee, and some noodles as well.

We ordered their beef clay pot. Given that the word &#34;clay pot&#34; was in the restaurant name, I was expecting deliciousness.What arrived on our table was the opposite. The beef was very sour. I couldn&#39;t even eat the dish. I called over the chef, and he offered to exchange the dish with something else (which was nice). I ordered the duck clay pot. This came out sour and the meat was dry.We also ordered the stir-fry pea shoots, and those were somewhat flavorless.I&#39;m not coming back.

Yelp steered us here because of its 4 star review. This restaurant is upstairs which is interesting, but its on touristy Grant Ave so I was skeptical.This place is decent, but I don&#39;t think I would come here again. We had to wait in line a bit which I definitely regret. We ordered the Seafood Pan Fried Noodle and the Shrimp Vermicelli Noodle Clay Pot. Both dishes were fine but nothing to write home about.Service was fine. It was quick and without hassle. When the check came, we asked if we could split the charge between 2 credit cards and our server said it was okay, but then she came back and told us she would charge $10 on each (even though our bill was under $20) and that we should add tip to that. I thought that was strange and forthright, but it&#39;s okay.I like that this place is authentic and that all the customers were families gathered around the round tables speaking Cantonese. I would perhaps try this place again to see why Yelpers give it 4 stars, but I wouldn&#39;t order the same dishes again. These dishes definitely can&#39;t be what everyone is so excited about.

The stairs leading up to HK Clay Pot can seem a bit sketchy...but once you walk up the stairs and into the restaurant, it&#39;s much cozier and less shady.We came on a Thursday evening after work and there were only 2 other occupied tables, which was nice for us as we were starving and were not in the mood to wait.We ordered the oxtail/tofu/mushroom clay pot, a side of Chinese veggies, and the lobster dish. All were great, especially the lobster. It was about 8.99/lb, which is actually super reasonable compared to other Chinese restaurants that charge upwar to 20.00/lb. The lobster meat was tender, but I do wish there was more meat in it.The oxtail clay pot was wonderful. The oxtail was soaked in so many amazing spices and fell right off the bone. Simply delicious.I normally am not a fan of veggies, especially Chinese veggies, but the veggies we ordered (forgot the name of it) was also great. I think it&#39;s because it was soaked in this melted bean curd, which made it nice and salty (but not overly salty).I would definitely come back again and check out other dishes. It&#39;s A-OK - not super awesome but definitely cheap and do-able.

We went looking for this place and walked by it four times without realizing it! It is a hard place to find. Look for the blue canopy and a yellow sign. You will know what I mean...trust me.All in all, deliciousness. We ordered a few of their of claypots and each one was oh so sexy. I especislly loved their lamb clay pot. They braised and slowcooked that sucker to death. The meat was incredibly tender and didn&#39;t have too strong of a game-y taste. Be careful. Claypots are like primitive slowcookers. It even cooked down the bones...A sign of a good Chinese restaurant is how well they can prepare staple dishes. We ordered my husband&#39;s favorite - beef chow fun. They knocked it out of the park. Not at all greasy. No signs of using msg. Tender and flavorful beef. Lots of sauce and onions!This place is pretty authentic and I would recommend people coming here if they are visiting Chinatown. We ordered six dishes and they were all cleared by the the time dinner had ended. No boxes needed! When five Asians sit in silence eating, you know it&#39;s got to be good.

Thank you Yelp for this hole in the wall find!This place was our first meal in San Fran after a long flight. We first tried to go to R&amp;G, but after hearing that the wait was over an hour, we decided to find another option. We would&#39;ve never found this place, since the signage outside is small, and you have to go upstairs to find it. But once we saw how busy it was (but not too busy that we weren&#39;t willing to wait), we decided to stay. And when you see a bunch of Chinese people eating at a Chinese restaurant, you know that you can&#39;t go wrong.We were feeling piggy and ordered a lot of food: ginger crab, beef clay pot, seafood clay pot, and onchoy.The ginger crab was just right. The portion was small, but for the price it was great! ($16, I believe?) We probably could&#39;ve just gotten one clay pot, but we were greedy to try more dishes. Since clay pot was part of the name of the restaurant, we figured it was a good bet. The seafood clay pot is made just the way I like it: loaded with various seafoods and fried tofu. Yummers! The beef clay pot was not bad, but I probably won&#39;t order it again. The cuts of beef aren&#39;t very great, and the flavor of the sauce wasn&#39;t as good as the seafood&#39;s. It also came with tofu... we were actually tofu-ed out after eating both clay pots. The onchoy is cooked just right, no complaints.I would come here again. It&#39;s got a total mom &amp; pop&#39;s feel. We were actually the last table to finish eating, and the restaurant staff started eating while we were finishing up. It looks like a family business- brothers, wives, and a teenage daughter. The food was totally comfort. I would come here again, especially since the prices are really good!

First off, we really enjoy Panda Express which is why we rated this place one star because apparently we really love fake Chinese food and not authentic Chinese food. We thought we&#39;d try and be adventurous so we ordered spicy jelly fish for our appetizers. As soon as the plate arrived, one of us had instant regret. It was disgusting. They looked like cold slimy onions with the consistency of gummy worms. We also ordered kung pao chicken and the seafood clay pot which were bland. Upside, if you order 7-up, you will be served with a can of 7-up for $1.50 even though the menu says $1.35.Also, we didn&#39;t have high expectations as far as customer service goes but the servers seemed to have forgotten about us a few times. People who arrived after us had their orders taken before us and also received their food before us. We still had fun there but we will be sticking to Panda Express from now on.

Chinatown is always my favorite area to go when I&#39;m craving legit asian food, and never go expecting amazing customer service or a beautiful interior. I came across this place and read about their Salt and pepper crab. I was a little disappointed when I found out that the price had raised from $16 to $19. It was a bit too salty for my liking yet I ended up taking it home and eating it the next day and it was just right. Nothing too special or horrible about this place. Knowing that I have other favorites in the area, not sure if i&#39;d come back.

Thank you Yelp, you never fail me even when I&#39;m out of town.I was hungry and hiking through Chinatown. I already had this place bookmarked and my trusty Yelp app told me it was closeby. I looked at my map and looked around me, there were crowds of tourists walking by me and cars crawling by...and it took me a good three minutes to figure out the entrance to Hong Kong Clay Pot was about 5 feet behind me. The entrance is that small and when you climb the narrow stairway up a flight you arrive at a hunble mom an pop establishment with some pretty awesome food.Try the honey walnut prawns. It&#39;s not too sweet and overdone like that PF Changs crap.Be adventurous and get a clay pot dish. I had the duck it was pretty tasty.Maybe I was thirsty but the hot tea was great.

As my lady said, if the name calls out their specialty, get it. Their seafood clay pot was mind-blowing. We also got the house fried rice, pot stickers, and honey walnut prawns. Our total bill was ~$35. We had to roll out of there with how full our bellies were. If you&#39;re in Chinatown, this is one of those legendary hole-in-the-wall places to write home about!

First, let&#39;s preface this with the situation. Chinese New Year parade had just ended, the streets were slammed with people, and lines were everywhere. Based on the review, we decided to patron this place.There was a line into the restaurant, one which we were happy to stand in...until some snarky folks just started busting in front of everyone. The waiters had their hands full, but still...not ok. There was no system to put your name down. Gripe 1.Gripe 2 is directly related to our food. We ordered a smattering of things, none of which hit the mark. In fact, even the dish we&#39;d read about most, the honey walnut prawns, were disappointing. Our order was incorrect, the clay pot was disappointing, and it was only the mound of green beans that were relatively good.We ordered, in all: green beans, lamb clay pot (which morphed into an ox tail clay pot, somehow), clam soup, and honey walnut prawns. I would eat none of them again, and I won&#39;t be returning.The good: Family-style dining, getting to know some other folks.The bad: The foodThe odd: plastic party cups for water.

I would definitely recommend any of their clay pot dishes. Basically, we ordered a bunch of dishes and we found that the clay pot quail was the best of the lot.The place is generally noisy and had a rich delicious smell around.It is a little hard to find, keep your eyes peeled. It is on the first floor.

Among the worst Chinese food I&#39;ve ever had. Lousy service.I was a bit shocked at how unfriendly the service was. Quite strange that our potsticker appetizer came out third, and the order of each item came out totally randomly.As a sweet &amp; sour pork enthusiast, I was incredibly disappointed. I know there is better food in Chinatown. I just know it.Yelpers failed me today, which is crazy. It doesn&#39;t happen often.

I was craving salt and pepper crabs, but didn&#39;t want to pay the premium at R&amp;G Lounge. I was disappointed that although they advertised crabs for 19$, they didn&#39;t have the inventory. However, I was able to substitute the crab with lobster (not on menu although ginger lobster is). The lobster was on the small side, but was tasty and satisfied my cravings for deep fried shellfish.Other dishes that I have tried:1. tofu clay pot - comes with Bok choy, shittake, and tofu. Highly recommended!2. Hot and sour soup - really spicy and flavorful3. Salt and pepper cod - crispy and well made, but too much salt was added.4. Kung pao shrimp - don&#39;t get it. Too salty and shrimp was over cookedDecor is typical of Chinatown- a little run down and restaurant was hard to find. Service was whatever, but prompt.I love their deep fried salt and pepper lobster and will be back to try the crabs once they are in season. Other dishes are decent and you really can&#39;t beat the prices here. I would avoid overly-Americanized dishes such as the Kung pow, sweet and sour stuff that cater primarily to tourists.

True hole in the wall place that gives you authentic Cantonese food. You of course need to have the clay plot dishes -- I highly recommend the lamb one as well as the tofu one. The house special fried rice is basically yang chow fan and is quite delicious as well. They give you free soup and dessert which make the whole experience that much better. The potstickers are only okay but can hit the spot if you are dying for some.Come early cause it does get crowded.

Yum. Yum x 1000.I came here on a whim with a friend on a random Tuesday night. The restaurant is located in the heart of Chinatown and you have to walk up a flight of shifty stairs to get to there. Open arriving at the front of the restaurant, we saw a mini sea (so like, a lake) of Asian people eating dinner. One white couple. So I knew we had hit the authentic Chinese hot spot for food.We ordered a fish and tofu clay pot which was GREAT. So yummy and extremely filling. The portion was also gigantic.Since the person I was with was a little more &#34;white&#34; than me, we ordered BBQ fried rice and hot and sour soup - both which were above par for Americanized Chinese food.The service and ambiance were mehhh. In fact, the table was pretty gross when we got there and was only wiped down by another dirty rag. But what do you expect in a Chinatown restaurant? The waitress was normal - not rude, not super friendly... but she was actually friendlier than most chinese restaurants I&#39;ve gone to. She did say they preferred cash but took 2 credit cards with no complaints.BTW, anyone complaining about the prices.. get real. Seriously. How is 8 dollars too expensive for a crap ton of food? I know it&#39;s Chinese food and it CAN be like 5-6 bucks but really, it&#39;s not that much.I know this restaurant passed the test for me because I would be willing to bring my super Chinese, super judge-y parents here for dinner. That&#39;s the true testament to a good, authentic, chinese restaurant.

Pro: Good food and cheap lunch menuCons: A very long wait and slow serviceIf you are a tourist or local who has plenty of time to spend on eating, come here. If you don&#39;t have time to spend and would rather see more things in one day while you are in SF, don&#39;t bother coming here.Don&#39;t get me wrong, the food is really good and the price is very affordable during lunch time, but the wait is ridiculous. It took us about 45 mins to get a table and another 45 mins to get the food. The service is really slow as there were only 2 servers.

We arrived at the Hong Kong Clay Pot Restaurant at about 12:30 PM on a weekday and it was packed, so I recommend stopping by after 1:30 PM, which is when the place began to empty out.We ordered the Honey Walnut Prawns, Sweet and Sour Chicken, Pot Stickers, Chow Mein with Pork, and white rice. The prawns were very good, but my only disappointment regarding this dish was that I was expecting bigger sized prawns. The dish consisted of deliciously glazed prawns, with little walnut pieces scattered neatly around them on the plate. Very yum. The pot stickers came with a VERY delicious dipping sauce that had the perfect kick of spiciness, yet not too hot, which made it perfect for people like me who don&#39;t like super-spicy foods. It hinted slightly of tamarind, with a bit of other delicious ingredients. The sweet and sour chicken was pretty ordinary, nothing super-exciting. I enjoyed the chow mein&#39;s clean flavor, a huge difference from typical places such as Panda Express, which saturate their chow mein in oil, thus losing it&#39;s flavor.In sum, I would say the food was pretty good.

I came down here for lunch on a Friday on the first week after New Year. It&#39;s full of people here. Luckily we got seated right away.My coworker and I shared two dishes (scrambled eggs with prawns and chicken tofu claypot). Both dishes taste great although the eggs are quite oily. I&#39;m slightly disappointed they don&#39;t serve claypot rice dishes here. Note the claypot dish takes a while to cook.It&#39;s a generous portion for the price you paid (of course we&#39;re in Chinatown). Their lunch menu is less than $5 (WOW). They definitely use MSG here, but you can tell them not to add it in your food.

I ended up here on Thanksgiving day because:1. It was open2. It was near my hotel3. The Yelp reviewsThe kids and I celebrated TG at my brother&#39;s house a few days later on Saturday, so don&#39;t think I&#39;m a weirdo for having my Thanksgiving meal here. My sixteen year old son did NOT want to proceed up the grotey stairway to the entrance, but we did anyway. We were seated right away, and were the only non Asians in the place.It was a little noisy when we arrived at around eight o&#39;clock - I guess real Chinese people don&#39;t do the &#34;restaurant voice&#34; thing - but by the time we left the adults were downright loud and these cute little Chinese kids were running around and screaming like it was a playground, which didn&#39;t really bother me, but It was freaking my 16 year old son out, but I like it when that happens. A twenty something non-Asian showed up when we were waiting for our food, sat down for three or four minutes, was ignored and left. What a wimp!We had clay pot duck, salt and pepper crab and a vegetable dish the waitress recommended, but as she spoke no English I have no idea what it was. Bright green and tasty. The service was a little strange but quick. My son thought it was way too authentic and funky, but I loved it and would return again, and maybe try the deep fried duck tongues and the regular crab, which is what the staff was eating at the next table.

I read the reviews about the cheap lobster and had to try it out. I mean, who doesnt love cheap cantonese style lobster? I can eat 5 of them in one seating like some sort of savage.The service was a bit slow but I finally got the waitresses attention and ordered my lobster. Unfortunately it came out a bit undercooked and was not enjoyable. However, reheating the lobster next day the flavor was good and delicious..it would have been great to enjoy that at the restaurant itself.Overall, if you&#39;re in the area, spend the extra $$ and go to RG or Great Eastern... otherwise, this is a good poor mans option

This place has a tiny little entrance with stairs that lead up to the small restaurant. I thought it would be a lot bigger but instead, I walked up to what seemed like the size of a coffee shop.We arrived shortly after they opened for dinner and the place was full already. The waitress refused to give the 4 of us a bigger table and made us wait till a 4 seat table was available even though there were 2 bigger tables available already. We watched as other people who came in after us waltzed right into the seats at bigger tables. There was a family of 3 sitting at the bigger tables anyway.The service was subpar being that it was way understaffed. There were only 3-4 older women in their late 40s working there. We were sitting in front of the entrance and at one point, a family came in and stood there for 10 minutes before they were even acknowledged. Our waitress was the manager of the restaurant and she seemed a bit impatient while we ordered. She took 10 minutes to give us our check later on.The food was mediocre. The beef stew clay pot was a disappointment since it was mostly filled with tofu instead of actual beef. The beef was dry and tasteless.The sweet and sour chicken was hard and the vegetables we ordered were old.The place just felt filthy and rundown. The noise level in there was so high. The waitresses would shout across the room.There are plenty of other great restaurants to try out in Chinatown since this place does not live up to the hype. I will not be returning to this place when I&#39;m in town.I gave them an extra star because the waitresses were running around nonstop as they tried to attend to everyone&#39;s needs.

1. Hot and stuffy with two little fans to air out the incredibly crowded room. Needs ventilation.2. Slow service. Kinda rude. They don&#39;t acknowledge you when you walk in. You just stand and wait. The lady asked my husband to turn on the fan...and when we said he was too short, she said he could climb on the chair. There was a carseat there with my daughter in it, and it was extremely cramped. Not cool. Started ordering using numbers, and she rudely told us to give her the name of the dish and not numbers.3. Food was okay. Beef stew pot good. Beef chow fun salty with no real flavors. Peking spare ribs decent.4. We ordered fish. It never came. When we asked, the lady denied we ordered fish bc she never wrote it down. Seriously, I repeated it three times...and she still missed it.5. I don&#39;t understand why you have to ask for rice these days in Chinese restaurants! Why doesn&#39;t rice come with my dish!?!?

Had the beef chow fun, walnut prawns and beef tendon stew with my mum.The chow fun wasn&#39;t all that great -- the noodles clumped together too much and the beef was a bit chewy. I would characterize it as below average.The beef tendon stew was a big disappointment. The beef was so tough and chewy, I had to actually spit it out after 2 minutes of fruitless chewing. The sauce was good though and the tofu was silky on the inside and still held its shape well.The walnut prawns were the best of the bunch. The shrimp were a bit soggy, but compared to some other places that over battered the critters, it could be worse. There were plenty of honey walnuts on the plate so the crunchiness of the nuts made up for the sogginess of the shrimp and added texture.All in all, the food was average to below average. The place was packed though. I believe the restaurant is known more for its more exotic seafood. I saw some delicious things on other people&#39;s tables. Maybe I&#39;ll come back with more people and we can order some other dishes.

Have you ever eaten authentic &amp; good Chinese food while watching a man shave his face? Thanks to this restaurant, I can say I have!(Don&#39;t worry, the guy didn&#39;t have food on his table when he whipped out his razor and this wont deter me from coming back).I found this hole in the wall thanks to Yelp. We ordered several dishes, which were each pretty good, but what really stood out to me was:1) Honey Walnut Shrimp: same great flavor as other places, but without being drenched in the mayonnaise sauce. Possibly one of the best HWS I&#39;ve ever had!2) Congee: I normally loathe congee because it reminds me of the days when I was sick and this would be all my mom would allow me to eat, but this was actually really good! The consistency was perfect and it wasn&#39;t overly watery. Make sure you sprinkle in pepper!

...no clue why this place has such high ratings.We were looking for Chinese food on a Thursday night... stopped by R&amp;G Seafood and wow long wait even at 8pm! Ended up picking this place as one of the next highly rated Chinese restaurants.This place is NOT authentic, I&#39;ve definitely had better. We ordered honey walnut prawns which had chunks of mayonnaise on it... not to mention there&#39;s like 13 shrimps in the dish. Sweet and sour pork was just drowned in sauce... and onions were overused. Mushroom and sausage claypot was ridiculous... there were more onions than anything else, the flavor was again completely drowned out with onions. Deep fried rock cod had more batter than fish... it came out and I thought it was like frog legs or something... you couldn&#39;t even tell it was fish from the shape, let alone the texture. Lastly portion sizes were very meh... looking around other people&#39;s food looked good / decently sized, so maybe we ordered the wrong items, but I was very unimpressed... especially given the good ratings and this being in Chinatown.

My gf and I were supposed to go to The House for dinner, but they had no reservations until 9PM and we had a 10:30 flight out so that wasn&#39;t going to work. We got there and put our names on the list, but also looked around for other restaurants as they told us it was going to be an hour. Hong Kong Clap Pot was on the way back to our hotel, so we decided to give it a shot. I&#39;m so glad we did because their ginger lobster and walnut prawns were so phenomenal. You know it&#39;s a legit Chinese restaurant because it looks like all the ones back in Arcadia and Alhambra in LA. The usual clientele are Chinese speaking locals and the occasional yelp yuppies (like me). But the food is super reasonably priced and the tea is plentiful. Be sure to check it out if you&#39;re ever venturing through Chinatown.

It was a bit hard to find the restaurant because of the small entrance. Look for the blue canopy and a yellow sign. Don&#39;t let the entrance intimidate you! I walked up the stairs into a small, crowded restaurant full of local Chinese residents and tourists.The wait wasn&#39;t that long, however we had to wait long enough that a small line was created behind us. It might of just been a busy night. As we waited, I read the menu near the door. There was so much to choose from and it all looked amazing. I couldn&#39;t wait to sit down and finally eat!I noticed on the menu they had jellyfish and this really interested me. I ordered this, and this was the first time I would ever eat jellyfish. It was surprisingly good. The texture took some time to get used to, but after a while, I started to really like it. We also ordered fried rice, quail, and a few other dishes. They were not at all greasy. No signs of using MSG. All in all, the food was very flavorful and authentic. I would recommend people coming here if they are visiting Chinatown.All the workers were friendly, but the service is slow. This didn&#39;t make me mad because that&#39;s expected in the heart of Chinatown. I truly recommend Hong Kong Clay Pot, and if i ever get a chance to come back and taste their delicious food one more time, I would without a doubt.

This place had highly questionable quality of ingredients and lacked flavor in the food served.We ordered the oxtail clay pot and the walnut shrimp. The clay pot did not have much oxtail. It seemed as if the restaurant had a universal clay pot base and just dumped different types of meats in it. The sauce of the clay pot definitely did not have the gooey richness of slow-cooked ox tail. The walnut shrimp was abysmal. It was over-battered, over-sugared, and over-cooked.Overall terrible food and terrible ambiance. Given that it was right on Grant, I should have expected no better.

Second time here and was impressed. Clay pots are definitely the way to go here (hence the restaurant name) - ordered veggie and tofu claypots and fish. The fish was a tad overcooked, but decent.Overall the meal came with free soup (didn&#39;t seem to have MSG, but what do we know?), tofu claypot and steamed fish and rice, coming out to $30 before tax and tip for 2 people. Very reasonable for SF!

This place is well hidden on the second floor of the way too over-crowded touristy Grant Street in Chinatown, but the claypots are a treat. My personal favorite is the seafood claypot with calamari (very tender), fish, shrimp and fried tofu. This claypot has a ginger sauce that it cooks in which is just delicious.Great for large groups as well, so you can try as much as possible :)

This place was really good. Our table of 6 ordered various items from the menu that I don&#39;t even remember them all. BUT it was pretty eye opening for me because I tried a number of new items that are usually outside my &#34;safety&#34; zone. I always order Mongolian beef at any Chinese restaurant I go to. Of course this place was no exception. I love Mongolian beef and the beef here was very tasty and a good amount of spicy. It was really good even my fiance said it was his new favorite Mongolian beef. As I mentioned I did try some other items as well, and they too were good. I&#39;m not yet comfortable with ordering anything other than mongolian beef yet, but it was definitely a good start as the food was still really good.I also have to make a side note about the location of this place. It is in Chinatown, but totally awesomely located. We were meeting some people here and had we not had an address, would have missed it. There is a little hall that has stairs leading up to the 2nd floor. It was kinda cool cause it felt like we were going to some back room poker game.Anyway, the food was good! Try this place if you can find it!

The beef claypot was the best of the bunch.Didn&#39;t like : the cornstarchy sauces on everything and the seafood fried noodle was more bokchoy than seafood.Liked: the waitress serving us was nice.

After reading the poor reviews, I had to ask: &#34;Who in the world comes to a Cantonese restaurant and orders lamb?&#34; I was raised in Singapore and Saigon the first 12 years of my life, with frequent trips to Hong Kong, and though HK Clay Pot is not as good as it used to be when Bill owned it back in the 1990s and early 2000, (he moved back to Hong Kong when the City tax structures got crazy on restaurants): I would have given this place a full 5 stars if he was still in charge. And the who knows which chef is working the night you come in. If it&#39;s the good one, hallelujah! If not, well, just order the pot-stickers.Stay the hell away from the lamb: what are you thinkin&#39; if you think you know real Canto food??? You got problems with oil? It&#39;s friggen Cantonse cooking, people!Stay away from that Central China and Muslim Chinese main entree of lamb, and instead order the seafood, chicken and pork dishes. Crabs great: and pick and choose how you want it prepared. Just because it&#39;s not listed prepared that way on the menu, ask if you can have it another way. Fried sole is great. So&#39;s the jellyfish. And don&#39;t be a &#34;white ghost&#34;, even if you are ethnically Chinese, but actually born and raised in San Fernando Valley...in other words, dont&#39; act like a tourist: Make sure they give you a cold plate with the sliced meats along with that jellyfish and pickled veggies.Frankly, as one who resides with walking distance down the hill for a quick dinner at HK Clay Pot, I&#39;m hesistant about saying how good it can be for such incredibly cheap prices...at the same time sad that Bill&#39;s no longer running this ship and keeping the chefs in line. But, hey, it&#39;s completely different town...And hey, if you speak Canto, even just few words (pickup a Lonely Planet Cantonese book, for chrissake), it does help: especially if you know to ask about the secret stuff they don&#39;t serve the guailos, and keeps them from serving the Americanized crap they give tourists...and if you plan to come here often, make friends with the servers: they will remember you, good or bad.

We were walking down Grant Street one day looking for a place to eat that wasn&#39;t too touristy/PF Chang&#39;s when I noticed a rather happy looking couple coming out of a doorway about 1/2 a block from us. As we approached the place we noticed a stairway leading up to ... the great unknown. Feeling adventurous we decided to ascend. Feeling even more adventurous I decided *not* to check the Yelp reviews in advance. :)The place was bustling with activity - always a good sign. The food was awesome and the ambiance was very much the hole-in-the-wall Chinatown experience we were looking for. Service was a bit abrupt, but unobtrusive. I think part of this is the language/accent barrier - just point and smile and be patient and you&#39;ll (usually) be OK.Lesson learned: always follow the happy people.

Pros: 1) Delicious Tofu Clay Pot with Tender Greens and mushrooms! Very robust &amp; flavorful; 2) Generous portion! 3) Moderate prices. Dish was $6.50, side rice, $1.25; 4) Fast service!Cons: 1) MSG, food had a healthy dose of it; if you&#39;re sensitive to it like I am, this is a factor to consider; 2) Tea was served luke warm; blech!! Asked for 2nd pot, which was hot. 3) rice tasted like it&#39;d been sitting out a bit too long. 4) Place could use a good cleaning. 5) Service with a smile would be nice.Bottom line: Pros were strong enough to make me want to come back!Food: 4 starsSpeed of Service: 5 starsFriendliness of Service: 2 starsAtmosphere: 2 starsCleanliness: 1.75 stars

Just placed order here....me like it thus far!!! If unafraid of younger, more local crowd and second floor walk-up, this place is for you!!Follow-up comment:Clay-pot contents were &#34;good-to-the-last-drop.&#34;I ate there twice when on business trip in Downtown San Francisco.Menu is bargain priced.Its an authentic Asian casual-dining experience.Tip: &#34;Closed&#34; on WednesdaysTip: street parking is hit or miss everywhere in Downtown San Francisco.

Found this place with the Yelp app while roaming the city. Oh my gosh! So good. An unlikely place that surprised the heck out of me. I&#39;m choosy about Chinese food as my friends parents home cooking cannot usually be topped. Well, think again...this is one if the few that could. Would suggest this to anybody. Don&#39;t let the surroundings scare you. You&#39;re in for a treat.

My friend and I came to this place because of the recommendation from Yelp however I was not impressed. The restaurant is located on the second floor of the main street in Chinatown. The food was middle of the road. The prices are good but the quantity is small so I guess you get what you pay for. We ordered the pan fried noodles with the honey walnut shrimp. Would I return to this place, most likely not.

Maybe we ordered the wrong things, but I didn&#39;t really like this place as much as others did.From yelp reviews, we got the Lamb in Claypot, but the meat in this dish reminded me more of pork belly than lamb. I did like the bean curd that came with this dish, though.We also got the Honey Walnut Prawns, which was tasty, but the shrimp was small and few. Not worth the $9.50 in my opinion.The Seafood in Claypot was pretty good, but again, not as much seafood as I was expecting. The sauce in their claypots are quite tasty, so maybe that&#39;s what people like about this place.One of our friends came late and ordered Chicken over Greens. For the most part, this dish was good, but I think the bok choy could have used more flavor.Overall, I would probably come here again to try other dishes to hopefully see what others are raving about.

Very authentic. My family wanted a place where only the locals go and this was it! We tried five dishes and they were all delicious. My son loved the honey walnut prawn.While the appearance of the restaurant was unassuming as you had to walk up the stairwell when you got there it felt like you walked right into a small restaurant in China. We also enjoyed that the staff spoke very little English which added to the charm. All in five dishes under $60----delicious and reasonable!

Dirty, greasy, MSG loaded low quality food and not very cheap. We saw the yelp reviews so gave them a try. Total fail. Only positive I can say is that the waitress was somewhat honest in admitting that everything non-veg had MSG. But then when we ordered only one of the two veggie clay pots, she basically forced us to order an additional dish (&#34;Two people and only one dish? You want another one!&#34; she said) Looking for the smallest item to order, we asked if she can make a soup that had beef without msg, she said yes, they&#39;ll make it from scratch, no problem. We should have known that of course she would say that just to get us to order. My husband and I are both allergic to MSG, I could tell that the soup was loaded with MSG with just one sip. We couldn&#39;t drink the soup that we didn&#39;t want in the first place. Our other dish had no MSG but it was just meh.

Ordered the salt and pepper crab and SO got beef with broccoli. As soon as we started up the stairs, we could tell/smell we were in for some good food. I must have looked like the most clueless white girl trying to eat the crab (actually trying to figure out how to eat it) but what I was able to eat was delicious. Very flavorful coating on the crab, even though I have no clue if I ate it properly. Hub said beef and broccoli was the best he&#39;s had in years.Apparently they do read minds-husband&#39;s must&#39;ve said, &#39;I can&#39;t use chopsticks; fork for me, please&#39; and mine must&#39;ve said, &#39;I need a billion napkins, please.&#34; He got a fork and I got a stack of napkins as big as my head, without even asking.Service a little slow at lunch, but friendly and food was tasty. Definitely would go back, next time I am in SF.

I read through the reviews, found the location on a busy Saturday night and was placed at large table with two other couples. Ok, communal seating, fine. I ordered 2 beers, steamed rice, salt and pepper shrimp, and a beef stew hot pot. I was served two beers and hot tea first. As the lady cleaned the table and the tea cups with the same dirty tag, I passed on the tea. Then 2 minutes later came a small plate of shrimp...ten minutes later, some rice, and then 5 minutes after that a beef stew clay pot. Very strange way of serving as the shrimp were cold by now. The shrimp we ok, much more salty than peppery, and the beef stew should be called tripe and tofu stew because that made up 80 percent of the dish. I&#39;ll definitely pass on this place next time in China town.

Talk about a hole in the wall! Almost literally!!! Passed it twice and didn&#39;t see it. Its just a set of stairs in between a few vendors. Look for it using the address! Once you get to the top of the stairs, you enter a small little restaurant. Very tight! but its authentic! Food was pretty good! The reviews on yelp were pretty accurate. I&#39;m not sure about the women&#39;s bathroom, but the guys was TINY.

Let&#39;s be honest. I&#39;m from Colorado, and one thing that we lack in good ol&#39; CO is a China Town. We have a few places in the Mile High City that are authentic, but nothing as quaint, and hidden-feeling as Hong Kong Clay Pot.The menu includes all of the typical favorites, and some things that I&#39;d like to try when I am back in China Town; spicy jellyfish and frog hot pot to name names. We got pot stickers, pork fried rice, sweet and sour chicken and spring rolls. It was all incredible.So, if you&#39;re feeling like an adventure, or if you just want some delicious Chinese snacks, take the stairs and you won&#39;t regret it.

Been wanting to come to this place in a while since searching for a new place to eat in Chinatown. I thought clay pot sounded delicious so I bookmarked this place. After some attempts of coming here (they close at 3pm and reopen at 5:30pm and they close on Wednesdays) the place was finally open for business when I came out here. Was supposed to come here with a friend but she had other plans but I decided to eat alone since I could not wait for another trip out here.I walked up those flight of stairs and the restaurant was to the right. The decor was pretty old fashioned. I thought it was pretty cute how they have some Christmas stockings up on the wall. Kind of a fusion. The atmosphere was nice and I really liked the view of Chinatown&#39;s Grant Avenue. I was seated for a table of one but the waitress brought me two menus. Okay, maybe she didn&#39;t hear me. As I was looking over the menu she brought me a pot of tea that looked like it wanted to overflow. I asked that I have just water instead and she brought me a kettle of hot water. I felt like they were trying hard to please customers that way and I thought it was a bit too much; I am just one person here.The prices are average for the clay pots but I thought it was a little too much for the entrees (for the tourists maybe?). I thought about getting the vegetarian clay pot but I had second thoughts. I wanted the regular Chinese sausage ones with chicken and mushroom in it. So that&#39;s what I got. A few moments later the waitress came back with a bowl of ginseng soup which was pretty nice. Then came the clay pot. I was a little disappointed when the waitress told me that the rice wouldn&#39;t be included in the clay pot because that&#39;s the best part! Anyways I had to settle for the rice not being at the bottom of the clay pot. The clay pot was mostly chicken, garlic, onions, followed by some slices of chinese sausages and a couple of mushrooms. It was fine until I realized how much oil there is in there. I actually felt uncomfortable with all that oil at the bottom of the claypot. It was a couple tablespoonfuls of oil in there! What&#39;s the point of them claiming they don&#39;t use grease (the sign was right in front of you when you walk all the way up the stairs) when they use that much oil in the food? Eww. So unhealthy. After I couldn&#39;t eat anymore I asked for the check and a to-go box to pack up the leftovers. (I know its oily but It&#39;s still food) The waitress came back with the check, the to-go box and a bowl of dessert. It was nice and &#39;sweet&#39; for those complimentary items which sort of makes up for what I was unsatisfied with. The bill came out a total of $11 something. I thought it was expensive. If I wanted chicken rice I could have gone up to Powell St. and got me a box of that with less than half the price and less oil. This is my first and last time here.PS: I think this is a touristy place hence the prices and other things.

Fried duck tongue? I&#39;m in!Ha ha ha. Came here with a friend the other night who insisted we walk from the SoMA to here for some legit Chinese food. He&#39;s from France, soo I&#39;ll excuse his use of cutlery, but overall I was pleased with his choice. We waited about 30 minutes for a table-the place was jampacked with families surrounding large round tables with piles of food spinning around on them. This scene alone told us the food would be worth the wait.Finally got a two-top and decided to order Broccoli Beef, Fried Duck Tongue (just for shits!), Sweet &amp; Sour Chicken, and soup. The tongues were a little gummy for me with an odd crunch, but the rest of the food was &#34;a-ok&#34;. I wouldn&#39;t say it was worth the wait but it was good. Maybe we ordered the wrong things, but I wouldn&#39;t go out of my way to go here. Luckily I had great company :)The atmosphere was nice-lively, smackdab in the heart of Chinatown, families and friends enjoying meals together-but the food was just mediocre.

I get sketched out a bit eating at certain places, especially Chinese food that smells like a pet store. This is not the case here; once you get up the stairs you walk into a smell of delicious food.

Ordered spinach with garlic, fish fillet and tofu in claypot, scallop dish. They served us frozen scallops of the worst quality and they come with a weird after taste. This place cooks food for American tastebuds. If you are used to real Chinese food don&#39;t bother walking up the stairs. After I told the waitress about the scallops, she told me to order something else next time... as if I am going to return to this place!!!

Atmosphere of a chaotic Hong Kong &#34;deli&#34; is what was enjoyable about Hong Kong Clay Pot. We arrived on a Sunday night around 8:30 looking for Dim Sum because this restaurant came up with &#34;Dim Sum&#34; in the search. The waitress said &#34;no more&#34; which I couldn&#39;t determine meant no more for the night or not an ordering option at this restaurant anymore.Regardless, I ordered garlic crab which was tasteless and the good standbys of spinach &amp; garlic, and Spring rolls. My friend order seafood chow mein which he said was scrumptious - my word, not his.The kitchen and wait staffs from this restaurant and I&#39;ll guess others piled in at this hour and ate mounds of food family style. We remained the only customers which gave us a rare experience of eating with locals.Food okay, but authenticity terrific.

I found Hong Kong Clay Pot Restaurant on yelp and made a reservation for a large group and was happy to find it was as I expected/hoped! This place is legit!For how difficult a group we were (some members were unfamiliar with authentic Chinese restaurants) they were absolute saints!The food was delicious (the duck in claypot was divine!), the menu was diverse and enticing, the jasmine tea was spot on, the prices were right, the service was very accommodating, and the atmosphere was genuine! Having been to Hong Kong, it was the first time in America I have encountered a Hong Kong restaurant that I feel truly represents restaurants in Hong Kong!Please bear in mind this place is authentic, and in Chinatown, so the service, food preparation, overall style etc. may not be as expected in the States - this restaurant is not for everyone. I also think we, a group of over a dozen people, were a bit overwhelming for them. I would only go there with a smaller group of people who are respectful and open to the fact you are going to a traditional HK restaurant.

We went here simply because we were hungry and near Chinatown. We Yelped for high rated restaurants and decided on this one.We weren&#39;t disappointed. I wish there were more than two of us so we could&#39;ve tried more dishes.Here&#39;s what we had: tofu hotpot, spicy beans with XO sauce, scallops with veggies and egg fried rice. While they were all very good, three items really stood out. The hotpot with tofu and mushrooms was really good. The spicy beans was especially delicious because the XO sauce was made with fermented shrimp paste - something I&#39;ve had before and was pleasantly surprised when it was made that way. But my favorite - maybe I was craving carbs after walking around SF all day - was the simple egg fried rice. I couldn&#39;t get enough. Just oily enough, just fried enough, just moist enough.I would definitely return and try out the other dishes.The ambiance was definitely that of a dive. You go up these carpeted stairs. Make sure you turn right. Turn left and you go into the men&#39;s bathroom. The people who were already there seemed like regulars and we felt like we walked into someone&#39;s dining room. People knew each other. That&#39;s a good sign, regulars. So all in all a very good experience. Check it out.

Have you ever tasted a burnt fortune cookie? It&#39;s a really bizarre thing, let me tell you. That aside, though...Honey Walnut Prawns were delicious (Thanks Yelpers!), but almost a little too sweet sometimes where the sauce sort of pooled. Good, just slightly crispy texture and served with a garnish of cilantro, which admittedly buttered me up a little. When it came out, I thought that it was a bit small, but it was actually a surprising amount. I really shouldn&#39;t have finished the plate, but daaaaaaang. Not wholly mind-blowing, but satisfyingly tasty.Jasmine tea was complimentary and delicious. Both people who served me were very kind. The dining room was bright and not very big, but the tables were large and spacious. I felt a little weird sitting by myself at a table meant for five people, but it didn&#39;t seem to be a big deal, so, woo!The place is pretty much only local Chinese folk, and I take that as a good sign... though it might be because the place is hard to find if you only speak English and don&#39;t know what you&#39;re looking for.I&#39;d give it 3.5 stars if I could, but I&#39;m rounding up to 4 because I just got a good vibe all around.

Hole in the wall indeed! But what in Chinatown is not?That said, my experience here was pretty awesome. It was funny and freaky that the 6 people I bumped into the restaurant heard about this place through Yelp too (Good job, Yelp!).Food is good, 4 stars good. It&#39;s a busy establishment and you can&#39;t take personal the way you are treated once you are inside. They busy and are trying to get things done, so they may not pamper you as you may like them too. That said, the service is good.Probably my favorite thing about this place is the community table my girlfriend and I were sat at. We had the opportunity to meet some really cool people from different walks of life. It&#39;s a great idea!Prices are not as cheap as you would think for a restaurant in China town, but they are comparable being that you&#39;re in SF.

Chinatown SF can be a scary place if you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re doing. The place is surrounded by filth--just look up in the apartments above all the restaurants and stores. Thanks to Yelp, I never got sick on the food. We ate here for lunch one day. I&#39;d say it was the best lunch we had in Chinatown.My Hubby got the Kung Pao chicken--awesomely flavored and delicious. I had the honey walnut prawns (yum) with a side of perfectly cooked, perfectly sticky steamed rice. We were also served a full pot of jasmine tea. The shrimp tasted fresh---it wasn&#39;t SUPER fresh with that amazing &#34;sweet&#34; taste, but it also didn&#39;t taste fishy. I was very pleased with the sauce. It was extremely filling and cost $7.95.The servers were nice enough. The bathroom left a little to be desired--the sink looked like it hadn&#39;t been cleaned in a while--yellow spots and hair on it.The restaurant is decorated pretty tacky, but it added to the experience. I would say to go here for a no-frills traditional delicious Chinese meal.

Wow!This is a fully Chinese experience! The restaurant is as authentic as a Chinese restaurant can be out of China. Pretty much everybody was Chinese there. Ok, let&#39;s say 90%. The foods are either exotic or authentic, given that the serve frog (among other things). The food is tasty, the portions big, and the more people in your group, the cheaper the price is.Additionally everything is clean, which is something that I value a lot because my previous experiences with Chinese restaurants have not been very nice.

This is a hidden gem, literally. Tucked in between two Chinatown junk shops up a set of dingy stairs, and absolutely wonderful. My family of four ordered hot and sour soup, potstickers, fried quail, two clay pot entrees, and honey walnut prawns. It was all delicious, but the standouts were the Chicken Tofu Clay Pot and the Honey Walnut Prawns. Wow!

Yes, we could have been more adventurous...but it was all so delicious! We did notice that all the white people tended to sit in 4-top tables by he windows while the chinese families sat at the big round group tables with the lazy susans in the middles.

This place caters to more tourists than locals, but that&#39;s okay. My friends and I stopped by Hong Kong Clay Pot last Saturday during the Autumn Moon Festival (wanted to get off the street from all the crowds); the guy at the front door was amusing, giving us a thumbs-up and saying &#34;Good stuff!&#34; in his thick Chinese accent.Ascend a staircase and then, the restaurant appears--small, on the second floor, but seems to seat a decent amount of people. Service was so-so, but I expect that at most Chinese restaurants (it&#39;s all a different culture after all; that&#39;s how &#34;my people&#34; roll). Lunch specials were served on the weekend, thank goodness! The rice plates are served family style, so be sure to choose a mix of meat and vegetable plates if you are dining with someone else. My friends and I made the mistake of all ordering meat dishes...so in turn, we had to share three meat dishes. I felt I lacked the nutrients from vegetables in that meal.I probably will not go back to this restaurant, not because I disliked it, but because I rarely frequent the Grant Avenue part of Chinatown. Too many tourists; already have to deal with them while working in Union Square. /tangent

Very authentic and cool experience. Not fancy at all which is what we were searching for. Wife had the lobster with garlic l, she loved it. I had hot and sour soup (fantastic) and lamb clay pot. Sauce in pot was great but the lamb was mostly bone and fat. Actual meat in the pot was great.In summary, low end dive with good food. Would not order same pot again but would definitely visit again when back in SF.

After all these years of living in San Francisco and not really spending quality dining-time in Chinatown, I now have THE place to go, and it&#39;s Hong Kong Clay Pot Restaurant. I think that this is the most authentic Chinese food that I&#39;ve ever eaten. We tried each food group; fish, meat, vegetables and tofu, and each one was pretty darned tasty.It&#39;s a fairly small restaurant on the second floor, narrow staircase opens up to a large room with multiple family-style tables with gigantic Lazy Susans in the middle (why do they call them Lazy Susans?). The place was packed with several birthday celebrations going on and we had to wait about 10 minutes for a table. You can easily end up on one of the family style tables with assorted other diners, but we ended up getting a nice window table for just us two.Just remember to be patient once you sit down. Things can get pretty hectic with all the hustle and bustle of hungry people.....and it&#39;s well worth the wait. Chinatown here we come.

Had dinner here one evening while looking for the &#34;Chinatown experience.&#34; Well, this place delivered.We started with the pot stickers and wonton soup which were both just about perfect (maybe it was my extreme hunger talking). My boyfriend ordered the lobster in clay pot which was quite tasty (the noodles were a nice touch). However, I got the lamb in clay pot which was a mistake. I guess you could say it was a little *too* authentic, as it had lamb stomach and all the other bits. I should have thought a little bit more before ordering it (I did say we were looking for the &#34;Chinatown experience,&#34; right?) but it&#39;s all good. I just stuck with the lobster, and I was fine. Service was super slow, but that&#39;s to be expected. If I ever go back, I&#39;ll order something else.

We were window shopping and souviner shopping on Grant Avenue in Chinatown. With the help of Yelp, we found HKCP. The service was friendly and attentive. The fried quail appetizer was cooked perfectly! Yum! We also enjoyed the sauteed clams w/ginger. The curry chicken clay pot was ok, I was looking for a little more curry flavor. All in all a very positive experience for a VERY reasonable price!

Best CHINESE FOOD in SF Chinatown. If you haven&#39;t been here, you&#39;re really missing out! They have the best bittermelon and your choice of meat with black bean sauce! Great salted peppered fried chicken wings! Great chinese spinach! Just try everything, I&#39;m pretty sure you&#39;ll be satisfied.Go during their morning hours and until 3pm hour, they have special prices for certain dishes. It&#39;ll be worth it. About 4.75 or something for a nice portion on a plate. If you order three dishes, it&#39;ll be good enough for 3-4 people.

Came Sunday evening just after they opened for dinner service. Place was empty so no waiting required. Ordered the duck claypot, catfish claypot and the spinach with garlic. All delicious home style authentic chinese cooking. Lots of bones in the catfish claypot but otherwise it was all good.Ambiance was typical chinese with lots of the wait staff yelling at each other in full blown cantonese. ohh my ears...

Again with the Chinese restaurants, one day after my fabulous dinner at Jade Garden, I came here who is also another great restaurant! I initially chose this place because of the great reviews by the yelpers, but I guess what really closed the deal was that the restaurant is owned by one of my former cadet&#39;s family.We came here as a party of 18 with reservations ahead of time because of our connections, nah they treat everyone the same! Haha, well imagine a bunch of rowdy Chinese kids in a nice restaurant, the hell of it.There is an average flight of stairs leading you up to the restaurant itself and everyone was ready as they said it would be. We actually came here for dinner, not really expecting much but for a good time.We were immediately greeted by the boss, and she was very kind to us and served us with great speed. We chose the family dinner for 8 for both the tables, which was $88. So that&#39;s about $11 per person.The family dinner consisted of a broth, chicken, catfish, peppered pork, honey walnut shrimp, crab, lobster, beef, vegetables, and dessert. It was definitely worth it!Because I am Chinese, none of this is new to me, but I can safely say that all my team members had a great time and definitely ate their money&#39;s worth.Will definitely have to come back for another team dinner!

3.5 starsTotally a legit place to eat in Chinatown. Ben and I came here on Friday Night after combing the stores on Grant Street. The service is kind of shoddy, for instance, the old man forgot to bring us tea until about 15 min. later when i asked and even then he seemed cranky to bring it to us. Part of the charm of eating in a chinese resturant I think haha.We tried ginger crab and the tofu chicken clay pot. Both were delishhhhhcious! Its up in the cuts, but also, part also part of the &#34;charm.&#34;Left with happy full bellies. Parking is non-existant but at night time can be found within 6 blocks.

When I walk into a Chinese restaurant, I could see how the hostess might want to run into the kitchen and switch out the chopsticks for forks, suggest a sweet and sour chicken for my bland Western palate and dust off the Fortune cookies.It&#39;s understandable and thoughtful, but for my family not necessary. They&#39;ve all lived in China and were a little insulted to be pegged as frequenters of Panda Express. As if! We were the only folks gifted with fortune cookies at the end of the meal, for instance and on another occasion when we ordered a clay pot were told we wouldn&#39;t like it.Regardless of the hand-holding, in my opinion, the food is great and it&#39;s also really cheap. Two things, when combined that get high marks in my book.

This place was a 4 star on food and value, but lost points in other key areas:Service - Although she was prompt, she was not friendly, did not smile, and walked up to the table chewing food twice.In addition, I bit down on a staple in my tender greens, most likely from the vegetable&#39;s packaging. If I had swallowed it, I could have seriously jacked up my insides.I wish I could give a better rating because the food was very tasty, the tea was perfect and to get lunch specials for only $4.60 is insanity!

After reading reviews wanted to give this place a try. From the reviews I was expecting worse in everything but the food quality. It&#39;s not the nicest place, but looks clean and is alright. The place was almost full but wasn&#39;t really loud. Able to have normal volume convo with the other four people at my table. Waiter was nice and service was good. Real friendly staff.I got the seafood in clay pot and really enjoyed it. Friends got pan fried noodles with chicken and kung pow and it was also very good. Really decent prices. Went out for coffee and dessert somewhere else after this and spent the same amount there as I did here. I live close by so I will return and try new dishes. I think I found my new go to place in Chinatown.

I was told by Michael C that this place has the best clay pots in Chinatown. Better than Bow Hon and better than most places in San Francisco. Given that he has been working in Chinatown for the last 30 years, I trusted him. There are no clay pots over rice here. It&#39;s just clay pots without the rice. You really shouldn&#39;t call it Hong Kong Clay Pot then. You should call it Hong Kong Clay Pot without the riceThe food is really good here but like any Chinatown restaurants it is a bit on the hole in the wall, not as clean, borderline shady side. Overall the food is good and cheap.We orderedPork with mustard green with salted egg soup(the best I have ever had)Spicy Chicken wings (average)bitter melon and chicken with black bean sauce (if you are into this then this is very good)Oxtail clay pot (a bit tough but the tofu in it was great)black bean sauce clams ( one of the best sauces I have ever had)Total bill was 48 dollars.

This place is by far the best Chinese restaurant I have ever eaten at! We were in San Francisco for Labor Day week and we found Clay Pot via a search through Yelp. The reviews are spot on! So amazing and the price, you just can&#39;t beat it.My friend decided to order a highly reviewed item, the Honey Walnut Prawns....OH MY GOD!!!!!!!!! The best dish ever!!!!! My husband really wanted some salt and pepper squid, it wasn&#39;t on the lunch menu but our waiter said they&#39;d make it anyway. The best salt and pepper squid in the world!!! Sadly I can&#39;t remember the other two dishes ordered because it&#39;s been a while, but I know they were good. Clearly the Honey Walnut Prawns and the Salt and Pepper squid were the stars.I highly highly highly recommend going here on your next visit to Chinatown in San Francisco! You will not be disappointed!

We were on a city tour and someone had mentioned that she really enjoyed the food here. We yelped it and decided to come by here and eat before leaving back to Southern Cal. This place is very hidden. There&#39;s just a yellow sign and a door that has stairs that leads up to the restaurant. Walking in, it felt like you were walking into someone&#39;s studio (meaning someone&#39;s home). There were just 2 other tables that were occupied when we came. Since there were 6 of us...we decided to get the $88 for 8 people combo. We got there about 11:30. By the time we were done eating, the whole place was completely filled with people waiting to be seated. The food was good and the service was great. Definitely worth coming back and eating again when I&#39;m up in the Bay area.

One thing they had going for them was a packed house and a cool bustling atmosphere. I ate here with my family after watching the Chinese New Year Parade. Grant Street was packed with tourists and shop keepers peddling their wares. We were lucky in that we got a window seat to witness the exciting celebration while we ate.Overall the food wasn&#39;t horrible. I checked out Yelp before we ordered and saw what people were eating and writing good things about, unfortunately, I may have just ordered the wrong stuff. Considering the restaurant is named Clay Pot, I probably should have gone with some clay pot dish, oh well.I ordered the following:Honey Walnut Prawns: Honestly not very good. I have had MUCH better. This was a mistake to order in the first place. I was in the mood for steamed greens, and a nice cooked fish or something very basic/fresh/authentic...instead I went with a standard American Chinese Cuisine dish. The honey/mayo sauce was missing something and the Shrimp tasted like they had been freezer burned and boiled a long time to make them edible.Peking Sparerips: Very sweet candied meat. Again, I should not have ordered this int he first place, not sure what I was thinking.Oysters with Black Bean Sauce: This was the dish I was thinking would make it or break it. The black bean sauce actually tasted great, but the oysters themselves did not taste fresh. I stopped at one and took them away from my kids so they wouldn&#39;t poison themselves, just in case.I will not return to this place, though I can see that a lot of people like it and like I said, I may have just ordered wrong.

This is an amazing, low-end hidden venue, stairs going up to a 2nd floor right off the street. Always packed with Chinese families. If you have a group, you can eat a dinner for 8, for example, at $10-15 a head, which includes lobster and some other remarkable dishes--most notably the ginger chicken. Superb quality for the price.

I came here with three friends (2 asian, 1 white) and our waiter lady saw him and offered him a fork instead of the usual chopsticks. We refused because he&#39;s actually a world class chopstick user, but she came back a minute later and was like &#34;just in case!&#34; and dropped two forks on our table and ran away. We almost died crying.

Found this place on Yelp and by the reviews thought it must be good. Getting service was hard, they got the order wrong. Asked for hot mustard... Sorry we no have! so they gave us runny plain old mustard. Looks like they did not even shake the bottle because half was water. Overall I would not go back, the food was sort of bland and try to figure out the bill. I just paid hoping it was right. $90 for 6 people. Went with friend from Texas. We all were sort of disappointed overall.

Gross.I went with a group of people. We ordered the family meal that serves 8. It came with catfish, crab, beef ribs, steamed chicken, soup, one veggie and spring rolls.I ate the rice and spring rolls for dinner.Too much corn starch in the soup (with tofu, and who knows what else).Everyone else seemed to like it. I am too polite to bitch about food when I&#39;m eating it. I&#39;ll wait for Yelp.We got there at 6:00pm and got a table immediately. Around 7:00, there was a line out the door. In order to access the restaurant, you have to walk up a flight of stairs. The restroom inside is bizarre as it says for women only...and you have to enter it through a curtain. It&#39;s not particularly clean.I honestly thought it was the worst Chinese I&#39;ve ever had. It was greasy and just...gross.

My co-worker always talks about place..so we decided to check it out for lunch today. In front of the stairway to the resturant (its on the 2nd floor, so you have to go up the stairs) a old chinese man is greeting you and handing out menus. We got there right at noon time, and we got seated pretty quickly. Everyone that&#39;s eating there are the local old school chinese people.The lunch menu is great -$4.60 each! We ordered the beef stew (which came with fried tofu and mushrooms) and the bittermelon w/beef. It dosnt come in the usual: half entree, half rice plate - they give u a giant bowl of rice, then we get our two plates of food! Of course they are lunch sized portions..but they give you a good amt of food! Some other people around me were ordering full sized portions and they were HUGE! I mean one regular portion could easily feed 2 people! The food was super tasty and not oily like some other chinese places! While you are waiting for your food they also bring you some plain soup stock for you to drink. Total bill came out to exactly $10 bucks. and we had at least another meal to bring home (which we did take in a to-go box).This isn&#39;t your fancy americanized style chinese food here. It&#39;s straight up traditional cantonese style chinese food. I reccommend coming here with more people and sharing the plates of foods! All the plates, cups, bowls and chopsticks we used were clean too. And there was a good flow of people eating and picking up to-go orders- def. a good sign of a good restaurant.

The service was slooooow and sporadic. We sat for almost 15 minutes at our table before the waitress even came by to say hello. While ordering, the waitress kept trying to push additional items with each one I ordered. (I lost count of how many time she asked if we wanted sweet and sour pork).The food was okay. The ginger crab had very little edible meat. The walnut prawns were actually the tastiest dish we ordered.I would give it another try, but my first visit was not impressive.

Struggling between 3 and 4 stars for this place. It really only earned 3 but we had a really awesome lunch here so it would be an emotional 4.First of all, we walked right in and got a table for 8, no problem. Then we realized we were the only non-Chinese table there, which is a good sign. Menu is in English also and the waitstaff was cool with our ignorance so ordering wasn&#39;t tough.Lunch specials are $4.60 to $6.50. My date and I ordered a clay pot duck $8.50, potstickers $4.50 and a special sweet N sour chicken for $4.50. We all ate a little of what we ordered and then tasted everyone else&#39;s food.The honey walnut prawn are awesome. Beef stew too. The duck and ox tail are a little too boney for my liking but the flavor was good.And oh lord, the table behind me got a lobster thing that looked amazing.Street parking is $3 / hour but it&#39;s SF Chinatown - what do you want?Anyway, great lunch here. Good flavor. Local atmosphere. Easy for non-Chinese. I&#39;ll go right back here.

The duck was very tender and had just the right amount of 5 spice for my taste. Everything was hot ( temp), straight from the kitchen. Yum

Thank you Hong Kong Clay Pot Restaurant for giving me a reason to believe that in times of an economic downturn, you can still get a wonderfully satisfying and delicious meal for $6 dollars.Yes, you read it right. 6 freakin dollars. Thats cheaper than a gallon of milk and loaf of bread!They have lunch menus 6 days of the week (closed Wed.). For $4.60, there are over 20 options for lunch which comes with soup and rice. And for once, cheap food does not mean inedible food. In fact, everything tasted so authentic and home-y.Now is the time to look over your cubicle and act nice to your colleage. &#34;Hey, wanna have lunch today?&#34;. Then you guys can head over to Chinatown to enjoy and share several dishes. I did this with 9 colleagues and we split 10 dishes. When it came time to split the bill- $6 per person. At this rate, I might have to be nice to them everyday....

In any other city, I would give this 3 stars. But in SF&#39;s Chinatown, this doesn&#39;t cut it. Very average, however, I did not get a clay pot, which is the namesake. Maybe I ordered the wrong thing.

I have to give Hong Kong Clay Pot 4 stars. I have tried taking my in laws to many restaurants. It is hard to meet their expectations because they go out a lot and they have high expectations for Chinese food (taste, price and value). I came here with my friends last week bec&#39; my girlfriend heard great things about this place, so we decided to check it out. We ordered the pot stickers, seafood clay pot, steam oysters in black bean sauce, bittermelon frog, noodles with mushrooms and scallion lobster. All the food met my expectation. The lobster was fresh and the meat even tastes sweet. Service was ok (typical asian restaurant standard).Since I had such a good experience last week, I decided to take my in laws here tonight. They loved EVERY dish they ordered. We had pot sticker, oxtail claypot, seafood claypot, stir-fry sliced fish with green, soup for a total of $47. I think I found &#34;THE&#34; place to go with them now. yippeee!!!

SUPERRR SMALLLLLL. According to my mom, when I grew up, I use to come here alot, but I have NO clue where we were going. Theres a tiny teeny door leading to this restaurant. It&#39;s upstairs, and seems like a house or some sort. The food is by far the BEST I HAD EVER. It&#39;s so good. I think it almost satisfys my craving from China. Real-Chinese people in China make good good food. and this Restaurant has GREAT SERVICE but its a tad expensive.. maybe because the food we got was expensive. but great service! They make sure your water is filled and that your experience was good! There&#39;s maybe no more than 15 tables. I don&#39;t really remember since i&#39;m doing this review like a month or two later.. The crab/ noodles was so good. My little cousin loved the dumplings.. He said it was so-good. Walnut Shrimp, omg -_-x ORDER MOREEE! But I had a great experience, Ill come back here to eat when we go back(which is often), so dont close!! :)

You know you&#39;re in the right place when your group is the only non-Chinese speaking party in the restaurant! Hong Kong Clay Pot Restaurant is at the top of a steep, narrow staircase on Grant Street. It is not flashy in the least; the decor is understated and simple. The room is furnished with simple tables and chairs; tables by the window allow patrons to look down on busy Grant Street. The food is outstanding and the service excellent; our party of 4 - 2 adults and 2 teens - went in for lunch based on Yelp reviews. We were not disappointed. My husband had the House Special Noodle Soup, which was filled with meat and vegetables. A generous portion indeed! My son had the beef chow mein, again, a generous portion of noodles, vegetables, and delicious beef. My daughter had the egg flower soup, and claimed it was some of the best she has tasted. I had the porridge with seafood; rice in broth with seafood. It was delicious! I would go back to Hong Kong Clay Pot again in a heartbeat!

My family absolutely loved this place. As Hong Kong-neses, we all agreed that this place&#39;s food was authentic, or at least the dishes we ordered.We had the seafood claypot (thank you, Yelpers! When my parents were looking at the menu, I kept reminding them &#34;Don&#39;t forget the seafood claypot. Wait, guys, the seafood claypot is very important.&#34;) , the lamb claypot, the sweet and sour pork, and the salty fish over pork and bokchoy.I was most surprised by the sweet and sour pork. A thin, lightly-fried covering coated tender pieces of pork. No chunky, thick fried dough here.My fave of course was the seafood claypot. Melt-in-you-mouth pieces of scallops, tender shrimp, juicy black mushrooms, OH and this AMAZING soft tofu that was lightly pan-fried so it had this crispy casing on the outside and heart-warming soft white tofu inside.The lunch specials here are only $4.50 per plate, and they have big portions.Including tip, we paid $34. Man, I wish I took pictures. Just imagine four big, satisfied smiles, utterly thankful for the taste of familiarly good foods.

Easy to miss this place if you&#39;re not looking for it. But a co-worker recommended it and I went for dinner. Ordered the seafood tofu claypot - excellent. Succulent shrimp, scallops, and squid cooked perfectly, not at all rubbery. All simmering in a delicious gravy that goes perfectly over white rice. Also had the Peking pork chops - with just enough fattiness and crispiness to complement the tangy and sweet sauce coating the chops. Meal came with complementary ginseng chicken broth and sweet soup at the end. Bill was about $8/person. Pretty extensive menu, too, have to go back.

I must say I almost didn&#39;t go in to this place because it looked kind of creepy. You go up the stairs to their entrance and don&#39;t know what you are getting yourself in to. The place is small and loud but the food was delish! We had the seafood fried noodles and kung pao chicken and both were great. I really like the havy spice they use on the kung pao. Service is decent, very friendly but super busy. I want to come back and try one of their lobster dishes.

Ive eaten at this place numerous times, the food is pretty authentic Cantonese cuisine, the frog with bitter melon was pretty good but the pieces were from a very small bull frog, I prefer bigger meatier pieces.One of my favorites is the catfish cooked with salted black bean sauce and a pot of rice to go with it.

This is quite the nice find. A friend of mine heard about it through her friend so we decided to check it out. The place is tucked away up on the second floor so finding it wasn&#39;t too easy.For five people, we ordered a seafood clay pot, oysters, lobster, frog with bittermelon, and a noodle dish. We even ordered pot stickers to hold us over since we were quite hungry. The food was good and the bill came out to $60 (before tip). That&#39;s pretty cheap. Service was decent.This makes for another good Chinese option in the city. The only thing is that getting there (Chinatown) can be a little rough.

I found this place on YELP and a BIG THANK YOU!!! We were visiting San Fran last week and went in for dinner. When we first found it we were apprehensive to say the least, you walk up some less than clean stairs and enter a what-you&#39;ld-expect Chinatown diner....however, the food was fantastic!!Very authentic! The hot-sour soup was some of the best I&#39;ve had. The broccoli was better than most, but the real treat was the clay pot dishes. Highly recommend them. The seafood and the duck especially but I would guess they are all amazing!!Can&#39;t wait to return!

The food and service here isn&#39;t as good as we thought it would be.. But definitely better than other filthy foods we&#39;ve tried in Chinatown.We had the chicken and tofu claypot dish and catfish with black bean sauce.The claypot dish was mediocre.. Lots of tofu and a little bit of chicken. It needs to be more flavorful!!! Same for the catfish...Service was slow.. maybe because the place was so crowded...Good thing the food was really cheap... Otherwise we&#39;d say that this place is totally not worth going to!We&#39;re willing to give this place another shot if we&#39;re ever in Chinatown again..

Never knew this place existed in its current state after the fire at Clay Pot City. I was skeptical at first considering there were barely any guests at 10 AM on the Sunday morning I visited, but the dim sum here is not bad. The dim sum is cooked to order (no carts or ladies with trays walking around) which means everything comes out nice and hot.The steamed dumplings are pretty tasty with decently thin skin, but you there&#39;s not much difference between the scallop dumplings and shrimp dumplings... everything basically has shrimp in it. Steamed rice rolls and chicken feet are pretty good and tasty though, which is usually a good sign. I thought it was interesting that the beef balls came in a soup instead of the usual steamer... a refreshing change if you prefer things on the light side. I even braved trying the salt &amp; pepper duck tongue... which was interesting.All in all a decent place, and pretty cheap and reasonable.

In the heart of Chinatown, tightly tucked between two awnings, you&#39;ll find the small entrance to this gem. Just inside the door you&#39;ll have to climb a steep flight of stairs to get to the restaurant itself.The interior of the place is basic and unassuming and might feel a little cramped to some. During peak times, the staff will try to maximize space by seating smaller groups together at the larger tables.Everything I&#39;ve tried has been tasty and fresh. The pan-fried pot stickers are a favorite because of the chunks of ginger inside. They are definitely some of the best I&#39;ve eaten.The prices are very reasonable - two people can leave very satisfied for under $20.Bring along the address and the place will be much easier to find.

sorry clay pot, but your gonna get chopped down in this review. honestly, the food was barely....BARELY decent. our dishes were kung pao shrimp, sauted green beans, cashew chicken and a plate of egg rolls. My date and I both agreed that every dish we ate lacked flavor and quality. we were both hungry and got some advice from locals to check this place out, save yourself the trip because im sure there are better chinese food spots around town.on another note, we heard alot of people around us order pork dishes, so its possible the place may be just good at serving up good pork dishes because the place seemed to have a good street cred, but sadly the food just didnt stack up.specifically, the green beans they used were your ordinary green beans you find in the supermarket as opposed to the more delicious chinese green bean variety ( tastier, trust me).the cashew chicken was the worst dish we had. it had little flavor and was pretty ordinary (just chicken, pea pods, baby corn and cashew). nothing exciting or worth bragging about.the shrimp kung pao was decent, but nothing more than that. big pieces of shrimp but it lacked a lot of flavor and didnt taste so fresh.on the plus side, the prices are very reasonable so check this place out for its prices at best. otherwise, go spend 8-10 dollars more and have a flavorful meal somewhere else.

The seafood claypot and quail are some of the best I have ever had, and I grew up deep in Asia. Really good stuffs, and cheap also. I will try the lobster and other seafood more. I love these hole-in-the-wall places that are cheap but have excellent food. I bet to those people who rate expensive suave restaurants five stars this. I buy food from HOng Kong Claypot, I repackaged them with nice plates and stuffs, sell it in a cool-looking restaurants with a high price, and they will rave about it, giving 5 stars like crazy. Good thing is you dont have to pay a lot for honest good food. Here it is, Hong Kong Claypot.

One of my friends who is originally from Hong Kong took me here after I complained of how Nor Cal Chinese restaurants are sub-par compared to those found in San Gabriel Valley in So Cal. Not expecting much beyond the typical Americanized Chinese food found at other places in SF Chinatown I was pleasantly surprised at how good all of the dishes were. We ordered a clay hot pot, fresh fish and clams. All the food was very well prepared and tasted delicious! As for value, the prices don&#39;t get much better than this in the City as our total bill came out to be about $30 for the two of us (meal also included soap and dessert!). In the end, not sure whether i just set my expectations so low, but I do know that I will be coming back for another round as soon as i get the chance!

When we got the bill, my friend checked it &amp; the waitress conviently add on a tea ($2.50) even though she asked if we wanted any &amp; said no. She only took off $2 &amp; later told us that tip is not included in the total. My friend hates it when people say that. The food is good but asking for tip is so unsophisticated &amp; rude.*** stars for the food.

This is a split review. We ordered the honey walnut prawns which were freaking delicious the walnuts were super good the prawns were cooked perfectly. Then the other order came...we got beef chow mein which was avg and greasy...nothing special or bad. Then we got the beef clay pot....ew! First off it was more tofu then beef and second it had like some funky flavor like cinnamon or something...it was disgusting! I had to try to get rid of the flavor with pizza! The beef in the pot was nasty...it was more tendon and ligament then meat and it was not tender either... coupled with the cinnamon flavor it was awful. I would come back for the honey walnut prawns but would say the beef pot was disgusting. Also if youre an avg sized guy the prices aren&#39;t that cheap cause the portions aren&#39;t that generous. Im 175 lbs and I wasnt too full after about 27 bucks worth of food between me and my much less hungry gf. But maybe it&#39;s because I didn&#39;t eat all the beef clay pot?

Restaurant wasn&#39;t full - Sat evening 7pm. We&#39;ll try it again

I went back and forth about whether to give this place 4 or 5 stars. I don&#39;t eat Chinese food that often, and when I do, I&#39;m never really that impressed by it. Two of us went here today, and for the first time, I was amazed with Chinese food! The server was apathetic, but based on previous reviews I wasn&#39;t expecting much from that department. The food really took my hangover away!We had wonton soup, mongolian beef and sweet and sour chicken (all for well under $20). The only reason I knock off a star is because the wonton soup wasn&#39;t the best I&#39;ve had. Although the wontons were good, the broth was a little bland. I&#39;ve definitely had better.We were the only non-Asian people in there, so the place must be authentic - is that what that means?? Don&#39;t really know since, again, I don&#39;t eat much Chinese food. Authentic or not, my tastebuds approve. I would love to try the clay pots next time. The chow mein also looked really good.

Found hair in one of my dishes. All dishes ordered taste mediocre. Won&#39;t be coming back. Sauce is too thick, too much starch used.

So far my favorite Chinese restaurant in Chinatown.though it took me some time to locate it even though I walked past it few times.the reason being it&#39;s located in the upstairs between two stores.the price was very reasonable though it&#39;s for large groups and not a single person as the tables are big.

went to this place 7/2010 . the restaurant is older and the service is slow. the food however is very good and cheap, actually most of the customer during lunch time were construction people and Chinatown office staff. looks like a tourist place but more locals looking for a cheap no thrill lunch.

This place serves amazing Chinese food in great portions at very reasonable prices. Average entrees are between $8-12. The space is a bit crowded, but for the quality of food, I&#39;ll take it! The food is cheap and delicious and the service is good - couldn&#39;t ask for more! I recommend the Honey Walnut Prawns and Kung Pao Chicken.

Pot stickers was pretty descent. It would have been a lot better if they fried both sides. The fish clay pot was very good. The hot and sour soup was off the charts. It wasn&#39;t &#34;americanized&#34; for tourist. I would have never walked into the place if it wasn&#39;t for yelp. Service wasn&#39;t the best but the food made up for it.

HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE SERVICE! I was so looking forward to eating here after the seeing the reviews. My husband and I made a trip to Chinatown to do a little shopping and stop at the HK Clay Pot to eat. The man at the bottom of the stairs that handed us the menu was very cheery and all seemed well until we got into the restaurant. The waiter was abrupt and rude. He brought the tea that comes with your meal and never brought our waters we requested. I asked him a 2nd time after seeing him pass us several times seating new people, wiping tables and other little things. When I asked a 2nd time he mumbled ok and looked bothered, still after 15 minutes never brought water. I had to get it from another server. He never once came to us after he served us. The other server noticed he wasn&#39;t helping us after another customer yelled at him for the same thing and she told him to give us our check. He finally brought us our check almost 25 minutes after we were done eating. I have never experienced such terrible service. I must say the food was good but the service was so terrible it was not worth it. I would never go back there again!

This will be my &#34;go-to&#34; restaurant in Chinatown. Not touristy at all. Everything was very good, hot and plentiful. Sort of hidden since it&#39;s up a flight of stairs. I wish it was closer to my workplace so I could have lunch there!

I came here while on vacation with my family. My wife is from taiwan and we always search out vacation spots with a good chinatown. Everything we had here had great flavor and was served immediatly. The seafood claypot had great flavor and I highly recommend it. We even came back a second time during our trip meeting some of my local relatives. The wait staff can be a little slow but the food made up for any issue.

Favourite Chinese restaurant! Great food and low price make this restaurant a great one. The fish claypot is a must-try dish. This restaurant comes with a house soup and dessert with every dine-in, so you can ask for them if they are not served.

Apparently, Hong Kong Clay Pot has had a bit of a rough year or so. A fire is enough to close a place down permanently, but losing the cook too!? Not a good sign...Now, I&#39;ve just given this place a try within the last 2 weeks, and I have no comparisons with their offerings of Dim Sum in the past, which they apparently no longer serve. But this place has become my defacto lunch standard. I work downtown near Market and 3rd, and even though it&#39;s a little bit of a walk, 2 of my work buddies and I brave the elements twice a week to enjoy their fresh, plentiful and inexpensive offerings.Recommend the seafood stir-fry and the seafood porridge. We&#39;ll share our orders, come out of there stuffed and only paying $6-8 a piece including tip. Can&#39;t beat that for lunch!

Grab the flyer and head upstairs. The authentic dim sum is very hot and fresh and not too greasy or expensive. You order off the checklist menu, which is almost as fun as the carts. Do any Chinatown dim sum places have carts? They should.

The seafood claypot and chicken/tofu claypot are great. It was a mistake to order two claypots at one time, because it got a little repetitive. Overall it was a good meal though. Very authentic.
